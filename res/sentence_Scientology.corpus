For the organization, see Church of Scientology .
The Scientology symbol is composed of the letter S, which stands for Scientology, and the ARC and KRC triangles , two important concepts in Scientology.
Scientology is legally recognized as a tax-exempt religion in the United States , Italy ,   South Africa ,  Australia ,  Sweden ,  the Netherlands ,  New Zealand ,   Portugal ,  and Spain ;      the Church of Scientology emphasizes this as proof that it is a bona fide religion.
A large number of organizations overseeing the application of Scientology have been established,  the most notable of these being the Church of Scientology.
These include the Narconon anti-drug program, the Criminon prison rehabilitation program, the Study Tech education methodology, the Volunteer Ministers , the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises , and a set of moral guidelines expressed in a booklet called The Way to Happiness .
The Church of Scientology has consistently used litigation against its critics, and its aggressiveness in pursuing its foes has been condemned as harassment.
Further controversy has focused on Scientology s belief that souls   thetans   reincarnate and have lived on other planets before living on Earth  and that some of the related teachings are not revealed to practitioners until they have paid thousands of dollars to the Church of Scientology.
The word Scientology is a pairing of the Latin word scientia   knowledge ,  skill  , which comes from the verb scīre   to know  , and the Greek λόγος lógos   word  or  account   .
In 1901, Allen Upward coined Scientology  as a disparaging term, to indicate a blind, unthinking acceptance of scientific doctrine  according to the Internet Sacred Text Archive as quoted in the preface to Forgotten Books  recent edition of Upward s book, The New Word: On the meaning of the word Idealist.
This was an important factor in the transition from secular Dianetics to the more supernaturalistic Scientology, but more to the point, Hubbard saw that Dianetics was about to fail from its inherent individualism which set each person as his own authority.
It has been suggested that Hubbard started the more religious mode of Scientology to establish an overarching authority—his own.
Scholarly conjecture discusses the likelihood of the Church of Scientology falsifying the numbers of Dianetics books sold; the Church says more than 90 million.
In 1952, Hubbard built on the existing framework set forth in Dianetics, and published a new set of teachings as Scientology, a religious philosophy.
In December 1953, Hubbard incorporated three churches – a  Church of American Science , a  Church of Scientology  and a  Church of Spiritual Engineering  – in Camden, New Jersey .
On February 18, 1954, with Hubbard s blessing, some of his followers set up the first local Church of Scientology, the Church of Scientology of California, adopting the  aims, purposes, principles and creed of the Church of American Science, as founded by L.
The second local Church of Scientology to be set up, after the one in California, was in Auckland, New Zealand .
In 1955, Hubbard established the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.
In 1957, the Church of Scientology of California was granted tax-exempt status by the United States Internal Revenue Service  IRS , and so, for a time, were other local churches.
The United States Food and Drug Administration  FDA  began an investigation concerning the claims the Church of Scientology made in connection with its E-meters.
On January 4, 1963, they raided offices of the Church of Scientology and seized hundreds of E-meters as illegal medical devices.
In the mid-sixties, the Church of Scientology was banned in several Australian states, starting with Victoria in 1965.
It is the firm conclusion of this Board that most scientology and dianetic techniques are those of authoritative hypnosis and as such are dangerous .
Many scientology techniques are in fact hypnotic techniques, and Hubbard has not changed their nature by changing their names.
The Australian Church was forced to operate under the name of the  Church of the New Faith  as a result, the name and practice of Scientology having become illegal in the relevant states.
In the course of developing Scientology, Hubbard presented rapidly changing teachings that some have seen as often self-contradictory.
In 1966, Hubbard stepped down as executive director of Scientology to devote himself to research and writing.
The following year, he formed the Sea Organization or Sea Org , which was to develop into an elite group within Scientology.
In 1967, the IRS removed Scientology s tax-exempt status, asserting that its activities were commercial and operated for the benefit of Hubbard, rather than for charitable or religious purposes.
In 1981, Scientology took the German government to court for the first time.
On January 1, 1982, Scientology established the Religious Technology Center  RTC  to oversee and ensure the standard application of Scientology technology.
The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and believes that the Church of Scientology has departed from its original philosophy.
In 1983, in a unanimous decision, the High Court of Australia recognized Scientology as a religion in Australia, overturning restrictions that had limited activities of the church after the Anderson Report.
Starting in 1991, persons connected with Scientology filed fifty lawsuits against the Cult Awareness Network  CAN , a group that had been critical of Scientology.
A new Cult Awareness Network was set up with Scientology backing, which operates as an information and networking center for non-traditional religions, referring callers to academics and other experts.
Church of Scientology against Steven Fishman, a former member of the Church, Fishman made a court declaration which included several dozen pages of formerly secret esoterica detailing aspects of Scientologist cosmogony .
As a result of the litigation, this material, normally strictly safeguarded and used only in Scientology s more advanced  OT levels , found its way onto the Internet.
This resulted in a battle between the Church of Scientology and its online critics over the right to disclose this material, or safeguard its confidentiality.
The Church of Scientology was forced to issue a press release acknowledging the existence of this cosmogony, rather than allow its critics  to distort and misuse this information for their own purposes.
Even so, the material, notably the story of Xenu , has since been widely disseminated and used to caricature Scientology, despite the Church s vigorous program of copyright litigation.
In 2005, the Church of Scientology stated its worldwide membership to be eight million, although that number included people who took only the introductory course and did not continue on.
Worldwide, some observers believe a reasonable estimate of Scientology s core practicing membership ranges between 100,000 and 200,000, mostly in the U.
The Church of Scientology claims to be the fastest growing religious movement on earth.
In the UK scientology is declining.
Like Hinduism , Scientology posits a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one s present life, and with each rebirth, the effects of the MEST universe  MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time  on the thetan become stronger.
To avoid this fate is Scientology s basic goal.
The Scientology symbol is composed of the letter S, which stands for Scientology, and the ARC and KRC triangles, two important concepts in Scientology.
In Scientology, rationality is stressed over morality.
These two triangles are present in the Scientology symbol.
The Church of Scientology says that  the horizontal bar represents the material universe, and the vertical bar represents the spirit.
While Scientology states that many social problems are the unintentional results of people s imperfections, it asserts that there are also truly malevolent individuals.
In Scientology, defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons,     and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors.
Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of Preclear to Clear and Operating Thetan.
Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or auditor.
Seeking spiritual development within Scientology is undertaken by studying Scientology materials.
Scientology materials  called Technology or Tech in Scientology jargon   are structured in sequential levels  or gradients , so that easier steps are taken first and greater complexities are handled at the appropriate time.
The Church of Scientology believes in the principle of reciprocity, involving give-and-take in every human transaction.
These are the OT levels, the levels above Clear, whose contents are guarded within Scientology.
This occurred after the teachings were submitted as evidence in court cases involving Scientology, thus becoming a matter of public record.
The highest level, OT VIII, is disclosed only at sea on the Scientology cruise ship Freewinds .
A large Church of Spiritual Technology symbol carved into the ground at Scientology s Trementina Base is visible from the air.
In Scientology, ceremonies for events such as weddings, child naming, and funerals are observed.
Ordained Scientology ministers may perform such rites.
According to Hubbard himself, Scientology is  the Western anglicized continuance of many early forms of wisdom.
Ankerberg and Weldon mention the sources of Scientology to include  the Vedas, Buddhism, Judaism, Gnosticism, Taoism, early Greek civilization and the teachings of Jesus, Nietzsche and Freud.
Beyond that, Hubbard himself named a great many other influences in his own writing – in Scientology 8-8008, for example, these include philosophers from Anaxagoras and Aristotle to Herbert Spencer and Voltaire , physicists and mathematicians like Euclid and Isaac Newton , as well as founders of religions such as Buddha , Confucius , Jesus and Mohammed  – but there is little evidence in Hubbard s writings that he studied these figures to any great depth.
As noted, there are elements of Eastern religions evident in Scientology,  in particular the concepts of karma , as present in Hinduism and in Jainism , and dharma .
In addition to the links to Hindu texts, Hubbard tried to connect Scientology with Taoism and Buddhism .
According to the Encyclopedia of Community, Scientology  shows affinities with Buddhism and a remarkable similarity to first-century Gnosticism.
In the 1940s, Hubbard was in contact with Jack Parsons , a rocket scientist and member of the Ordo Templi Orientis then led by Aleister Crowley , and there have been suggestions that this connection influenced some of the ideas and symbols of Scientology.
Gordon Melton have stated that Crowley s teachings bear little if any resemblance to Scientology doctrine.
Lewis , Scientology is in the same lineage of supernatural religious movements such as New Thought .
Lewis wrote,  Scientology sees their psycho-spiritual technology as supplying the missing ingredient in existing technologies—namely, the therapeutic engineering of the human psyche.
There are a considerable number of Scientology organizations  or orgs  which generally support one of the following three aims: enabling Scientology practice and training, promoting the wider application of Scientology technology, or campaigning for social change.
The internal structure of Scientology organizations is strongly bureaucratic, with detailed coordination of activities and collection of stats – or statistics, to measure organizational and individual performance.
Ethics officers are present in every org; they are tasked with ensuring correct application of Scientology technology and deal with violations such as non-compliance with standard procedures or any other behavior adversely affecting an org s performance, ranging from errors and misdemeanors to crimes and suppressive acts, as defined by internal documents.
A controversial part of the Scientology justice system is the Rehabilitation Project Force  RPF .
Many Scientologists  first contact with Scientology is through local informal groups and field auditors practicing Dianetics counseling.
In addition to these, Scientology operates hundreds of Churches and Missions around the world.
They are also required to adhere to the standards established by the Religious Technology Center  RTC , which supervises the application of Scientology tech, owns the trademarks and service marks of Scientology, and collaborates with the Commodore s Messenger Organization to administer and control the various corporate entities within Scientology.
According to Melton, the Religious Technology Center “preserves, maintains and protects Scientology against misuse or misinterpretation” but is not involved in Scientology daily affairs or management.
The RTC s Chairman is David Miscavige , who, while not the titular head of the Church of Scientology, is believed to be the most powerful person in the Scientology movement.
Beyond OT V, the Flag Service Organization in Clearwater, Florida , offers the auditing and course work for OT levels VI and VII, while OT VIII is offered only by the Flag Ship Service Organization aboard the Scientology ship Freewinds.
Since 1981, all of these Churches and organizations have been united under the Church of Scientology International umbrella organization, with the Sea Org providing staff for all levels above the local Churches and Missions.
In 2012, the Ideal Center of Scientology for the Middle East opened in a refurbished historic building in Jaffa , Israel .
A number of Scientology organizations specialize in promoting the use of Scientology technology as a means to solve social problems.
The World Institute of Scientology Enterprises  WISE  is a not-for-profit organization which licenses Hubbard s management techniques for use in businesses.
The Church of Scientology has also instituted a Volunteer Ministers program to provide disaster relief; for example, Volunteer Ministers were active in the aftermath of 9 11 , providing food and water and applying Scientology methods such as   Assists   to people in acute emotional distress.
The Scientology Volunteer Ministers also used the  assist  to help Haiti quake victims.
Some Scientology organizations are focused on bringing about social change.
Ever since, Scientology has argued that psychiatry suffers from the fundamental flaw of ignoring humanity s spiritual dimension, and that it fails to take into account Hubbard s insights about the nature of the mind.
To mitigate crime,  Scientologists foster a volunteer minister program outlined in Hubbard s Scientology Handbook  1976  to save troubled marriages, resolve community conflict, end gang warfare, promote literacy and study skills and improve business prospects.
Church of Spiritual Technology , a non-profit organization that owns the copyrights to Scientology books.
Although Scientology is most often used as shorthand for the Church of Scientology , a number of groups practice Scientology and Dianetics outside of the official church.
These groups, collectively known as the Free Zone or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the official Church of Scientology, as well as entirely new members.
The church labels these groups as   squirrels   in Scientology jargon and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.
More recently, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder have championed the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church.
The Church of Scientology has pursued an extensive public relations campaign for the recognition of Scientology as a religion in the various countries in which it exists.
Opinions around the world still differ on whether Scientology is to be recognized as a religion or not,  and Scientology has often encountered opposition due to its strong-arm tactics directed against critics and members wishing to leave the organization.
The differences between these classifications have become a major problem when discussing religions in general and Scientology specifically.
Recognition came in 1993,  when the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  stated that   operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes.
The New York Times noted in this connection that the Church of Scientology had funded a campaign which included a whistle-blower organization to publicly attack the IRS, as well as the hiring of private investigators to look into the private lives of IRS officials.
In 1991, Miscavige, the highest-ranking Scientology leader, arranged a meeting with Fred T.
The committee met several times with the Scientology legal team and  was persuaded that those involved in the Snow White crimes had been purged, that church money was devoted to tax-exempt purposes and that, with Mr.
Hubbard s death, no one was getting rich from Scientology.
Both the IRS and Scientology rejected any allegations of foul play or undue pressure having been brought to bear upon IRS officials, insisting that the decision had been based on the merits of the case.
IRS officials  insisted that Scientology s tactics had not affected the decision  and that  ultimately the decision was made on a legal basis .
Miscavige claims that the IRS’s examination of Scientology was the most exhaustive review of any non-profit organization in history.
Elsewhere, Scientology has been able to obtain religious recognition in such countries as Australia,   Portugal,  Spain,   Slovenia ,  Sweden,    Croatia ,  Hungary  and Kyrgyzstan .
In New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department classified the Church of Scientology as a charitable organization and stated that its income would be tax exempt.
It has gained judicial recognition in Italy,  and Scientology officials have won the right to perform marriages in South Africa.
In the UK, the Charity Commission for England and Wales ruled in 1999 that Scientology was not a religion and refused to register the Church as a charity, although a year later, it was recognized as a not-for-profit body in a separate proceeding by the UK Revenue and Customs and exempted from UK value added tax .
In December 2013, the United Kingdom’s highest court officially recognized Scientology as a religion.
The ruling was a response to a five-year legal battle by Scientologist Louisa Hodkin, who legally fought for the right to marry at the Church of Scientology chapel in central London.
Since 1997 Germany has considered Scientology to be in conflict with the principles of the nation s constitution.
Germany will continue to monitor Scientology s activities in the country, despite continued objection from Scientology which cites such monitoring as abuse of freedom of religion.
France and Belgium have not recognized Scientology as a religion, and Stephen A.
The Belgian State Prosecution Service has recommended that various individuals and organizations associated with Scientology should be prosecuted.
In Greece, Scientology is not recognized as a religion by the Greek government, and multiple applications for religious status have been denied, for example in 2000 and 2003.
In 2000, the Italian Supreme Court ruled that Scientology is a religion for legal purposes.
Describing the available scholarship on Scientology, David G.
Cowan stated in 2006 that  most scholars have concluded that Scientology falls within the category of religion for the purposes of academic study, and a number have defended the Church in judicial and political proceedings on this basis.
Urban writes that  Scientology s efforts to get itself defined as a religion make it an ideal case study for thinking about how we understand and define religion.
According to the Encyclopedia of Religious Controversies in the United States,  even as Scientology raises questions about how and who gets to define religion, most scholars recognize it as a religion, one that emerges from and builds on American individualism and the spiritual marketplace that dominated 1950 s America.
Bromley and Cowan noted in 2008 that Scientology s attempts  to gain favor with new religion scholars  had often been problematic.
According to Religious Studies professor Mary Farrell Benarowski, Scientology describes itself as drawing on science, religion, psychology and philosophy but  had been claimed by none of them and repudiated, for the most part, by all.
Louis wrote,  it is abundantly clear that Scientology has both the typical forms of ceremonial and celebratory worship and its own unique form of spiritual life.
Flinn further states that religion requires  beliefs in something transcendental or ultimate, practices  rites and codes of behavior  that re-inforce those beliefs and, a community that is sustained by both the beliefs and practices , all of which are present within Scientology.
Similarly, Jacob Neusner, editor of World Religions in America, states that  Scientology contains the same elements of most other religions, including myths, scriptures, doctrines, worship, sacred practices and rituals, moral and ethical expectations, a community of believers, clergy, and ecclesiastic organizations.
While acknowledging that a number of his colleagues accept Scientology as a religion, sociologist Stephen A.
Kent writes:  Rather than struggling over whether or not to label Scientology as a religion, I find it far more helpful to view it as a multifaceted transnational corporation, only one element of which is religious  .
For example, Scientology—a system of beliefs that a human being is essentially a free and immortal spirit who merely inhabits a body—does not propound the existence of a supreme being, but it qualifies as a religion under the broad definition propounded by the Supreme Court.
Gordon Melton asserts that while the debate over definitions of religion will continue, “scholars will probably continue in the future to adopt a broad definition, thus including Scientology in a wider religious field.
Either way, Scientology is perhaps most different from other UFO groups in their attempt to keep all of the space opera stuff under wraps.
While NRM scholars have generally accepted the religious nature of Scientology, media reports have tended to express the opinion that  Scientology is a business, often given to criminal acts, and sometimes masquerading as a religion.
During his lifetime, Hubbard was accused of using religion as a façade for Scientology to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims.
Frenschkowski allows that there naturally were practical considerations about  how to present Scientology to the outside world , but dismisses the notion that presentation as a religion was just an expedient pretense, pointing to many passages in Hubbard s works that document his struggle with this issue.
As in the case of similar movements, it was quite unclear to Hubbard in the beginning what Scientology would become.
The Church of Scientology denounces the idea of Hubbard starting a religion for personal gain as an unfounded rumor.
It claims copyright and trademark over its  Scientology cross , and its lawyers have threatened lawsuits against individuals and organizations who have published the image in books and on Web sites.
Because of this, it is very difficult for individual groups to attempt to publicly practice Scientology on their own, independent of the official Church of Scientology.
The Church of Scientology and its many related organizations have amassed considerable real estate holdings worldwide, likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Scientology encourages existing members to  sell  Scientology to others by paying a commission to those who recruit new members.
Scientology franchises, or missions, must pay the Church of Scientology roughly 10% of their gross income.
In conjunction with the Church of Scientology s request to be officially recognized as a religion in Germany, around 1996 the German state Baden-Württemberg conducted a thorough investigation regarding the group s activities within Germany.
The results of this investigation indicated that at the time of publication, Scientology s main sources of revenue   Haupteinnahmequellen der SO   were from course offerings and sales of their various publications.
Official German information leaflets from the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution on  from left to right  Islamic extremism , Scientology, and organized crime .
Several states published pamphlets about Scientology  and other religious groups  that detailed the Church s ideology and practices.
States defended the practice by noting their responsibility to respond to citizens  requests for information about Scientology as well as other subjects.
While many of the pamphlets were factual and relatively unbiased, some warned of alleged dangers posed by Scientology to the political order, to the free market economic system, and to the mental and financial well being of individuals.
Beyond the Government s actions, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church have been public opponents of Scientology.
Of the many new religious movements to appear during the 20th century, the Church of Scientology has, from its inception, been one of the most controversial , coming into conflict with the governments and police forces of several countries  including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada,  France  and Germany .
Reports and allegations have been made, by journalists, courts, and governmental bodies of several countries, that the Church of Scientology is an unscrupulous commercial enterprise that harasses its critics and brutally exploits its members.
Time magazine published an article in 1991 which described Scientology as  a hugely profitable global racket that survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafia-like manner.
Scientology s disconnection policy, in which members are encouraged to cut off all contact with friends or family members who are  antagonistic  to Scientology.
Robert Minton sponsored the multi-million dollar lawsuit against Scientology for the death of McPherson.
In May 2004, McPherson s estate and the Church of Scientology reached a confidential settlement.
Allegations by a former high-ranking Scientologist that Scientology leader David Miscavige beats and demoralizes staff, and that physical violence by superiors towards staff working for them is a common occurrence in the church.
In October 2009, a French court found the Church of Scientology guilty of organized fraud.
Prosecutors had hoped to achieve a ban of Scientology in France, but due to a temporary change in French law, which  made it impossible to dissolve a legal entity on the grounds of fraud , no ban was pronounced.
In November 2009, Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used a speech in Federal Parliament to allege that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organization.
As stated in Scientology doctrine:  The whole agonized future of this planet, every man, woman and child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology.
Kent has described Scientology s ethics system as  a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefited  .
In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people s interests in things other than Scientology.
In the 1990s, representatives of Scientology began to take action against increased criticism of Scientology on the Internet.
The organization says that the actions taken were to prevent distribution of copyrighted Scientology documents and publications online, fighting what it refers to as  copyright terrorists .
Among the criticisms raised, one suggestion is that Scientology s true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics.
An Internet-based group which refers to itself as   Anonymous   held protests outside Scientology centers in cities around the world in February 2008 as part of Project Chanology .
Some of the DMCA  s provisions  notably the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act   were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US Internet service providers over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers.
On January 14, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Tom Cruise was leaked to the Internet and uploaded to YouTube .
The Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube requesting the removal of the video.
Subsequently, the group Anonymous voiced its criticism of Scientology and began attacking the Church.
Calling the action by the Church of Scientology a form of Internet censorship , participants of Anonymous coordinated Project Chanology , which consisted of a series of denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites, prank calls , and black faxes to Scientology centers.
On January 21, 2008, Anonymous announced its intentions via a video posted to YouTube entitled  Message to Scientology , and a press release declaring a  war  against both the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center .
In the press release, the group stated that the attacks against the Church of Scientology would continue in order to protect the freedom of speech , and end what they saw as the financial exploitation of church members.
A protester criticizes Scientology.
On January 28, 2008, an Anonymous video appeared on YouTube calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008.
Many protesters wore masks based on the character V from V for Vendetta  who was influenced by Guy Fawkes   or otherwise disguised their identities, in part to protect themselves from reprisals from the Church of Scientology.
The Arbitration Committee of the Wikipedia internet encyclopedia decided in May 2009 to restrict access to its site from Church of Scientology IP addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by Scientologists.
Auditing records are referred to within Scientology as preclear folders.
The Church of Scientology has strict codes designed to protect the confidentiality of the information contained in these folders.
However, people leaving Scientology know that the Church is in possession of very personal information about them, and that the Church has a history of attacking and psychologically abusing those who leave it and become critics.
Hubbard envisaged that celebrities would have a key role to play in the dissemination of Scientology, and in 1955 launched Project Celebrity, creating a list of 63 famous people that he asked his followers to target for conversion to Scientology.
Ron Hubbard wrote,  The purpose of  Celebrity Centre is, to forward the expansion and popularization of Scientology through the arts.
Former silent-screen star Gloria Swanson and jazz pianist Dave Brubeck were among the earliest celebrities attracted to Hubbard s teachings; in recent decades, prominent actors—including Tom Cruise and John Travolta —have spoken publicly about their commitment to Scientology.
Scientology operates eight churches that are designated Celebrity Centres , the largest of these is in Hollywood, California, called Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International.

Marty  Rathbun left the Church of Scientology staff in late 2004, ending a 27-year career that saw him rise to be a top lieutenant under church leader David Miscavige.
Contacted that month by the Tampa Bay Times, Rathbun agreed to tell the story of his years in Scientology and what led to his leaving.
Thus began the long-running Tampa Bay Times series,  Inside Scientology,  which sheds unprecedented light on the internal workings of a secretive church that counts Clearwater as its spiritual home.
The Times  conversations with Rathbun led to interviews with scores of other people in the Scientology world, including former staffers, former parishioners and current church members.
The result of the Times  reporting is this multi-part special report, the latest in a long history of Scientology coverage by the newspaper.
The Times won a Pulitzer Prize for a 1979 report on Scientology.
Joe Childs, Senior Editor At Large, ran the Times Clearwater operation dating to 1993 and supervised the newspaper s Scientology coverage.

The present volume brings together an international group of top scholars on New    Religious Movements to offer an extensive and even-handed overview and analysis    of all of these aspects of Scientology, including the controversies to which it    continues to give rise.
Lawrence Wright,  Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief,  Vintage, 2013-NOV, 560 pages.
Through it all, Wright asks what   fundamentally comprises a religion, and if Scientology in fact merits   this Constitutionally-protected label.

The word Scientology is taken from the Latin scio, which means  knowing, in the fullest sense of the word,  and the Greek word logos, meaning  study of.
Although modern life seems to pose an infinitely complex array of problems, Scientology maintains that the solutions to those problems are basically simple and within every man s reach.

Ron Hubbard, Scientology is a religion that offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one’s true spiritual nature and one’s relationship to self, family, groups, Mankind, all life forms, the material universe, the spiritual universe and the Supreme Being.
Drawn from half a century of research, the articles in this book encompass Scientology basics for all parts of existence, answers to questions Man has sought through the ages; answers you hoped could be found somewhere, answers that work.
Though it draws on the wisdom of some 50,000 years, Scientology is a new religion, one that has isolated fundamental laws of life and, for the first time, developed a workable technology that can be applied to help people achieve a happier and more spiritual existence in the here and now.
That Scientology’s development and rapid promulgation was made possible, in part, by advances in the physical sciences through the first half of the twentieth century is significant.
In that way, Scientology constitutes Man’s first real application of scientific methodology to spiritual questions.
In Scientology, that search has culminated—for the secret has now been discovered.
And with exact Scientology techniques, you’ll discover them for yourself.
Because Scientology is the knowledge of you.
While the hope for spiritual freedom is ancient, what Scientology is doing is new.
Because Scientology addresses Man as a spiritual being, it stands completely apart from other fields which see Man as a product of his environment or his genes—fixed in the limitations under which he was born.
In contrast, Scientology is the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes and other life.
And unlike other efforts of improvement, which offered only rules by which men should live, Scientology offers real tools for use in everyday life.
In Scientology no one is asked to accept anything as belief or on faith.
An individual discovers for himself that Scientology works by personally applying its principles and observing or experiencing results.
For the subject matter of Scientology is you.
No matter the difficulties you may be facing in life, Scientology offers answers.

An Ideal Org is configured to provide the full services of the Scientology religion to its parishioners, while also serving the community with social betterment and outreach programs.
Karen de la Carriere, 70, was a member of the Church of Scientology for 35 years.
And for six months, she claims she was held against her will in a section of Scientology’s Int Base in the Californian desert known by members as  The Hole , while her husband was sent to Germany and her baby kept from her.
The Church of Scientology has vigorously responded to Karen s claims and dismissed her as somebody who  will literally say anything to get attention .
Karen said:  Scientology is like tsunami of destruction.
Speaking from her home in Los Angeles, barely 40 minutes drive from the compound in which she was held all those years ago, she explained:  The dark part of Scientology never surfaces as you enter the door, but the higher up the levels you go the more it s brought out.
Karen was in her early twenties and living in London when she was introduced to Scientology by a boyfriend.
The love affair didn t last, but she was hooked on Scientology from her first Audit.
Auditing is central to Scientology.
But I swore as I ran round that track, one day I will tell the story about what really goes on in the Church of Scientology.
Until that point, Karen admitted, she had been aware of punishments but had believed completely Scientology s teaching that any punishment was something a person  pulled in  towards themselves through their own  evil intentions .
Karen claimed Heber was sent to Germany and her son was taken to a Scientology Nursery.
He is in regular touch with family and friends, participates in Scientology services as a church parishioner, but given his age no longer makes public appearances on behalf of the church .
But first members of the Church of Scientology sign contracts locking them into the faith not only for this lifetime but all the lives they believe come after.
In never-before-seen contracts for potential members of the elite Sea Org - seen by MailOnline - members jettison family or friends opposed to Scientology, absolve the church of any liability, surrender their right to sue or reclaim donations and give the church license to hold them hostage under 24 hour guard with no limit of time.
Similarly though the church denies any policy of  disconnecting  believers from family who are critical, members must state:  I am not connected with any person, such as by marital or familial ties, of known antagonism to spiritual treatment or to Scientology .
They accept that this means  being isolated from all sources of potential upset, including but not limited to family members, friends or others ,  specifically consent to Church members being with me 24 hours a day ,  fully accept that the duration of any such isolation is uncertain  and determined by the church and absolve Scientology of any  known and unknown risks of injury, loss or damage  that might result.
Heber was sent off to Germany – the government was investigating Scientology as a dangerous cult – and my son who was about two-years-old at the time was left in Los Angeles in a Scientology Nursery.
Again and again she was asked if she intended to  destroy Scientology  or if she had  an evil intention to destroy David Miscavige.
I m speaking against the abuses that take place in the name of Scientology.
Karen will always blame Scientology for her son s death.
I m speaking against the abuses that take place in the name of Scientology.

Since 1973, the Château Élysée has been owned by the Church of Scientology, which calls it Celebrity Centre.
The first Scientology church was established in downtown Los Angeles, in 1954.
Although the Church’s spiritual headquarters are in Clearwater, Florida, and it has facilities around the world, Scientology is most deeply associated with Los Angeles and its entertainment industry.
The dozens of local buildings owned by the Church, many of them historically significant and now prominently marked with posters advertising “Dianetics” or with the eight-pointed cross that serves as one of Scientology’s symbols, have entered the landscape of iconic L.
Diane Kanner, an architectural historian who specializes in twentieth-century Los Angeles, calls the building Château Scientology.
From the outset, the conversion of celebrities was important to Scientology.
It is obvious what would happen to Scientology if prime communicators benefitting from it would mention it now and then.
Though Scientology is not known to have had success with this early group, the movement now counts Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, and many other celebrities as members.
Celebrity Centre is used for Scientology courses and for “auditing,” a mainstay of the religion, in which a person undergoes a guided talk-therapy session, usually while holding a device known as an E-Meter, which is supposed to measure one’s spiritual state.
The goal is to eliminate “mental image pictures” associated with traumatic events; when a person is “Clear”—freed of all such associations—he can advance to the mystical and esoteric levels of Scientology.
The path to becoming an “Operating Thetan,” or pure spiritual being  “thetan” being Hubbard’s word for the soul , is laid out in a table called “The Bridge to Total Freedom: Scientology Classification Gradation and Awareness Chart of Levels and Certificates.
In the Holiday 2007 Dianetics and Scientology catalogue, a deluxe Planetary Dissemination Edition E-Meter—billed as a “tool for Golden Age of Tech certainty,” to assist in “faster progress up The Bridge”—was offered, in “Diamond Blue,” for five thousand five hundred dollars.
An undated leaflet advertising “a safe environment for Celebrities and Scientologists” contains a plug from Travolta: “Good rest, good food, good service but most of all I felt very safe in this space”; Celebrity, a magazine produced by Celebrity Centre, which features a Scientology celebrity on the cover of every issue, urges readers to stay at the hotel for five to six weeks “to complete your Basics books & lectures courses faster!
Hollywood’s not a very easy industry to bust into,” Hilary Royce, a former dancer who went to Sarah Lawrence and is now the director of community affairs for the Church of Scientology International, told me.

There’s so much interest in Scientology.
A longside glowing testimonials from people—celebrities and not—who credit Scientology for personal transformation, there are stories of savings spent, lives derailed, critics harassed.
Ken Bernstein, the head of the city’s Office for Historic Resources, put it this way: “Celebrities equivalent to today’s Scientology celebrities—people who had that level of glamour and prestige—were significantly associated with that building.
The Church of Scientology bought the Château Élysée for a million dollars from a group affiliated with the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, which had been using it since the nineteen-fifties as a retirement home.
Church of Scientology International, said that the R.
Ron Hubbard Way—including the American Saint Hill Organization, a Scientology college—is known to Church members as Pacific Area Command.
Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition and the office of the Church’s international management, as well as an office of its Religious Technology Center, which holds the trademarks for Dianetics and Scientology, and, according to Church literature, “was created to meet the need to ensure the standard application of the technology and to eliminate any possibility of Scientology falling into the wrong hands.
But for the Church of Scientology, a new religion with limitless ambition and a sharp awareness of the importance of image, rehabilitating elegant old buildings serves both as a powerful means of repairing its reputation and as a tangible metaphor for that work.
The Church of Scientology was one of the few things going; often, in those days, theirs were the only lights on after dark.
The Church of Scientology has always made those two things synonymous in its work.
Hilary Royce, Scientology’s community liaison, says that other property owners on the boulevard have come to the Church for advice about how to renovate their buildings.
One afternoon in December, after an extensive tour of Scientology properties, I went to the Renaissance for lunch with Royce, Adams, and Greg LaClaire, of Celebrity Centre.
He went on, “A huge percentage of Scientologists who are well known weren’t well known before Scientology.
From 1971, the Celebrity Centre motto: “Real celebrities deserve the best in staff and service and image”; from 1973, “The purpose of Celebrity Centre is: to forward the expansion and popularization of Scientology through the arts, while remaining solvent and using highest quality tech.
Earlier, Royce had said that if a non-artist or non-celebrity wanted to pursue Scientology at Celebrity Centre, “they wouldn’t be turned away, but we might recommend a different church.
Here’s the big picture with Scientology and Dianetics,” she said.
The walls were hung with colorful posters and flat-screen televisions playing videos to illustrate the major principles of Scientology.

A former executive of the Church of Scientology said three members of the church’s top management ambushed him at Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday morning, and that he has video footage to prove it.
The video, in which top Scientology leaders are seen yelling obscenities, is the first public glimpse of the secretive church’s top management in four years.
Mark Rathbun, a former senior executive of the Church of Scientology who has been an outspoken critic since quitting in 2004, said he had just cleared security at the airport when the three ambushed him.
The video “affords a very rare glimpse at the personalities who are actually running Scientology at the highest levels,” Rathbun told International Business Times.
According to him, Scientology’s top leaders have not been seen in public since appearing on CNN in 2010.
He has also produced several documentaries about the church, wrote the book “Memoirs of a Scientology Warrior” that appeared last year, and runs a blog .
A request for comment from the Church of Scientology had not been answered by the time of publication.
He said the Church of Scientology has not contacted him since Sunday s video appeared on YouTube, where it has garnered 340,000 views so far.
Perkins, his mother and father, his sister, and her husband are all members of the Church of Scientology, a group that believes modern psychiatric medicine derives from an ancient alien civilization s plot to drug and enslave humanity.
Unfortunately, Scientology s own brand of therapy, called  auditing , is worthless.
Elli Perkins was a senior auditor  counselor  at the Church of Scientology of Buffalo, New York .
Jeremy himself had taken Scientology courses there, and was even flown out to Los Angeles to join Scientology s paramilitary Sea Organization, although he was promptly sent back home due to his mental problems.

This project included a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members, in more than 30 countries.
This operation also exposed the Scientology plot  Operation Freakout , because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the US government investigation of the Church.
And of course Issac Hayes left after that Scientology episode.

So, when Tom came out about that, I’ve never seen someone get torn down so hard, and they still brutalize him with Scientology pieces to this day.
At around noon yesterday, The Atlantic posted an advertorial package for the Church of Scientology .
The promotional piece spoke of Scientology’s growth and the key role of the church’s “ecclesiastical leader,” David Miscavige.
Its timing was not curious, in that it hit the Atlantic site just days before the release of an exhaustive investigative book by the New Yorker’s Lawrence Wright on Scientology .
The lede of the piece was decidedly un-Atlantic: “2012 was a milestone year for Scientology, with the religion expanding to more than 10,000 Churches, Missions and affiliated groups, spanning 167 nations — figures that represent a growth rate 20 times that of a decade ago.
This is the first such package that The Atlantic has done with Scientology.

Powerful force-fields kept their souls  called  Thetans  in Scientology jargon  from escaping, and these thetans were then shown special holographic movies about the various lies they are supposed to believe, with characters like Jesus, Mohammed and Buddha.
The key idea of Scientology is to avoid tax officials and psychiatrists at all costs, while paying the church a large amount of money for special  counseling   called  auditing  in their jargon  to help you reach a special enlightened state called  Clear  where you telepathically communicate with these  thetans  clinging to you and force them out of your body, and rid yourself of evil Xenu s influence.
By the way, most Scientologists don t know this, like the Mystery Cults of the Greco-Roman world, Scientology doles it s doctrine out in tiny doses to it s new recruits, and tells the public next to nothing about what it believes.
The Church of Scientology takes advantage of the gullibility of the American people to make a tidy profit.
Interestingly, the solution to this  root cause  is usually paying lots of money to the Church of Scientology.
Scientologists have been rightly satirised in several TV programmes, films and computer games, for example the movementarian cult in The Simpsons or the hubologists in Fallout 2, but despite this Scientology is still attracting a steady stream of new converts.
In practice, Scientology is the exact opposite of what it teaches.
It claims to promote freedom of speech, but Scientology sues anyone who says anything bad about Scientology.
If Scientology got big, the people who get in their way would be killed.
The series exposed Scientology’s unquenchable thirst for cash donations, and it also exposed Sindy Fagen to the disconnection policy.
By going public in a newspaper story critical of the church, she had crossed a line that Scientology members know is a step too far.

Now their stories                  have prompted other former Scientology veterans to go public                  about physical and mental abuses they say they witnessed and                  endured.

Church of Scientology Australia.
A clear-sighted revelation, a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Looming Tower, the now-classic study of al-Qaeda’s 9 11 attack.
Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with current and former Scientologists—both famous and less well known—and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative ability to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology.
At the book’s center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant science-fiction writer L.
We learn about Scientology’s complicated cosmology and special language.
In Going Clear, Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of this constitutional protection.
Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observation, understanding, and shaping a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that reveals the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.
Ron Hubbard: his days as a prodigiously prolific writer of pulp fiction, his odd military career, the publication of his breakthrough self-help book Dianetics  1950 , and the influence, riches, and controversy that have followed since he founded the Church of Scientology in 1954.
For those aware of Scientology through its celebrity adherents  Tom Cruise and John Travolta are the best known  rather than its works, the sheer scope of the church’s influence and activities will prove jaw-dropping.
The church categorically denies all charges of Miscavige’s abuse” and “Cruise, through his attorney, denies that he ever retreated from his commitment to Scientology” .
Brings a clear-eyed, investigative fearlessness to Scientology .
Lawrence Wright bend over backward to be fair to Scientology.
Not to be read home alone on a stormy night: Going Clear, Lawrence Wright s scary book about Scientology and its influence.
Lawrence Wright’s enthralling account of Scientology’s rise brims with celebrity scandal.
Although, if you were familiar with Scientology, you might not be so surprised.
Many aren t familiar with Scientology, in part because the Scientologists have been relentless and devoted to stamping out dissent and negative portrayals of their religion  previous books on L.
Ron Hubbard, Scientology s founder ended up with the publisher abandoning the project due to law suits and the British publisher of this book, dropped it for fear of libel law suits  .
New Yorker writer Lawrence Wright, who is known as one of our great investigative journalists, has prepared himself by doing an incredible amount of due diligence and fact checking  apparently the fact checkers at the New Yorker, which first published an article on Scientology by Wright, made herculean efforts to make sure they got the facts right .
Wright portrays Scientology as in large part an expression of L.
Ron Hubbard s whimsy:  Even as Hubbard was inventing the doctrine, each of his decisions and actions would become enshrined in Scientology lore as something to be emulated -- his cigarette smoking, for instance, which is still a feature of the church s culture at the upper levels, as are his 1950s habits of speech, his casual misogyny, his aversion to perfume and scented deodorants, and his love of cars and motorcycles and Rolex watches.
Wright, however, does not create a simple portrayal of Hubbard and Scientology.
In a way Scientology is a truly modern religion in that it mixes a faux-scientific veneer  it s founder after all was a sci-fi writer  with a belief system and psycho-spiritual approaches.
I ve read another summary of Scientology - Wright s is far superior, and I especially like his detailing of the church s beliefs.
He traces Scientology from its origin in the imagination of science-fiction writer L.
The organization s major goal is recruiting new members, increasingly achieved via exploiting celebrities such as Tom Cruise, John Travolta - he credits Scientology with putting his career into high-gear , and enlisting young members into its Sea Organization clergy - often as young 10 - 12 year-old children signing up for billion-year contracts and work under poor conditions for little no payment  eg.
A billion years is but a temporary job in Scientology - they contend the world is already four quadrillion years old, and attaining immortality should certainly extend beyond one billion more years.
Obviously, something is suspect about the numbers, unless Scientology has an incredibly high and fast dropout rate.
Besides donations from members, Scientology also obtains the revenues from 1,000+ books written by Hubbard.
They re first led to a Scientology location where they re given  stress tests  with a quasi lie-detector  E-meter - again, adding to the  science  label  or personality inventories that entice them into paying for courses or auditing therapies that address problems most on their minds.
The second level is constantly pursued to boost its recruitment appeal and advance its causes such as attacks on psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry for their having spoken out against Scientology, and promotion of its theories of education and drug rehabilitation.
He defined Scientology s goals as creating a civilization without insanity, criminals, or war, where Man is free to rise to greater heights - this idealism appeals to the young.
One has to wonder why those imprisoned by Scientology didn t walk out and call police.
Could such an obnoxious person who made things up science-fiction style as he went along also serve as a credible founder of a  real  religion, and would a  real  religion treat members such as Scientology has?
Both this and Reitman s Inside Scientology: The Story of America s Most Secretive Religion are required reads for those interested in Scientology.
The Scientology website does not tell you the whole story.
This book not only follows the story of a prominent Scientologist that left after a long 34 years as a dedicated Scientologist, but also provides great insight into the founder of the organization, as well as the host of controversy that has followed Scientology since its founding.
If you re considering joining Scientology, I encourage you to not only read what they say about themselves on their website, but also read the neutral and critical perspectives of Scientology as well, including this book.
They wanted me to forget about my education and work for Scientology, since they view their religion as the most important thing in the whole world, of all time.
I was told by one staff member that studying for a graduate entrance exam was not as important as studying Scientology.
If you value your time, your education, and most importantly your money, do not join Scientology.
And really, the purported super powers of  Operating Thetans   the higher levels of the Scientology religion  are non-existent, even after the hundreds of thousands of dollars one spends to get to those levels  which includes getting rid of the spirits of deceased aliens that are attached to our bodies, that cause all of our problems, found at OT III, i.
Wright s overview of what a Suppressive Person is is important, especially as we see how Scientology is dealing with the release of this book.
He also covers Scientology s evolution from a  science of mental health  to a purported religion.
Of course no book on Scientology would be complete without discussing the two  first Clears , and how they didn t have the abilities Hubbard claimed Clears would have.
I also loved the discussion of life in the early Sea Org  Scientology s elite order of the most dedicated members, who sign billion-year contracts , as this is something that many of us are not familiar with.
I and many others that have been there have observed Scientology to not be what it claims, and that it will ruin your life, as they try to mold you into what they want, to serve their purposes.
It follows a five-year legal battle by Louisa Hodkin, a 25-year-old    scientologist, who was seeking the right to get married at the Church of    Scientology chapel in central London, which she attends.
That decision stemmed from a 1970 court case which excluded scientology    because it did not fit within the terms of the 1855 Places of Worship    Registration Act which counts only groups which revere a “deity” as true    religions.
During debates in 2006 Michael    Gove, now the education secretary, used Parliamentary privilege to describe    scientology as an “evil cult”.
In the face of concerns raised by Conservatives in Opposition, Labour Ministers told Parliament during the passage of the Equalities Bill that    Scientology would continue to fall outside the religious exemption for    business rates.
But we now discover Scientology may be eligible for rate relief and that the    taxpayer will have to pick up the bill, all thanks to Harriet Harman and    Labour s flawed laws.
Hard-pressed taxpayers will wonder why Scientology premises should now be    given tax cuts when local firms have to pay their fair share.
We ve all watched as interest in Scientology has skyrocketed this summer, and it seems to have reached some kind of culmination this week with Anderson s movie in theaters and Maureen Orth s story on the cover of Vanity Fair.
Next week will be my last as editor of the Voice; I will be leaving to pursue a book proposal about Scientology in its time of crisis.
Today at 6 pm, Scientology will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a building in Washington DC s Dupont Circle neighborhood.
For the last couple of years, Scientology has opened  Ideal Orgs  -- fancy, superfluous new churches in cities around the world in an expensive ploy to make it look like the church is expanding.
At a time when Scientology is reeling from several major crises and more negative press attention than ever in its history, the church is officially opening a  National Affairs Office  in the nation s capital, expecting that it can become a player in American politics.
The 27-year-old son of Scientology president Heber Jentzsch was found dead on the morning of July 3 at the home of his in-laws.
The son of the president of the Church of Scientology International, cut off by the church from both of his parents, was taking methadone while he had serious pneumonia rather than antibiotics.
Only this time it wasn t old man Potter providing the bullying tactics, but the attorneys of the Church of Scientology.
The Voice has obtained a remarkable document -- a letter from Scientology s attorneys which explains how the church would agree to forgive almost $43,000 in court costs if Marc and Claire Headley agree to turn over information about former Scientology executive Marty Rathbun and  others involved in disparaging  the church,  including any media contacts.
In a lengthy and detailed decision , federal appellate judge Diarmuid O Scannlain found that as longtime members of Scientology s hardcore  Sea Org,  the Headleys had certainly endured hardships -- Claire claimed that she had been forced to have two abortions in order to keep up with the Sea Org s 100-hour weeks while paid pennies an hour -- but Scientology had not violated human trafficking laws.
After that court victory, Scientology was entitled to court costs, and the Headleys received three bills totaling $42,852.
We managed to find a copy of the new Vanity Fair today, and we ve read Maureen Orth s story,  What Katie Didn t Know,  about Tom Cruise and his Scientology-approved search for a new wife.
The Voice received an e-mail this morning from Oscar-winning director Paul Haggis after we asked him about the Church of Scientology s attack on him and Nazanin Boniadi which appeared on Us Weekly s website yesterday.
Over the weekend, Haggis spoke up to defend Boniadi -- who acted in his movie The Next Three Days -- when she turned out to be the subject of this month s Vanity Fair in a story about her being one of several women who were  auditioned  in 2004 by Scientology to become the next girlfriend for Tom Cruise.
In 1955, Scientology founder L.
These celebrities not only gave the relatively small organization some luster, they were trained how to talk about Scientology -- in positive, but always very vague, terms -- and entertainment reporters knew not to pry.
But now, with Scientology going through several serious crises -- from flagging membership to investigations of deaths at its drug rehab centers -- the church s biggest problems are only being magnified because of the involvement of its celebrities.
Could its obsession with Hollywood stars ultimately hasten Scientology s demise?
One of Scientology s enduring mysteries is that it has attracted Hollywood stars when it has such a reputation for homophobia.
The sexual orientation of its top celebrities is always a matter of popular speculation, and even those with the barest understanding of Scientology seem to know that if celebrity members are gay, they have to keep quiet about it.
Now, we have a remarkable story about a man named Keith Relkin who for several years became a sort of unofficial spokesman for queer Scientology.
He was the church s token gay guy in West Hollywood, insisting to the public that Scientology was actually friendly to homosexuality.
Mike Napier, the captain of Scientology s private cruise ship, the Freewinds, stars in this film and tells us about the benefits of his  competence and leadership  course  which looks hard to distinguish from your typical Outward Bound sort of experience, but what do we know .
This is Scientology, so naturally the claims are off the charts -- for example, swabbing the decks of the church s tugboat is somehow going to teach you how not to age!

The first, born in 1911, leads disciples in the tens of thousands by founding a religion called Scientology.
DeWolf, 36, is one of Scientology’s harshest critics, a hero to the disbelievers who call the religion a cult.
Ron knew if you don’t have facts, all you need is faith, so he transformed his science into a religion, and Scientology was born.
Books are everywhere — true-crime novels, show biz studies, Scientology tomes stacked up not as bedside reading but as a nightstand.
He’s also appeared at “Anti-Scientology Summits” in Clearwater, Fla.
He helped with that family business for a while, but later told Penthouse magazine that “99% of anything my father ever wrote or said about himself is untrue,” and compared Scientology’s inner sanctum, the “Sea Org,” with the Hitler Youth.
At the time, his grandfather was wrestling with Scientology for control of Hubbard’s estate and eventually accepted an undisclosed court settlement.

David Miscavige, the chief of the Church of Scientology International, as Miscavige joined him and Cruise’s sister Lee Anne DeVette at the opening of the Madrid Scientology center, in September 2004.
Mike Rinder, the founding director of Scientology International and former head of the Office of Special Affairs, claims that the star had just said the same thing to him minutes before as they waited for Miscavige, who is referred to by Scientology honchos as C.
Miscavige, according to Rinder and Marty Rathbun, Scientology’s former inspector general and No.
They and the other sources in this article, virtually all of them on the record, have been dismissed by Scientology as disgruntled apostates and worse.
According to several of these on-the-record sources, Scientology more and more came to be whatever Miscavige said it was, and both Kidman and Cruz had been found wanting in their embrace of the organization and therefore unsuitable for the highly prized Cruise—Kidman especially.
It’s not like you only have to please your husband—you have to toe the line for all Scientology,” explains Marc Headley, a Scientologist from age seven, who tells me he watched a number of the dozens of three-to-four-minute audition videotapes when he was executive producer of Golden Era Productions, Scientology’s in-house studio.
You can’t do anything to displease Scientology, because Tom Cruise will freak out.
According to Headley’s wife, Claire, who grew up as a Scientology cadet and worked directly under the Miscaviges in the Religious Technology Center  R.
Scientology’s supreme headquarters, located outside the California desert town of Hemet, 80 miles southeast of Los Angeles, “They couldn’t find a woman to have the relationship with at a time when Cruise was talking about donating his excess millions to fund Scientology buildings.
There can be no underestimating how valuable Cruise was to Scientology.
He joined Scientology in 1986, when he was 24, and he credits its study methods with helping him overcome dyslexia.

In October 1993, during the first year of the Clinton administration, Scientology received its disputed status as a tax-exempt church.

Cruise appeared both in person and on a bizarre videotape—wearing a black turtleneck and extolling Scientology—that subsequently went up on the Internet.
Auditing is a very big deal in Scientology, its expensive version of Roman Catholic confession, administered by an auditor posing hundreds of questions to a paying subject holding on to two metal canisters wired to an Electropsychometer, or E-Meter, which measures the body’s reactions to the questions somewhat as a lie detector does.
III, or Wall of Fire, where one is allowed to read Scientology founder L.
Numerous sources say that Kidman, a Catholic, was never considered safe by Scientology, because her father, in Australia, is a psychologist, by definition a Suppressive Person, since Scientology rejects psychiatry and all psychotropic drugs.
According to Amy Scobee, a former director of Scientology’s Celebrity Centres for 10 years and a member of the Sea Org—the church’s version of clergy—as a result of Cruise’s purported drifting, one hapless woman involved with Kidman’s case was punished at Hemet by being made to wear a black “boiler suit”—a signal that no one at the R.
A Scientology representative disputes that such punishment took place.
Rathbun asserts, “I was spending 50 percent of my time during that three-year period just securing Tom into the Scientology camp.
Today, Rathbun states that disagreements over Scientology were at the heart of Cruise’s two previous divorces, from the actress Mimi Rogers, who was also a Scientologist, and from Kidman.
There were allegations and counter-allegations about fidelity, but the central problem was Nicole did not want to deal with Scientology,” he says.
Of Miscavige, Rathbun tells me, “I felt I used every tool I knew in the Scientology tool book to overcome Cruise’s weaknesses, and I saw Miscavige use those frailties and weaknesses in order to manipulate.
Miscavige eagerly awaited the Cruise reports and those of other high-profile Scientology members at his Gold Base headquarters, in Hemet.
He loved to dish about celebrities,” says Tom De Vocht, Miscavige’s former close aide, who went on to run Scientology’s large operation in Clearwater, Florida, where Scientologists from all over the world go to study.
Cruise himself was reportedly unable to entice a number of beautiful, well-known actresses—including Sofía Vergara and Scarlett Johansson—to accept his devotion to Scientology.
She had brought him into Scientology.
According to the knowledgeable source, a Scientology official asked what it would take to make her break off with him.
Once the paper was sent off for approval, accompanied by new photos showing dark hair and no braces, the knowledgeable source says, Boniadi was presented with a confidentiality agreement, which she didn’t even read to the end, though she was told that if she decided to leave without Scientology’s approval or “messed up” in any way she would be declared an S.
The next day, their first stop was in the theater district, at Scientology’s New York center.
According to the knowledgeable source, Boniadi was incredulous that Scientology would set her up.
But first, according to the knowledgeable source, Cruise and Wilhere took Boniadi on a tour of the Empire State Building, along with Tommy Davis, a top aide in Scientology, his then wife, Nadine, and the woman who would become his next wife, Jessica Rodriguez, as well as Cruise’s sister Lee Anne and her daughter, Lauren.
Despite the fact that her parents were deeply worried, she was allowed to tell them only that she was in New York on a special Scientology project, never that she was with Cruise.
This process started with the first words she ever spoke to him, “Very well done,” about his receiving Scientology’s Freedom Medal of Valor.
By late November, Boniadi felt even more isolated as she and Cruise flew to Telluride, along with the entourage, whose sole purpose, it seemed, was to keep Cruise happy and to let him know how much money he was bringing into the organization, how many people joined Scientology every day because of him, and how much he was doing to save the planet.
In Scientology, the ability to have your communication “land” is crucial.
She had been asked by a Scientology official to sleep alone, according to the source, but she cited the organization’s rule that in a loving relationship a couple does not go to sleep with unresolved issues.
Boniadi was then packed off to Scientology’s Mecca, the Flag building, in Clearwater, Florida, according to the source, where, thanks to the generosity of Cruise, she could get counseling and atone for her errors.
A Scientology spokesperson responds: “The Church does not ‘punish’ people, especially in  manner.
The ostracizing of Kidman within Scientology extended even to her movies, according to J.
The Scientology world hated Nicole.

Katie Holmes all over the TV studio before dragging her onstage, he was beginning to attract unwanted media attention to Scientology.
Moreover, the Internet was becoming a thorn in the side of Scientology, which strictly controlled what its hierarchy at Sea Org could access.
Normal education was minimized because of Scientology’s belief in reincarnation—everyone was already millions of years old.
Children of Sea Org members born into Scientology before the 1987 ban on those members’ having children went to what Scientologists call “Chinese school,” where they had to memorize long passages of L.
When I asked Mike Rinder, who for many years coordinated all responses to the media about Scientology, whether, when Scientologists had a baby, they immediately started saving for college, he just laughed and said, “No, I don’t think so.
On the 2004 video on which Miscavige presents Cruise with Scientology’s Freedom Medal of Valor, the two men salute first each other and then a portrait of L.
What really got Scientology’s goat, however, was the November airing on Comedy Central of a South Park spoof of Scientology, called “Trapped in the Closet,” in which a kid named Stan pays $240 for auditing and scores off the Bridge as an O.
According to an internal Scientology document that Rinder provided me with, the threatening message was very clear: “This is a twoway street.
Other documents include demands to try to kill pending Los Angeles Times and Rolling Stone stories on Scientology  both of which ran , as well as a proposed deal to kill an NBC Dateline piece planned on Scientology in exchange for an exclusive interview with Tom Cruise on another program.
Rinder estimates that he met 10 times during a five-year period with Cruise’s people to demand that they get unfavorable stories about Scientology killed.
On the Universal lot, Cruise had pulled strings to have a Scientology tent erected—against the studio’s policy of not having any outside groups present during filming.
At Holmes’s fairy-tale wedding, at Odescalchi Castle, in Italy, in 2006, David Miscavige did not officiate as the head of the Church of Scientology; rather, he was Cruise’s best man.
As TomKat flooded the tabloids in 2005, Marc Headley, who had started working for Life & Style Weekly as a Scientology expert, heard that the editors had a source who said that Martin Holmes, a Catholic and a divorce lawyer in Toledo, Ohio, wanted to know how his daughter could escape Scientology’s clutches.
Headley’s advice was to speak out publicly against Scientology and be labeled a Suppressive Person so that his daughter would have to choose between him and Cruise.
When Headley published his book, Blown for Good: Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology, about his split from the organization, in 2010, he sent a copy to Holmes at his law firm.
Given his long commitment to Scientology and the demands of his career, Cruise has very little wiggle room.
Nevertheless, many Scientology mothers I spoke to warn that although Holmes has won a battle she has not necessarily won the war.
According to Scientology doctrine,” says Samantha Domingo, who was formerly married to Placido Domingo Jr.
She warns, “If he loves his daughter, he will never give up .
Furthermore, though he is his church’s putative savior, he has probably brought more invasive attention to Scientology than anyone else.
Saint Hill is the last great bastion of Scientology in the UK.
His decision to turn it into Scientology’s British head office made it a Mecca for followers of Hubbard’s philosophy, of which there are now said to be 10 million  this number is disputed by basically anyone who isn’t a signed up Scientologist .
Atack, who has repeatedly challenged the membership figures posited by Scientology’s top brass, told me, “Scientology was never big business in the UK.
But Saint Hill used to be the bustling international headquarters of Scientology.
East Grinstead might prefer visitors to focus on attractions like its beautiful 14th century timber high street, or the local coffee shop owned by Peter Andre, but it was better known for years as the UK base of Scientology, Mormonism, Opus Dei, and Rosicrucianism.
In the last decade they’ve opened both a major church near St Paul’s Cathedral and the Dianetics and Scientology Life Improvement Center on Tottenham Court Road.

This is the test that the Church of Scientology uses to determine whether you can be saved by their purification schemes, or whether you’re insufficiently pro-discipline.
One of those websites is “Operation Clambake,” an anti-Scientology organization so widely followed that it even has its own Wikipedia page.
I spoke to its founder, Norwegian activist Andreas Heldal-Lund, to ask him why he thinks Scientology has failed in the UK.
And that, he believes, is where Scientology has shot itself in the foot.
Despite what Atack and Heldal-Lund have told me, and the dismal emptiness of the Scientology venues I’ve visited in the UK, I can t help but feel sorry for Britain s Scientologists.
They filled out the personality test, discovered they were pathetic mortals, and were told that the only way to rebuild themselves was through Scientology.
Saint Hill might present itself as the headquarters of Scientology in the UK, but that clearly doesn t count for much.
As for the old guard of British operations, most—including Irene Thrupp—have died, taking Scientology to the grave with them.
The Scientology image campaign is looking for fresher faces than celebs like John Travolta  l.
Sorry, Tom Cruise and John Travolta — the Church of Scientology is on the lookout for new “normal” faces.
Should the Church of Scientology decide to go with a more famous face, they have plenty from which to choose.

Highest ecclesiastical officer of scientology’s ‘mother church’  church of scientology international .
Long-time Scientology Executive Strata member – the alleged highest management body in church of scientology international.
She is a close personal aide to David Miscavige – the self-proclaimed pope of scientology.
Because of scientology’s bunker down response to public exposure of Miscavige’s creation of a culture of violence at the highest levels of scientology, including maintenance of concentration and torture prisons, people have been in mystery as to what scientology management has been up to for the past several years.
It is remarkable in that Miscavige has spent millions of dollars to create a wall of perjury before Texas courts claiming that he, and the highest levels of scientology management, have no knowledge – and have not authorized – these same type of ambush, in-your-face tactics against me and my family that have been carried out for years now.
They insist that with conscious aforethought he created and operated dianetics and scientology as a fraudulent bait and switch operation fooling and fleecing tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of relatively intelligent adults.
The anti-scientologist with his name-calling, absolutist statements and lampooning serves to reinforce the scientologist believer’s conviction that Hubbard and scientology deserve undaunting and vigilant defense.
Members of either side of the scientology extremes demonstrate as severe a case of denialism as the other.
It seems that in the scientology world L.
One won’t find much truth on either side of a passionate debate between denialists, whether the subject is politics, science, philosophy or scientology.
We will explore the reasons why those affected by scientology in the long-term continue to act out scientology’s patented us vs.
It is quite easy to understand why someone gets involved in scientology in the first place.
What is so unique about scientology is not that it at first capitalizes on this adolescent growth stage and its needs.
Instead, it is that scientology manages to implant within the scientologist’s sub conscious that this stage is as far as development goes.
The closed culture of scientology makes stage growth stunting inevitable.
That culture convinces the individual to assign any and every personal development along the Fowler schema  — or by any other standard — to the brilliance of Hubbard and scientology.
Likewise, it includes sophisticated and complex analyses for blaming any regression or depression on perceived enemies of scientology, directly or indirectly.
All of these dichotomy creating mis-assignment of causation devices serve to reinforce the adolescent, denialist universe view taught in scientology.
The adolescent stage of faith universe view is so thoroughly ingrained in the sub conscious of the scientologist that even when an individual manages to disconnect from the scientology organization he or she often continues to act with the adopted us vs.
The former cult member can gravitate toward groups of independent, former, and even anti-scientologists who act in the same cliquish and cruel manner that they did while actively participating in scientology.
In the scientology milieu – organizational, independent, former, and anti – reason holds little currency.
Getting out of the scientology sandbox begins with one simple, liberating step.
But, for the reasons outlined thus far, it is a step those involved in scientology culture find difficult to navigate.
TNT, you have nothing on scientology.
Most of this essay was drafted prior to me seeing this latest scientology, well, drama.
And like any good drama, the scientology one includes its nemeses.
They are programmed to destroy, wittingly or not, humankind’s only hope for furlough, scientology.
Some classes of people do not even have to demonstrate that they have even heard the word ‘scientology’ to be considered suppressive people by scientologists.
Psychs is a scientology term describing anyone involved in the mental health, mind science, or psychotherapy fields.
Psychs are overtly targeted for ‘annihilation’, ‘obliteration’ and ‘extinction’ by scientology.
A couple years later Tom Cruise invited Brooke Shields and her husband to his scientology wedding to Katie Holmes in Italy so that she could see first-hand those who really know about the mind.
Tom’s hand-picked high-level scientology officiating minister was Commander Norman F.
Starkey was given a furlough from a scientology concentration and torture camp at which he was serving time in order to conduct the wedding.
She and her husband were so offended, they complained to Cruise’s best man, scientology supreme leader David Miscavige.
Thus, along with the deep past, identity – or ego –  is made an obsession with scientology.
The original client-centered therapy that scientology copied and scientology itself – up to the level of Clear – aim for stripping those ‘false’ identities one tends to collect and adopt so as to reach a state of self-actualization where a person finds his own self.
However,  in scientology one is not permitted to take that self-actualization so as to transcend self and explore new horizons.
Instead, scientology teaches that knowing oneself is not good enough; one must become someone else: the superhuman, ubermensch, operating thetan.
In fact, unwilling to admit the failure of scientology to erase the subconscious, Hubbard came up with a new explanation for the continuing subconscious dramas Clears continue to play out.
More fundamentally,  scientology’s tenet of the everlasting individuality makes Clear self-actualizing a minor way station.
To believe that scientology has secrets in store that will release the self from this obsession with time and identity would be irrational.
For the past twenty-eight years scientology’s leaders have been attempting to read Hubbard’s solo  self-administered meditations  sessions after his own passage through his highest published level.
Years later David Miscavige – who later deposed Broeker -pulled the same stunt in a special “OT Summit” briefing aboard scientology’s ship the Freewinds.
So, the only thing the world knows about scientology’s as yet uncodified levels is that they direct attention to dates in the past that are so ancient the numbers alone can fill a foolscap sheet of paper.
Lest people mistake that worship of the past is something David Miscavige and Pat Broeker misinterpreted from Hubbard’s final days, realize it is much the same in scientology circles outside of the official organization.
While Miscavige and Broeker promised OT levels IX, X, and ‘so on’, the leading independent scientology organization offers fifty-five  55  such levels beyond Clear – or four and one half times the invitations to regress yet further into the past.
Once sold on the reactive mind construct as fact, the next most fundamental belief instilled through the scientology catechism is that we have all fallen from grace and must strive to re-attain it.
Thus, the central practice of scientology is a form of abreaction therapy that returns one to and addresses each step one took down the ladder from his native condition.
Unlike more conventional psychotherapies, scientology’s abreaction practice is intended to be, and is in practice, interminable.
That is due to scientology also teaching that each of us is a positive, separate identity that has been intact for quadrillions of years and beyond.
Consequently, the second important prong of the scientology indoctrination is the belief that the answers to the mysteries of the universe all lay deep in the past.
As much as scientology promises to create freedom from the past – and irrespective of how personally liberating one finds certain  instances of regressing back to face it might be – scientology never releases the adherent from it.
To the contrary, scientology continues to offer indoctrination at its highest levels that enforces a fixation yet deeper into the past.
Yet, the words of scientology’s founder L.
And so scientology ultimately becomes an insulated cult playing out an exaggerated form of that which it is taught to condemn.
In practice this is how scientology culture operates.
And therein lies the most troubling aspect of scientology’s enforced information bubble.
There is a specific sector of scientology ‘technology’ that clearly betrays the subject’s hypnotic, mind controlling nature.
In short, Hubbard dictates that one identify the source of any data that is getting in the road of a person adopting, with 100% certainty and exclusivity, any datum from scientology’s indoctrination.
Because, in scientology there is only one way, and that is the way Ron Hubbard tells you it is.
This bulletin, and ‘technology’, was not developed because of any scientology counseling problems being encountered.
Fittingly, scientology’s chief justification for the operation was to ‘correct false data in government files.
What ‘false data’ do you suppose all outposts of the scientology network were fixated on ‘stripping’ about that time?
The true scientology data is that if someone fails it is more likely that they are secretly engaged in criminal activity and have billions year old hidden evil intentions towards Ron and scientology, and that any failure should be interrogated intensively to uncover such.
The true scientology data is that it is far more effective, and necessary, to ‘muster bayonets’ as most people are ‘degraded beings’ and it is fruitful sometimes to ‘make Captain Bligh look like a Sunday school teacher.
So thorough is Hubbard’s ‘tech’ for ferreting out and disappearing ‘false data’ that conflicts with his data, ironically, that those steps applied to one’s scientology experience could actually de-hypnotize someone from years of mind control programming.
Borne out of this desire to help are the many social    betterment activities Scientology supports.
Before Scientology, my problems looked gigantic.
You can worry about something for years, or you can handle it in a few weeks with Scientology training.
While on the Purif I was able to see exactly how Scientology can help me be the person I have always wanted to be - myself.
How Do I Learn About Scientology?
Get the answer to the question What is Scientology?
Hubbard recorded his breakthroughs in Scientology and Dianetics books , essays and recorded lectures.
When you read a Scientology book, such as Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought , look at your own life and see if what you have read applies to it.
Ron Hubbard dealing with Scientology or Dianetics principles.
How is the Church of Scientology organized?
Church of Scientology International  CSI , the mother church of the Scientology religion, is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.
CSI oversees the ecclesiastical activities of all Scientology Churches, organizations and groups world over and ensures that individual Churches receive guidance in their ministries.
In Scientology, the concept of God is expressed as the Eighth Dynamicâ€”the urge toward existence as infinity.
As the Eighth Dynamic, the Scientology concept of God rests at the very apex of universal survival.
Scientology Sunday service, offered at all Scientology churches is a unique, lively interactive experience, where you will gain practical knowledge of Scientology            principles you can apply to life immediately.
Scientology church staff are there to answer your questions, help you work out what Scientology service is best for you, and get you started on your way to greater self            confidence, happiness and awareness.
Why do so many people turn to Scientology for answers?
Because Scientology technology contains answers that work.
The staff at Scientology churches understand that when someone is beset with worries like these, they will find it hard to appreciate the tremendous potential for increased spiritual awareness and freedom that is available through Scientology training and counseling.
How does Scientology view that?
Ron Hubbardâ€™s Scientology research led him right into the problem of handling the effects of drugs when he discovered that drugs actually prevent spiritual gain.
Because Scientology deals with basic truths about life, when people study Scientology technology, they gain skill in living!
But what if I have too much trouble studying to take a Scientology course?
How can Scientology training help me?
Hubbard ran into this very problem when trying to train professional Scientology auditors, and this led him to researching the subject of study itself.
He discovered an actual technology of study, and this is taught at Scientology churches.
Why is the Scientology religion called an applied religious philosophy?

Years after leaving the Church of Scientology, Oscar-winning writer and director Paul Haggis is still as disturbed as ever about the way those who leave the church are treated.
During a conversation with HuffPost Live s Ricky Camilleri about his new film  Third Person,  Haggis discussed his break with Scientology , which was first explored at length in a 2011 New Yorker profile.
Haggis told HuffPost Live that the powers-that-be in the church want anyone who defects to do so quietly, and those who speak about it publicly face extreme bullying and intimidation from Scientology officials.
Because they are discovering that the true nature of Scientology is not what they thought it was.
Behind the glittering façade, Scientology is rotten at its core.
There are now thousands of these insider accounts online, and dozens of books written by journalists and by ex-Scientologists, including my own account of life inside Scientology, Counterfeit Dreams: One Man’s Journey Into and Out of the World of Scientology.
I started this site in July 2009 as a resource for people who wanted to leave Scientology, and needed information, assistance, or just a friendly ear.
I wanted to provide a central place where people could find insider information about the Church of Scientology, where they could peek “behind the curtain” and see what was really going on, and where they could begin to understand the lies and mental manipulation that has been used to keep them from questioning the Church of Scientology.
I have also published the key essays from this site as an e-book, Leaving Scientology: A Practical Guide to Escape and Recovery , which is intended to assist anyone leaving the Church.
This site will continue as a resource for those who are leaving Scientology.
As always, I remain available for anyone needing assistance in leaving Scientology, and I can be reached at rebel008@hushmail.

Welcome to the Introduction to Scientology World Wide Web page.
Designed to present a critical but open-minded viewpoint, this page is for the curious and the uninformed: those who have heard about Scientology  and who wish to seek additional information about Dianetics , its founder L.
Perhaps you ve read about Scientology in one of the many fancy publications of the Church of Scientology, or perhaps you ve learned about the war between Scientology and the Internet in a magazine, newspaper, or Webzine.
You may be curious about Scientology because some of its members are famous celebrities, including John Travolta, Tom Cruise, Jenna Elfman, Isaac Hayes, and others.
Cruise in particular has become more and more vocal in his criticism of psychiatry and psychiatrists, based upon his Scientology beliefs.
Perhaps you read Usenet , and you heard about Scientology from your favorite newsgroup.
The links provided on this Web page will provide you with all the information you ever wanted to know about Scientology and its war against the Internet.
Since the foundation of this Web site, I have occasionally received emails stating that I am biased against Scientology.
I believe that Scientology is such a volatile, controversial, and polarizing subject that it is impossible to remain unbiased after you have experienced its actions first-hand.
However, regardless of what I may think of Scientology, I have taken pains to make sure that the information presented here contains nothing but the truth.
It is my hope that after you read these pages, you will want to become active in the struggle between Scientology and the Internet.
Created in 1991 in the wake of the Time magazine cover story about Scientology, the newsgroup alt.
It started here on the newsgroup, and the newsgroup continues to be the source of many of the most startling revelations about Scientology, with new bulletins appearing almost every day.
The simple act of discussing Scientology here on the Net can lead to a lot of unwanted trouble, and this may scare some people away.
This is exactly what the Church of Scientology wants.
Read it, and learn what you can do to help others and help yourself, and participate  safely  in the war between Scientology and the Internet.
UPDATE # 2: Yahoo News has received a statement from the Church of Scientology, refuting the ABC News and Village Voice reports.
The Church of Scientology statement is included at the bottom of this post.
But Valeska Paris says she was held against her will aboard the Scientology cruise ship   Freewinds   for more than a decade.
In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation s  ABC News  Lateline program , Paris claims that Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige sent her to the ship when she was 18 in order to prevent her family from pulling her out of the organization.
Paris was born into a Scientology family, but her mother quit the group after her husband committed suicide, blaming Scientology for coercing him out of a self-made personal fortune of more than a million dollars.
Instead of the promised two week stay, Paris found herself unable to leave the ship without an official Scientology escort and was often forced into hard labor on the lower levels of the ship for stretches as long as two full days.
So it s a bit hard  and by that time I was 18, I d been in Scientology my whole life, it s not like I knew how to escape,  she said.
The Church of Scientology calls Paris  claims false but declined ABC requests to make church officials available for interviews for the story.
In a statement, the Church of Scientology said Ms Paris  claims were false.
The Church of Scientology has released a statement to Yahoo!
She was there of her own free will as part of her religious commitment to the Church of Scientology.
A new Scientology release form has surfaced that gives the cult the right to hold its members in isolation indefinitely, and absolves it of any responsibility for a member s injury or death as a result -- the  Lisa McPherson clause .
Thanks to Scientology PR spokesperson Linda Simmons Hight for confirming the document s authenticity to Fox News.
In 1997, Lisa s estate filed a wrongful death suit against the Church of Scientology.
That trial has been postponed six times by Scientology s legal maneuvering, but is now expected to take place in 2004.
Before and after the wrongful death case was filed by Lisa s family, attorneys for Scientology insisted to state prosecutors -- and on national television -- that there was no religious service involved in Lisa s treatment; she was simply a guest at the Fort Harrison Hotel   Flag   enjoying  rest and relaxation.
The state of Florida brought criminal charges against the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization in 1998 for its treatment of Lisa McPherson.
This occurred after Scientology spent months harassing Wood.
Prior to the dropping of charges, Scientology filed a Motion to Dismiss the criminal charges in which it asserted that  The Introspection Rundown itself is an entirely religious process.
Seen in historical context, the Introspection Rundown is the culmination of pseudo-psychiatric and pseudo-medical therapies that dates back to the founding of Dianetics and runs through Scientology up to the present day.
Hubbard s stated secular intention was to eliminate psychiatry, and Lisa McPherson fell victim to an organization, Scientology s Flag Service Org, whose members were following Scientology policy.
Dandar as counsel for the estate, Scientology again argued that it had the legal right to hold Lisa McPherson against her will and deny her access to medical care and contact with her friends and family, because she was a parishioner, and Lisa s treatment was a  religious practice .
Parishioners seeking services at Flag -- the place Scientology advertises as the  Mecca of Technical Perfection  -- must sign a contract promising not to sue if they are harmed.
The Case Supervisor will determine the time period in which I will remain isolated, according to the beliefs and practices of the Scientology religion.
Tory Christman, who spent 30 years in Scientology before quitting in disgust, confirms that the first such waivers were instituted right after Lisa s death.
Rather than assure its members that it would never repeat the horrors of what happened to Lisa McPherson, what Scientology is saying in this release form is:  We were not wrong to hold Lisa against her will and deprive her of medical attention and leave her to die.
Clearly, Scientology s private position is that their mistake wasn t in killing Lisa McPherson; it was in not having a signed release form saying it was okay to do so.
This contrasts with the proposal Scientology leader David Miscavige tried to negotiate with the Florida State Attorney , Bernie McCabe, under which Scientology would take steps to ensure that its members receive appropriate medical treatment in the future if McCabe dropped the criminal charges in the McPherson case.
McCabe s scathing rejection of this offer questioned why Scientology has not already taken these steps.
To make it perfectly clear: Scientology is not against professional medical care, provided that the care is not of a psychiatric nature.
But with this form, Scientology is saying it has the right to kidnap and hold a mentally disturbed member at any time, because, in the words of one ex-member,  If THEY say you re crazy, then you are, and you have already agreed that they can kidnap you and hold you against your will if they deem you to be crazy.
And although Scientology claims its treatment is purely spiritual, its staff have no qualms about dressing up in nurses uniforms   pic1 , pic2 , pic3   to lure the public into taking a  stress test  on the E-meter or purchasing copies of Dianetics.
The main use for this release form may be for bullying doctors into relinquishing custody of patients who have been taken in for psychiatric evaluation, and are perhaps facing involuntary committment, just as Scientology bullied the staff at Morton Plant Hospital where Lisa was taken and coerced them into releasing her into their custody, despite the report from paramedics of her bizarre behavior and request for assistance.
Among the evidence obtained during discovery in the McPherson case is a collection of Lisa s PC  preclear  folders, which detailed her treatment at the hands of Scientology.
In order to frustrate similar discovery actions in the future, Scientology has issued another new release form , ostensibly concerned with preserving the confidentiality of parishioner files.
Scientology s position is that not only does it have a religious right to abuse its members, but it also has the right to withhold the written evidence of that abuse, even if the member has been killed as a direct result of Scientology s actions.
Thus, Scientology tries to perfect its ability to both commit and cover up future crimes.
Other cases include Gitte Mogensen  1996 , Heidi Degro  1993 , Cat Morrow  1980s , Marianne Coenan  1989 , David Voorhies  1983 , and a German national held at Scientology s U.

It is a stronghold of Scientology, so you should expect Scientologists there all the time.
There is no comparing Scientology to other “religions”.

Hate is a virtue in Scientology.
After 18 months of Scientology watching, the absurdity is still shocking to me.
Is it me or does everyone in Scientology just need some love to wipe away some of the oozing, bitter, nastiness?
And in Scientology, it could mean “end cycle” — in other words, commit suicide.
If they had done something like that, they would have helped Scientology legally, instead of shooting five toes off each of their own feet.

To any person unfamiliar with Scientology asking what it is, it would be sufficient to show him her this little video.
I wonder: is this the final product of scientology or sociopathic programming or both?
Did you turn to the passengers watching and say “this is what the Church of Scientology produces today!
David Miscavige must be so proud of these people, some of the highest ranking “executives” in the Church of Scientology.
People need to wake up to what Scientology can actually do to a person.
Amazing how much what he says seems to overlap with scientology too, but with a different approach, and I’m guessing it overlaps with Spiritologie as well.

This video certainly did have an effect on me…now I am 100% sure  as opposed to 95% prior  that Scientology is nothing more than a cult whose major skill set is the ability to manipulate and control people.

Pronouncing Scientologists guilty of the practice of standard Scientology.
Writing anti-Scientology letters to the press or giving anti-Scientology or anti-Scientologist evidence to the press.
If this video isn’t handing anti Scientology material to the press what is?
Acts calculated to misuse, invalidate or alter-is legally or in any other way the trademarks and service marks of Dianetics and Scientology.
Engaging in malicious rumor mongering to destroy the authority or repute of higher officers or the leading names of Scientology or to “safeguard” a position.
Severe breach of ecclesiastical and or fiduciary duty as an executive or corporate official of any Scientology or Dianetics organization which has resulted in severe harm, loss or disrepute for Scientology or the organization.
There is no policy in Scientology that requires Church members to disconnect from anyone, let alone family and friends who simply have different beliefs.
To the contrary, the moral code of Scientology mandates that Scientologists respect the religious beliefs of others.
And the comments clearly show that people are getting the message: Scientology is a vicious totalitarian brainwashing cult and something needs to be done about it.
Besides the week long Anderson Cooper series on “Scientology: A History of Violence”, this was probably one of the most effective events to inoculate the world against Scientology I have ever seen.
The problem in the Scientology culture, is this chronic suppression of the “only ones”.
This is exactly what has delivered Scientology upon the doorstep of mediocrity and ridicule.
There is a reason her mother got involved in Scientology.
There is a reason Jenny got introduced to Scientology in the first place.
Church of Scientology miscreatants….
I have been helped very well by the tech and the auditors in Scientology.
But it gives me no pleasure to know my joy later on in Scientology, came at the expense of others.
I was very careful in Scientology, to know that I did not make others hurt like I had been hurt, for disagreements.
I was 14 for saying, “I asked the neighbor what Scientology was, and he said it was “a crutch”.
Everything I was beat up for in Scientology and the Sea Org, my track, was because of the way I had to live as a result of not understanding Scientology and being connected to a person who thought Scientology would define them.
To showcase this dark side of humanity that is a thread woven into this fabric called Scientology.
He has altered Scientology not with malice, but with compassion.
Jenny is the embodiment of all that is wrong with scientology as an organization.
I found it to be a perfect antidote to Scientology’s OT insanity and a perfect wrap-up for its more enlightened views.
Well Marty, now again we can all see what the long term exposure to Scientology’s indoctrination produces on its followers: religious mania and a state of overwhelm.
Interestingly Claire commented that she thought having done the OT levels made her more susceptible to Scientology’s control than Marc, her husband, as well as being raised and educated within the SO.
Best wishes and prompt recovery from Scientology.
Your video proves the unchanged Scientology officials mindset status quo is still the creepy brainwashed motif.
I am a senior executive of the Church of Scientology International.
France s highest court on Wednesday upheld several convictions for  organized fraud  against the Church of Scientology.
The Cour de Cassation in Paris, France s highest appeals court, on Wednesday rejected an appeal by the Church of Scientology against several convictions for  organized fraud .
In 2009, convictions and fines of €400,000 and €200,000  $812,000 in total  were handed down to the Church’s Celebrity Centre and a Scientology bookshop in the French capital.
This isn’t the first time the Church of Scientology has been touched by scandal in France.
In 1996, Jean-Jacques Mazier, leader of the Lyon branch of the Church, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for fraud and involuntary homicide after Church member Patrice Vic committed suicide after going into debt to pay for Scientology auditing sessions.
In 2008 Kaja Bordevich Ballo, a Norwegian student living in Nice, killed herself after receiving the results of a negative Scientology personality test.
In France alone the Church of Scientology counts some 45,000 followers, and 10 million worldwide.
In 2009, Paul Haggis, the screenwriter-director who won an Oscar for 2005’s Crash and wrote Million Dollar Baby, publicly broke with the Church of Scientology.
While high-ranking officers in Scientology have defected from the controversial organization, Haggis at the time was by far the most famous to disavow it.
He publicly criticized Scientology for requiring members to “disconnect” from those who have left the church -- a practice it denies exists -- and for publishing personal information about defectors on websites with domains beginning “who is,” as in “Who Is Paul Haggis?
Having witnessed Scientology’s smear tactics, I can imagine how this was being orchestrated, but I was still shocked to see how quickly those friends -- some of whom had known Leah for 20 or 30 years -- jumped on the “malign Leah” campaign, and with such apparent glee.
I assumed Scientology’s next step would be to try and plant disparaging stories about her with less-informed journalists and bloggers.
And if others who have made noisy exits from the church are to be believed, Scientology would also use their Office of Special Affairs employees to attack Leah indirectly, posting negative comments about her shows and career and abilities under myriad false names, pretending to be disappointed fans or whatever.
What was new to me was the report that Leah had run afoul of the church by challenging Scientology’s leader, David Miscavige, who is held to be infallible.
When I was leaving and was visited by waves of angry friends and a phalange of top Scientology executives, trying to convince me to tear up my letter and resign quietly, I made a similar mistake by insisting they look into the charges of abuse detailed by the Tampa Bay Times.
I also have to confess to not paying that much attention to news about Scientology.
I will leave it to you to decide if the same can be said of Scientology’s executives and Leah’s many former friends -- especially those Scientologists who are watching her be smeared now and are choosing to stay silent.
In place of the content that recounted the opening of 12 new Scientology churches around the world, there is now a message that reads , “We have temporarily suspended this advertising campaign pending a review of our policies that govern sponsor content and subsequent comment threads.
The sponsored page carried a Scientology banner ad across the top and linked to two stories on the Scientology website.
The content, headlined “David Miscavige Leads Scientology to Milestone Year,” is labeled “Sponsor Content.
Disclosure: The Poynter-owned Tampa Bay Times has published multiple investigations of Scientology, which has headquarters in nearby Clearwater, Fla.
Not to compare the Scientology cult with the cult of Hitler, but there are similariries in terms of propaganda, the big lie, and disappearing former members , no?
RE:  raincoaster said — ”When I got comment-bombed with pro-Scientology comments, I did a little investigation and they were all made from the same IP, which traced to a building in downtown Vancouver with the same address as the Scientology center.

That is the reason why Anonymous is so far up Corporate Scientology’s butt right now because of their unwillingness to ALLOW free speech.
Julie, you should note that Louanne is one of the most prolific Scientology shills on the Internet, by the way.
Google “scientology louanne”  without the quotes  and see what happens.
The Atlantic can refund the cult’s money  or not  and that would be the end of it; litigation against the site for suppressing the cult’s right to “free speech” would end badly for Scientology, but at least the rest of the world would reap lots of laughs as you shoot yourselves in the foot yet again.
The Scientology advertorial was absolutely identical to the standard story layout.
Ron Hubbard’s controversial Church of Scientology was protected by a veil of mystery sustained equally by the church’s secretive practices and its reputation for terrorizing critics and defectors through lawsuits, harassment, and psychological warfare.
Scientology received another devastating blow in February 2011, when The New Yorker published “ The Apostate ,” Lawrence Wright’s riveting exploration of how Oscar-winning filmmaker Paul Haggis defected from Scientology in 2009 over the church’s long history of institutionalized homophobia.
Now Wright, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his 9 11 book The Looming Tower, has expanded that profile into Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, & The Prison Of Belief, a point-by-point deconstruction of Scientology’s core tenets.
Haggis prides himself on being socially and politically engaged, yet for decades, he willfully blinded himself to Scientology’s civil-rights abuses, bullying, and history of contorting facts to suit its purposes.
Haggis stuck with Scientology throughout the decades because it worked for him.
He depicts two Hubbards: One is the genius and prophet of Scientology lore, who figured out the mysteries of the ages via a peerless understanding of the human condition.
Going Clear splits the difference between these two competing, overlapping narratives, depicting Hubbard as an eccentric genius who was brilliant but arrogant, a pathological liar blessed with a world-class imagination and the energy and will to create his own religion out of bits and pieces purloined from Buddhism, New Age, self-help guides, and the psychotherapy he considered one of the great evils in the universe, in no small part because it posed such a threat to Scientology.
Where Hubbard ruled through charm, seduction, and canny manipulation, David Miscavige, his successor as the head of Scientology, rules through terror and brute force.
Wright peppers the footnotes with so many Scientology denials, they almost become a deadpan running joke.
In Wright’s telling, Miscavige led Scientology into a new golden age of abuse, abduction, and intimidation, as both rank-and-file membership and upper-church management were subject to Miscavige’s whims; those who displeased him wound up in brutal work camps as part of the sect’s Rehabilitation Project Force.
Celebrities understandably gravitated to a new faith that actively courted them while promising gifts beyond wealth and fame, but the church’s intense affiliation with famous figures proved problematic when those carefully cultivated celebrities began malfunctioning, from John Travolta’s passion project Battlefield Earth becoming an international laughing stock to Cruise transforming himself from one of Scientology’s greatest assets to one of its greatest liabilities with his controversial, eccentric behavior.
Scientology’s emphasis on celebrity acolytes makes it unusually vulnerable to celebrity defectors; the same power, prestige, and visibility that made Haggis a prize for Scientology also let him launch an attack on the church that falls somewhere between devastating and an outright death blow.
His case against Scientology is strong enough that he doesn’t have to keep piling on: The facts speak for themselves, particularly the endless accounts of ex-Scientologists who were emotionally and physically abused and run ragged by the church, then shunned and humiliated when they found the courage to leave.
Wright takes Scientology seriously as a new religion and as a philosophy.
In a bid for objectivity, he contextualizes some of the hostility and skepticism greeting Scientology as a result of the church’s newness: It lacks the authority and moral weight that comes with being passed down through centuries or millennia.
In accessible, straightforward prose that does a fine job of rendering Scientology’s sometimes convoluted core concepts understandable, Wright captures its horrors and abuses, but also the seductive glamour.

SAN ANTONIO -- In a decisive legal victory for David Miscavige, the controversial leader of the Church of Scientology, the Third Court of Appeals in Austin ruled Thursday that he does not have to come to Texas to be deposed in a high profile civil suit pending in Comal County.
The prospect of Miscavige, who is based in California, having to testify under oath had made the Texas case the focus of fevered attention of Scientology dissidents around the country and beyond.
The Volunteer Ministers program was launched more than 30 years ago, in response to an appeal by Scientology Founder L.
After a years long legal battle, federal prosecutors in Belgium now believe their investigation is complete enough to charge the Church of Scientology and its leaders as a criminal organization on charges of extortion, fraud, privacy breaches, and the illegal practice of medicine.
The matter ended up on the desk of examining magistrate Michel Claise, who ordered raids on Church of Scientology premises in 2008.
Multiple reports and the group s legal history point to one key factor here: The Belgian government won t charge Scientology for being a cult — authorities are focusing on prosecuting it as a criminal organization.
The Church of Scientology houses its European headquarters in Brussels, so a ban in Belgium could be crippling to the group — and authorities there seem to know it.
One of the more similar recent cases against came in 2009, when the French chapter of Scientology was convicted of fraud by a Paris court and fined nearly $900,000.
Neither the federal prosecution nor the Church of Scientology have made public comments since word of the impending charges surfaced early Friday.

Welcome to the Church of Scientology of Washington State.
Hubbard’s vision that all Churches of Scientology become what he termed Ideal Organizations  Orgs .
In Scientology, that search has culminated—for the secret has now been discovered.
And with exact Scientology techniques, you’ll discover them for yourself.
Because Scientology is the knowledge of you.
But when I next decided to expose a then relatively unknown organization   called Scientology  and the related Dianetics     I ended up falsely arrested and facing 15 years in jail, had 19 lawsuits filed   against me all over the world by Scientology, was the almost victim of a near   murder, was the subject of 5 disgusting anonymous smear letters sent to my   family and neighbors about me, and endured constant and continual harassment for   almost 15 years.
I started by writing an article exposing Scientology for   the British Harper Queen,  now Harper s Bazaar  and expanded this into   a book.
In it, among other things, I stated that the crux of Scientology their   e-meter which they say acts like a lie detector produced questionable results;   that Hubbard had lied about his credentials; that Charles Manson had called   himself a Scientologist; that some auditors had behaved improperly toward their  parishioners ; that some who left may have feared being blackmailed; that some   defectors claimed that they had been psychologically damaged by Scientology,   financially ripped-off, and or harassed when they tried to leave or speak out.
Gordon III, told   me that if this Grand Jury decided that I had sent Scientology the 2 bomb   threats, I faced 5 years in jail for each letter, 5 more for perjury for denying   it, and  $15,000 in fines.
I then rightly explained that Scientology could have   obtained a blank piece of paper that I had touched, and typed threats on it   afterwards.
Earlier, he had   interviewed others who had left Scientology.
Roy brought this and other   information he had gathered on Scientology s dirty tricks to Gordon, who had a   growing file I had also given him on Scientology’s “fair game law”:  That   stated that an “‘enemy’ of Scientology” such as me ”May be  injured by any   means by any Scientologist May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.
Strangers from all over   the world continued to call me for help on Scientology,  unaware of what I had   just gone though.
And then in July of 1977, I was shocked -- and thrilled to read front-page   stories in the Washington Post, The Boston Globe, and in fact   news papers all over the world stating that documents had just been seized from   inside Scientology revealing that they had once framed a writer critical of them   -- me.
Wouldn t that be great for Scientology?
He must have   been a Scientologist whom they sent to   spy on me and help   Scientology set me up.
I also  initiated my own legal actions   against Scientology while they piled on more suits, spies and harassment against   me.
I went on to write 11 more books  update:15 besides the first four , win 6 writing awards  including 2   for  The Scandal of Scientology,   do some travel writing, and have a newspaper   column on pets.
True, it s not as  glamorous  as the investigative reporting I   did with Scientology, but at least dogs don’t harass and cats don’t sue.
Yes, I often wish I had never ever heard the word “Scientology,” But despite   all that happened, I would still have done the same today, because no one else   was speaking out or working to expose them then.
Sometimes     I get discouraged because Scientology gets so much publicity from people like     Tom Cruise, John Travolta, etc.
My favorite was the man in his 50 s who   e-mailed me to say that years ago, after learning the truth about Scientology   from me, he left the cult, married, has 4 children  2 are twins  and now runs a   computer company employing 40+ people.
Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.
It is with great pride we welcome you to the Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.
Originally established in 1955 by Scientology Founder L.

And with exact Scientology techniques, you’ll discover them for yourself.
Because Scientology is the knowledge of you.
In the introduction to his new book, Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief, Lawrence Wright writes,  Scientology plays an outsize role in the cast of new religions that have arisen in the 20th century and survived into the 21st.
The book is a look inside the world of Scientology and the life of its founder, L.
A recent ad for Scientology claims to welcome 4.
This includes some Hollywood actors; Wright says that almost from the time Hubbard founded Scientology, he hoped to attract members from Hollywood.
Church of Scientology in Hollywood and set up the Celebrity Center with the goal of attracting notable celebrities.
Rock Hudson came in the door for a while, and, in those early days, they were constantly patrolling for someone who could be the public face of Scientology.
If you get into Scientology, you will go to auditing.
So I think he really did believe, to some extent, that Scientology was real, but he was constantly inventing it.
Scientology has another layer on top of that, and in Scientology there are these levels of spiritual accomplishment that are called  Operating Thetans.
We are all immortal souls, and part of Scientology is that you discover that in the course of your learning.
There s a widespread belief that he s going to return, and every Scientology church and his several residences and so on, they have his office ready for him.
In his residence in the Scientology compound in southern California there s a novel beside his bed, and they change his sheets on his bed daily and they set a table place for him for one at his dining room table.
The hacker activist group Anonymous and the Church of Scientology have famously had it out with each other for the past several years, and it looks like the pot is beginning to boil again.
A member of Anonymous sent us an email describing Scientology s alleged abuse of Craigslist as a means to recruit new members.
Not to be read home alone on a stormy night: Going Clear, Lawrence Wright’s scary book about Scientology and its influence, with its accounts of vindictive lawyers and apostate captives confined in the “Hole,” a building that held dozens of people at a time.
On March 18 2005, the Attorney-General filed his advice to the Supreme Court about     Scientology s case against us.
In his opinion, all claims of Scientology should be discarded.
The Supreme Court s ruling was   planned for July 8 2005, but got postponed because Scientology suddenly dropped the case.
On December 16 2005, the Supreme Court dismissed Scientology s appeal and made the previous ruling final.
Because Scientology withdrew their appeal, no recourse is possible after this, i.
And please take a look at the Scientology Litigation Kit , where I list the materials used for my defense and the lawsuit materials  lawsuits, plea, defense, rulings  and at postings and news about the Dutch Protest .
The Church of Scientology  or: CoS; or: Co$, as some of their opponents call it  sells its followers expensive courses which, if students study them carefully, are supposed to set them free   clear  them .
A former Scientology member, Steven Fishman, was brought before court because he committed several crimes in order to get the money to pay for these courses.
In an interview for Time Magazine, Fishman relayed those stories and blamed Scientology for his crimes.
When Fishman was then brought to court, he used parts of Scientology-documents to prove he had been brainwashed by the Church.
These Scientology documents thereby became public material: anybody could go to the court library and read them.
But the real story is that Scientology does not want their followers to know what s in store for them: they forbid everybody to read this material until they ve done lots of courses, stating that it would kill those who are not yet ready for it; but more probably because people may stop believing Scientology once they ve read this lousy sf stuff.
And of course Scientology asks their followers massive amounts of money for the  privilege  of reading this.
Indeed it does include some material that may or may not be copyrighted by RTC, Scientology s copyright bureau; but seeing that those fragments were included in the court-document, they may be published as part of that document.
Scientology has ordered various raids on providers or computersystems from which documents exposing Scientology were available; most notably FactNet, a group of people who are putting together an on-line archive about Scientology.
Ever since Scientology started to hunt down this document, the Fishman Affidavit is popping up everywhere.
Concerning the lawsuit that Scientology presented me with and my subsequent defense for the court, read here for the Dutch version and here for the English version.
For everybody who wants to know more about Scientology, please refer to Information on Scientology s raid on XS4all , which has many newspaper-articles about the case  both in Dutch and in English ; Ron Newman , who maintains a magnificent archive on the war that the Church of Scientology waged upon the net; or the newsgroup alt.
Why did Hubbard continue to publish Science Fiction after Scientology?
Respected German historian Guido Knopp has compared a speech by US actor Tom Cruise to the Church of Scientology with a call to war by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
The video above from a german documentary,  Missing in Happy Valley  and serves as an excellent introduction to this page about Scientology s roots.
Russian Law expressly states that Scientology is a dangerous cult.
Russian Health Ministry directly prohibits promotion and use of Scientology and Dianetics methods.
The court record is] replete with evidence  is nothing in reality but a vast enterprise to extract the maximum amount of money from its adepts by pseudo scientific theories.
Hubbard had fondness for the number 8 and used it extensively in scientology, as in Hubbard s books named Technique 88, Scientology 8-80, and one called 8-8008.
Note the colors and feeling of the Scientology Management logo below from their own pages.
In 1952, the term  Scientology  was introduced.
Corporate status was received by Scientology in 1954 in California.
Since that time,  Scientology  has been repeatedly questioned for it s bogus claims of medical healing and unexplained deaths.
Dianetics and Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard s personal references as a  war hero,  or  nuclear physicist,  are just a few of Scientology s false claims to recruit the unknowing.
L Ron Hubbard avoided the exposure of the fraudulent medical practices of  Scientology  by becoming a so-called  church.
Many of the methods and ideology that Hubbard used in Scientology are taken from other sources.
Influences of Aleister Crowley are found in Scientology  technology,  or teaching materials - including L Ron Hubbard s own admission that he was the  anti-Christ.
But in 1969, the same year that Scientology donned the crosses and minister s garb, was the same time that the  Thoth Tarot Card Deck  was published and sold,  a product produced years before, by Aleister Crowley with artist Lady Frieda Harris,  deceased in 1962.
The  Book of Thoth Tarot Card Deck  also holds some symbolism and influence that Hubbard used and vocalized in teachings to Scientology members.
Similarly, the  Fool Card  in the 1969 Aleister Crowley  Thoth Tarot Card Deck  has a triangle and double triangle Scientology s symbol with double triangles has one a lower  ARC triangle,   affinity, reality and communication,  and an upper triangle, the KRC triangle  knowledge, responsibility and control.
There is also  visible a faint S after  The Fool  on the  card above which looks much like the typeface used for the S in Scientology.
He told him that Scientology actually began on December the 1st, 1947.
Webmaster Comment: Those familiar with Scientology will recognize how similar the promises made to entice would be members into the National Socialists were to what Hubbard promises it s own members.
What a lot of people don t realize is that Scientology is black magic that is just spread out over a long time period.
But in Scientology it s stretched out over a lifetime, and so you don t see it.
Black magic is the inner core of Scientology --and it is probably the only part of Scientology that really works.
The Church of Scientology  is a dangerous cult that foists its dogma upon the gullible public.
A few years later, he founded the Church of Scientology after claiming to have discovered the soul .
Though all cults tend to be draconian about their dogma, after the advent of the internet , the Church became especially draconian in its attempt to stifle open discussion about Hubbard, Dianetics and Scientology.
Hubbard did start his own religion, calling it the  Church of Scientology,  and it has grown into an enterprise that today grosses over $100 million a year worldwide.
Sadly believers in Scientology do not survive as well as the belief system, far too many have died through Scientology related abuse, see Why are They Dead?
Spending your adult life in Scientology and going through all the levels, auditing sessions, and other courses will cost you between $300,000 and $500,000, which you would be much better off putting into a good mutual fund to save for retirement.
The first Church of Scientology was founded in 1953, hiding Hubbard s con scheme behind a screen of respectability and also avoiding lots of laws that didn t apply to churches.
At that time Scientology was beginning to expand outside the US.
In the following years Hubbard consolidated Scientology, establishing many of the organization s fundamental policies and practices.
However, Scientology also attracted increased negative attention as it grew, so in 1966 Hubbard resigned as the formal head of the Church and instead bought a ship to use as his base; he began calling himself  Commodore  and established the Sea Org to act as his agents and assistants in Scientology.
Meanwhile, Scientology continued to expand in the US and abroad.
Also in 1966, the infamous Guardian s Office was established to counter threats to Scientology, both internal and external.
In 1963, the FDA had seized a number of E-meters and charged the Church with making false claims about their ability to diagnose and treat illness and in 1967 the IRS revoked tax exemption from all Scientology-related entities in the US.
When the courts upheld this revocation in 1969, Scientology simply decided to withhold their owed taxes anyway, beginning a long war with the IRS that only ended in 1993.
He also introduced a new strategy to Scientology in the late 60s when he realized that Hollywood celebrities would be obvious and useful targets for Scientology.
The first Scientology  Celebrity Center  opened in Los Angeles in 1970.
In the early 70s, US government investigations were becoming a serious problem for Scientology.
In response Hubbard launched  Operation Snow White , a large scale infiltration of several US government agencies that were believed to have taken an interest in Scientology.
He remained on the run for the rest of his life, but always maintained contact with the Scientology organization through a group of people known as  Messengers .
The upheaval of the organization and Hubbard s absence  and likely worsening illness  allowed one of Hubbard s Messengers, David Miscavige to gradually assume control of Scientology.
As a Messenger, Miscavige spoke with Hubbard s authority, and he instigated a thorough reorganization of Scientology, with himself at the top.
He also created the Religious Technology Center to license the all-important copyrights of Hubbard s works, and effectively run the entire Scientology organization.
As chairman of the RTC, Miscavige became the de-facto head of Scientology.
As the now undisputed head of Scientology, David Miscavige started a large-scale publication program of new versions of Scientology s books and courses.
Scientology, and especially David Miscavige, scored an epic win in 1993 when they reached a settlement with the IRS over the taxes Scientology had been withholding ever since their tax exempt status was revoked in 1967.
IRS relented and agreed to restore tax exempt status to Scientology and all related entities.
This new agreement extended the exemption to areas of Scientology that would not normally have been covered by normal charitable status, such as religious education.
Besides the obvious advantages of now effectively never having to pay taxes on any of their business, the agreement also made it easier for Scientology to push for similar recognition in other countries.
The early and mid-90s also marked the first skirmishes in a long war between Scientology and the Internet.
Having failed epically to shut the newsgroup down in 1995, Scientology switched tactics and instead started flooding the group with trolls and apologists from the Sea Org and OSA.
Meanwhile, in Real Life, Scientology continued business as usual: expanding, clearing the planet, and screwing its rank-and-file members over so Miscavige could indulge in his love for expensive motorcycles and underwater photography.
The program made significant changes to the way Scientology s  auditors  were trained, essentially forcing a lot of members to pay again for courses they had already taken.
But not all has been well for Scientology recently, particularly in Europe.
The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution started monitoring Scientology activities in Germany in the mid-90s, considering them to present a potential danger to the democratic society.
In Belgium Scientology may be facing criminal charges after a 10 year long government investigation has uncovered evidence of fraud, organized crime, illegal medical practices and several other transgressions.
Meanwhile, a government committee in France has recommended dissolving the Church of Scientology there, on the grounds that its activities threatens public order  and seven of its top members are to stand trial in Paris on fraud charges after an investigation into allegations by a former member that the church swindled her out of more than $28,000.
France s top appeals court has upheld a fraud conviction and fines totalling hundreds of thousands of euros against the Church of Scientology, for taking advantage of vulnerable followers.
Around January 14, an internal Scientology propaganda video was leaked on the Internet.
The video showcases irritating actor and Scientology front-person Tom Cruise rambling incoherently for ten minutes about how awesome Scientology is, punctuated by random crazy laughter.
But then, in a move that showed their complete lack of comprehension of how the Internet works, Scientology filed a copyright complaint and had the video removed.
Anonymous took his words to heart, put on Guy Fawkes masks and flooded into the streets of cities all over the world on February 10 to protest in front of Scientology Orgs.
Anonymous has pledged to continue the fight for as long as it takes, making these protests probably the greatest threat to Scientology since the 70s.
It also links to pro-Scientology pages to demonstrate that, at least, he hears to both sides of the debate.
The Sea Organization, or  Sea Org , is Scientology s  advanced religious retreat  but really forms part of its vast management and bureaucratic wing.
Promoted to members as some sort of utopian cruise ship in which the most advanced levels of Scientology are taught, those who have joined Sea Org instead found themselves required to sign a  billion year contract  with Sea Org, surrender their passports upon boarding, live in squalid group quarters with no privacy, perform menial chores as assigned, and suffer  punishments such as being locked in the chain locker for petty offenses.
However, neither the  billion year contract  nor the  freeloader s bill  are legally enforceable and Scientology will never try to uphold them in a law court, knowing how hard a judge would laugh at them.
Sterling Management Systems is a large group awareness training run by the Church of Scientology and promoted to doctors and dentists.
The Cult Awareness Network, originally a mainstream anti-cult organization founded 1978 in response to the mass suicide of Jim Jones followers, fell on hard times  due to aggressive litigation against it by Scientology and by Landmark Education and the Pentecostal  Life Tabernacle Church  , and its assets purchased from bankruptcy court in 1996 by the Church of Scientology, and now functions as a Scientology front group as well.
Most directly related to Scientology are the small groups collectively referred to as the Free Zone , consisting mostly of former Scientologists who continue to practice Scientology, but do so outside the official Church of Scientology.
Scientology refers to all these as  squirrel organizations , a Hubbard term for anyone who appropriates Scientology doctrines outside the Co$.
Less clearly related as to what extent they still incorporate Scientology teachings are former Scientologists who later went into business for themselves.
Neo-Tech borrows heavily from Scientology s quasi-sci-fi style and imagery, but their main influence is Ayn Rand .
Is Scientology a religion?
There is some debate about whether Scientology is, in fact, a religion.
On the Scientology main page it refers to itself as a religion,  saying,  The religion comprises a body of knowledge extending from certain fundamental truths.
Through Scientology, people all over the world are achieving the long-sought goal of true spiritual release and freedom.
However it must be remembered that what Scientology says openly to the world, and what Scientology says secretly to its  advanced  members are two different things — and consequently it is not necessarily wise to take at face value anything which may appear on their public site.
Does Scientology have such a belief?
However on their front page they say:  In Scientology no one is asked to accept anything as belief or on faith.
On the other hand, as we noted above, what Scientology says — and what is the actual truth — are two different things.
On the face of it, Scientology would seem to match many of the definitions included in our religion article.

This can be compared with the newer fields,  Scientology-logy  - colloquially  scientolology  - i.
With the branching out of more specific sciences,  scientology  today has come to mean primarily the original object, i.
In this sense of meaning, scientology is not to be confused with psychology , the non-rigorous, most often prejudicial, and inherently unscientific study of many of the same topics or with psychiatry ,  a major world religion, which, however, has a - in a comparative socio-religious context - rather unusual corporate front end, consisting of socalled pharmaceutical companies producing pills, believed  by its followers to produce beneficial effects to the psyche.
In 1950, Elrond Hubbard , the founder of Scientology, as a precursor to his main work, published the book  Callanetics , a self-help and exercise system conceived and designed to reach the deepest layers of the psyche and deep tissue muscle groups - with the subject achieving peace of mind and rock-hard washboard abs in the proces.
In 1952, Hubbard by releasing the book  Scientology  gave birth to modern scientific study, ardently insisting that any scientific theory should be verified - or at least not falsified - by experimental fact, proposing the now well known cycle of science, including the steps  audit, explain, predict, control .
The  decades following the publication of  Scientology  brought vast amounts of new knowledge into existence as well as groundbreaking advances in technology.
As scientology has taught us that correlation implies implication, this is generally attributed to Scientology.
Critics have suggested this to be  the single most predictable joke on scientology, EVER!
A vocal critic has discredited this as  the second most obvious joke on scientology, it s like geez, get your act together.
Many countries have  - contrary to the wishes of scientologist - labelled scientology as a religious belief , possibly related to UFO religions.
The re-classification of scientology as a religious belief, has happened most notably in countries where the religion of psychiatry through lobbying exerts notable influence on legislators, including the US, where the IRS has decided scientology is legally considered a religious belief, under the  If it does not make sense, it is a religious belief -doctrine.
The most important example of a country which - in contrast - refuses to label scientology as religion, is Germany, which has thus become a refuge and beacon of hope to scientologist world wide.
Tom Cruise - though not himself engaged in direct scientific study, American actor Tom Cruise is a staunch defender of Scientology and has on more than one occasion threatened to throw anyone who claims    Xenu   is a mere myth, in the nearest volcano.

The Church of Scientology, known for celebrity and controversy, is now in the middle of another public relations crisis as a former high-ranking official has created a firestorm, first with an email to church members and then testimony in a Texas state court alleging she saw the church s leader punch another executive in the face, and that at his direction she herself was slapped.
Miscavige physically punching in the face and wrestling to the ground another very senior executive at Scientology International level,  Cook testified in court.
In numerous letters to ABC News, Scientology officials have denied that David Miscavige ordered Debbie Cook to be slapped, or that he punched a fellow executive.
Cook also testified that in 2007, while doing work at the Scientology International Base in Southern California, she was taken to a pair of double-wide trailers she called  the hole.
In a letter to ABC News, a lawyer for the Church of Scientology flat out denies that the  hole  exists, or that there was ever a place known as  the hole.
Cook and certain other Scientology executives and staff members  did participate in religious discipline, a program of ethics and correction entered into voluntarily as part of their religious observances,  but insists,  the idea that the church held her or anyone else against their will  denied.
When Cook and her husband decided to leave the Church of Scientology in October 2007, they signed lengthy contracts agreeing not to publicly criticize Scientology or its leaders, and in return received checks for $50,000 apiece.
There are hints that Scientology membership was limited to whites, at           least initially, in their organizations in southern Africa.
In the second quote, Hubbard praises the South African organization,           that, in spite of the limited white population from which to recruit,           managed to outproduce all other Scientology organizations.
Now if we can get white population, immigrants and big companies              and so on moving into Africa and if we can get with that              Scientology well established in Southern Africa, why we can then              look forward to a salvage operation base, in case the northern              hemisphere s lights go out.
Hubbard sought to create a Scientology homeland in South Africa or           Rhodesia  Zimbabwe .
Hubbard suggests the worldwide conspiracy against him and           Scientology can be tracked back to the             Jewish bankers             who are funding his arch enemy, the World Federation of Mental Health.
Apparently           Hubbard is dismayed at the prospect of an influx of Asians into Scientology in the area, if their attention was diverted from           war with the Americans.
