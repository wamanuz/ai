On the half-century anniversary of the Seattle Monorail, more than five years after the end of the last attempt to expand the monorail along a route from Ballard to West Seattle, an activist says it’s time to try again.
The announcement comes from Elizabeth Campbell, known for past campaigns including a push for a rebuilt Alaskan Way Viaduct .
This morning the 50th anniversary of the Seattle Monorail’s service is being celebrated, and this morning the board of the newly created Century Transportation Company  “CenTran”  is announcing that it is launching its campaign to create a public transportation authority to build an approximately 16 mile monorail High Capacity Personal Rapid Transit System along the west side transportation corridor of Seattle.
95A, which will authorize a public vote to be taken on the formation of the authority, along with the authorization for initial funding for the planning, design, and engineering of the transportation system.
The system will flow from north Ballard, through 15th Avenue NW, swing along the west side of the Seattle Center, then go west to Western Avenue, then run south along the right-of-way of the Alaskan Way Viaduct that is to be vacated, south to 1st Avenue, then west to West Seattle.
A map of proposed route alignments can be accessed here.
CenTran will capitalize on the prior planning, design, and engineering work that was completed for the Seattle Popular Monorail project.
This will particularly ensure the timely planning and construction of this critical transportation system to serve the west side of Seattle.
CenTran will especially endeavor to create an up-to-date, viable financial plan for both the construction and operation of the  CenTran monorail high capacity personal rapid transit system.
Financing for the construction may include public-private partnerships, public stock sales, and a combination of revenue or general obligation bond issues.
5 and $2 Billion dollars – for a 16+ mile monorail and 18 stations.
Following a authorizing vote in August, 2012, it is estimated that the planning and design phase will take one year, followed by two years to complete the environmental review and permitting processes.
During this time another public vote will be held to authorize the funding and construction of the system.
Construction then is estimated to commence in 2016, followed by completion and operation of the complete system by December, 2018.
The system being proposed will be fully grade-separated, will utilize public right-of-ways where feasible, and serve major destination points that are most likely to be produce the highest ridership volumes.
Special emphasis is being place on station locations that can be multipurpose uses, in terms of transportation use in conjunction with residential and commercial uses.
Initial talks have been started between CenTran and the Mayor Mayor’s office about CenTran’s interest in participating in the transportation planning between Sound Transit and the City of Seattle for a high capacity transportation system in Seattle – monorail is federally recognized by definition and function as a high capacity transportation system, and CenTran’s grade separated feature also fulfills the standard of high capacity transit as it runs in its own dedicated corridor.
Recently, CenTran also weighed in with the Arena Project partners – as a transportation authority CenTran can partner with public and private projects that contribute to the establishment and operation of the transportation system.
95A and other applicable law.
Providing a forum in which people and organizations can work together for the common transportation or mobility good of themselves and their community.
At present there are nine additional board member positions open  CenTran currently has six board members .
An invitation is being extended citywide and to community, business, and special interest organizations, asking to please circulate this invite.
95A The Authority will be proposing to construct an approximately 16 mile long, dual guideway monorail system between Ballard and West Seattle, in one or more phases.
Board members will be actively involved in all facets of City of Seattle transportation planning work and related regional transportation planning work, in terms of how they relate to CenTran’s transportation system’s goals.
Board members will support the work of the Century Transportation Authority and any associated spin-off entities.
Board members will provide mission-based leadership, strategic governance, and be involved in the search for and appointment of the Authority’s executive director; and to provide polity and guidance for the Authority’s director to follow.
Board Members’ responsibilities will also include: setting policies, reviewing outcomes and metrics, establishing and approving the Authority’s annual budget, providing audit reports, making material business decisions, and meeting all, legal and fiduciary responsibilities.
Interim Board terms will be for a minimum of 14 months.
Permanent board member terms will be for five years.
Experience with City of Seattle or Washington state issues, preferably transportation related, or a record of involvement with Seattle neighborhood affairs that includes some transportation matters experience.
The experience should be at least two years, demonstrate a commitment to public service, and involve in-depth participation in terms of issue complexity, and be a public or documented record of participation.
Expertise in a specific area which can help CenTran flourish is desirable.
For example, special knowledge, education, or experience in one or more of the following fields: legal, financial, economic development, real estate, transportation, public or private infrastructure development or construction experience.
Leadership and management experience, especially with publicly or privately funded transportation.
Commitment to the project grade separated system.
Board members must be interested in the Authority’s business and its continued well-being.
They should not be serving just for the money or for personal interests.
Possess the time and energy to devote to board duties.
Board members will be expected to spend time preparing for and attending board meetings, and to serve on additional committees.
I am thrilled to learn of this project.
Maybe there will be an answer to W.
Seattle’s transportation needs.
I hope this works out.
I was so disappointed when the monorail project fell through last time.
April fools already!
YEEEAAAH!
An opportunity to go to Bumbershoot without driving.
Would like to be optomistic-not even close right now.
Ok, I’ll vote 5 times for it….
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Well, you know this will never fly.
It runs from large established neighborhoods to the downtown core and actually makes sense for commuters.
From West Seattle to the stadiums or to downtown would be a breeze.
Expect the city council and Unsound Transit to come out strongly against it.
Too much transportation, not enough social engineering.
Oh, and no billion dollar tunnels to drill.
Kudos to WSB for picking this up before the Seattle Transit Blog.
7M of taxpayer money, you’ve got to take it.
How could this fail?
And this all must be contingent on being agreed upon and passing with or without public vote, because we’ve all seen how worthless voters approval is on these things!
Peter, interesting comment … It was a news release that I’m sure they received too.
But I don’t know if they are staffed full-time or if they are somebody’s labor of love … WSB is our 24 7 business so if something comes in on Saturday morning, hey, we’re here.
Anyway, I came across the website some weeks ago and sent a note to Ms.
Campbell asking for more details.
She never replied.
I figured that if it were a for-real effort, they’d eventually go public.
Y’know, a town with money is like a mule with a spinning wheel.
No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!
Love it!
I love winning the lottery too!
I like my odds on the lottery better.
My big question has been and will continue to be.
Why do we need a separate rail system.
Why not expand the light rail over to west seattle.
Make one large interconnected system like in my other areas with multiple destinations with some central hubs.
Hop the green line to west seattle, transfer to the red line, ballard end point is the blue line, etc.
Though multi-billion dollar price tags are always significant, it seems like such a system would pay for itself relatively quickly.
The average Seattle driver wastes around 44 hours per year sitting in traffic or, in dollar figures, around $1,000 in lost time.
Considering that there are around 900,000 average daily car trips within Seattle, if you factor in the additional savings from fuel, automotive maintenance, insurance, medical bills and court costs from accidents, etc.
Looks like they want to avoid the image of a “cab driver idea” this time around.
I’m behind it, again.
Could be good, could be bad.
I just hope they don’t destroy small businesses like the last attempt.
Purchase locations for sub market value, decide to dump the project and resell the locations for profit.
It’s a great business plan for government profit.
Does anyone know how they would get across the Duwamish?
Love the whole idea, I was just always curious about this particular design point  too young to be interested involved in affairs back then .
I have always liked the thought of a monorail from West Seattle.
They need to fix the spelling error on the map;  it’s “Fauntleroy”.
I’m all for this.
Lets get this thing built and elect the proper people this time to lead it.
Come on, give it up.
It’s time to move on.
How many cities have successfully built a monorail system that is used for anything other than a tourist novelty?
In contrast, how many cities have successfully built a light rail system?
As a structural engineer, I think this is a ridiculous idea.
This is not just based on a bias, but on professional expertise about what it would take to build and sustain a monorail system.
28th – Ooops!
Nice catch!
I agree – I’ve always thought the monorail or even light rail would be great to have in WS.
Especially since we keep building more residential buildings, we really need alternate ways of getting out of WS.
Enough with the monorail already.
It’s stupid technology.
Lots of cities have built a monorail.
Not a single city has built two of them.
Monorails combine the worst of trains and buses.
You can’t run them at grade.
You can’t run them underground  feasibly .
They are also nearly impossible for passengers to disembark during an emergency.
Doesn’t anyone remember when the old monorail had a fire and the passengers had to sit there on the thing until help arrived because there is no where to go?
It happened.
You can’t safely walk off a monorail train onto a monorail track.
You want mass transit?
Great.
Do what everyone else in the world does and build a train.
Light rail.
Heavy rail.
Doesn’t matter.
Trains run at grade, underground, and elevated.
Monorails only run on elevated tracks because the cars have to overhang the beam.
Trains can easily combine into a network with switches.
They can share cars freely depending on need.
Not monorails.
I don’t get people’s fascination with monorails.
There’s simply no advantage to them.
They are amusement park rides.
Think of the greatest mass transit systems in the world.
New York.
Paris.
London.
It’s all trains.
Name the greatest monorail system in the world.
Oh, that’s right, there aren’t any.
Enough of this nonsense already.
Oh god, not again!
You have got to be kidding me, and how will you finance this project?
Oh wait let me guess by adding a fee to car tabs, and how will you make the steet grade up the hill into West Seattle?
How many more people are going to have their houses and business stolen for a no where project?
Why can’t we just get light rail?
Agreed, light rail surface rail would be best.
I wanted the monorail because it was SOMETHING, but if someone could come up with a feasible light rail extension, or surface rail plan, I would much prefer that.
Of course that would likely take a lane of traffic away, and the car-dependent would not stand for that.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
I’ll vote for it a 6th, and if necessary a 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th time.
Eventually, the logic of this system will prevail.
At grade surface transit is NOT what we want; just look at what’s happening to the so-called RapidRide.
All these transportation options already exist people.
Its call The Bus.
Nighthawk has hit the nail on the head.
Why a separate system?
Just extend light rail like they are doing to the East Side and Capitol Hill.
We do need a better system here but the key word is system.
Some Seattleites have a fixation on monorail.
I am certain it goes back to 1962.
Get over it already.
All West Seattle needs is a rail branch a lousy four miles away at the SODO light rail station.
Four miles away.
Wow, imagine that.
And you don’t even have to whine ad nauseum when we get the occasional snow storm….
I’m a Seattle native and I wonder if sometime in the last several decades or so the ENTIRE city of what used to be generally practical common sense people was replaced with utopian dreamers out of touch with reality.
Good grief.
The first time around it was a stunt for the World’s Fair.
Cute, and useful enough to get tourists from the hotel district to the separate-the-tourists-from-their-cash district, but mostly just an oddity.
The second time it was a case of some not-too-bright local yokels gunning for nostalgia, and soon got overtaken by a bunch of consultant types who laughed all the way to the bank.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Transpiration projects like this CANNOT be citizen run.
They have to be at least supported by the powers that be or they will get thrown under the bus when costs get to high.
Doesn’t anyone remember when Nickels doomed the last Monorail vote by saying the people should decide  aka he wanted it to die  and that was after over 100 mil was spent already.
This is an absolutely ridiculous proposition and it doesn’t help that all the electeds in the city think Campbell is a whack job already.
If anything should be considered it is whether light rail can come to west Seattle but I have heard the bridge cannot support a surface alignment, structurally.
And the lower bridge won’t work because of the waterway.
Maybe we should build a tunnel under the sound heh?
Seaviewer – I hope everyone reads your comments.
Enough already about the Monorail.
This isn’t the Jetson’s.
We don’t have flying cars yet.
All one has to do is look at Portland’s light rail system for a model to use and improve upon.
I wonder how many millions of dollars have been spent on the Monorail so far, and the tax payer still voted it down.
Hey, let’s spend some more money on it, but this time we will call it the “Popular Cen-Tran”.
That’ll fool’m.
They’ll pass it this time fer sure.
And yes Dave.
Good use of the word “hemorrhage”!
No way.
DA and Seaviewer, I completely agree.
Impractical and expensive.
00 per foot.
Not including any the inevitable additional design, building, litigation etc.
Comment by M.
A bridge to Ballard would be best.
I didn’t read every comment so this may be a repeat… but does anyone else wonder why someone is AGAIN trying to build a monorail when we have a currently expanding light rail system that a monorail won’t be able to interface with?
It is fact that our city needs to do anything possible to stack the chips in it’s favor when it comes to mass transit.
Light rail all the way… it’s already being built to cover the eastern half of the city!
Ballard to West Seattle, Ballard to UW to Bellevue, West Seattle to Beacon to Mercer Island Bellevue.
Go.
There should be some kind of light rail from west Seattle to downtown.
It seems like a lot of  people won’t use transit unless it picks them up at their front door and delivers them to their exact desired destination in under 20 minutes, for free or close to it.
Monorail, light rail or bus- how many of these armchair experts would use them regularly?
OMG, who is the stupid idiot that would even mention this?
Just because some “person” states “it” in their blog comment does not make it true.
Theoretically monorail can do anything rail can do.
But there are always pros and cons, you can not ever get it all with one technology…the question is, which is right for the W Seattle to Ballard corridor.
If it is Monorail then stay away from the decisions that successfully sacked monorail the last time: Run it down the middle of the street, stay off CA ave run it down Fauntleroy or better yet stop at the Junction.
Stay out of the Seattle center, Design duel tracks along the entire length incl the W Sea Bridge, and hands off the old monorail.
Also fund it fairly and completely.
But do something…BRT ain’t gonna cut it w o dedicated and separated lanes.
By all means let’s spend two billion dollars poorly replicating what the RapidRide will do starting in 2012–express transit downtown every 10 minutes.
Apparently Unsound Transit has a plan to “study” a light rail line in West Seattle.
I think they plan to start around 2030.
With that time line, by the time it’s built I’ll be taking a dirt nap and my kids will probably be retired in Arizona.
I’m sorry but the Seattle Monorail is a tourist attraction, plain and simple and should not be expanded.
Expanding the Sound Transit light rail should be the focus.
Having two competing train systems in Puget sound will confuse voters who may not realize that light rail and the monorail are not compatable with each other, and spread the already minimal budgets too thin causing neither system to as effective as they should have been by now.
I’d rather push for a light rail branch to w.
5-10 years than some monorail for our great-great grandkids.
I would prefer to see a marriage of streetcars light rail in WS rather than a monorail system.
Ill vote for any train-based transit to w Seattle.
Simple as that.
Ugh, please no!
The money would be better spent on expanding bus service and or light-rail.
I’m not sure the technology is up to the task.
Can Monorail trains now ‘switch tracks’ as light rail can?
Also, break-downs need to be accessible to rescue personnel.
Do we agree that the high-traffic corridors should share the same technology?
The ease with which a person can travel without being in a bus or light rail at grade, such as the elevated Metro in Washington DC or Subway in New York – I say yes for Seattle.
Built to last more than 100 years and significantly improve the stuck in traffic dilemma.
More buses or at grade light rail will sit in more stuck traffic.
What a wonderful idea to round out the transportation options.
We can’t do what Portland already did!
That would be unseemly!
San Francisco is Marsha Brady: beautiful and confident.
Portland is Cindy Brady:  adorable and innovative.
Seattle is Jan Brady: insecure.
Wanting to be like Marsha or her mother Carol  Los Angeles  and jealous of Cindy.
Thank you Seaviewer at 2:10 pm March 24, 2012.
You wrote everything I wanted to write.
Saved me a lot of time.
At this point, and train type mass transit is better than none.
I dont know all the details, but seriously?
We need realists transit options here in war Seattle.
I will vote for any tax Increase the will bring a better alternative to car and bus transit.
As a side note, does anyone know what light rails costs per mile as compared to monorail?
My husband and I go between West Seattle and Ballard frequently.
I’d like to have some relatively direct means of transportation and I might even use it.
Bus transfers just don’t cut it.
Maybe WS should succeed try to again.
We should be building a rail line that will work with the one we already have… that said, we have to do SOMETHING.
I, and many people I know, would use a system running from Ballard to West Seattle though downtown at least three times a week.
Who cares what Elizabeth Campbell has to say?
Is she any sort of decision maker in the Seattle government?
No.
Do the majority of people in Seattle actually care what she has to say?
No.
In fact, when it comes to Seattle, I bet more people care about the season premiere of “The Killing” more than they care about what she has to say.
Please stop showing crap like this.
Nobody cares about what she has to say.
It’s really not going to be cost effective.
The best AFFORDABLE – and therefore doable solution – would be a REAL bus rapid transit system  BRT .
Use the most efficient, green buses you can buy, get as much PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BUS ONLY LANES you can possibly create and run them often.
You get 75%+ of the people-moving, time-certain efficiency at 10%-20% of the cost.
Anything else is just not doable.
And I worked on the previous SPMA project and supported it.
Its time has passed and light rail is ridiculously expensive.
Like $100M+ mi.
BRT is the only real option to rail.
Whether this goes anywhere or not, so to speak, at least it’s a reminder that our transportation problems are far from solved.
Adding to what already exists is the smartest and most practical solution.
Something has to be done.
We cant just sit back and allow our transportation system to go by the wayside.
Light rail isnt serving our part of the city primarily due to a lack of solutions on how to get it to cross the Duwamish river.
The West Seattle Bridge may not be structurally efficient to build it there.
SLU downtown.
It is amazing to read  how many are not up to date on improvements of monorail technology since the Seattle Alweg was built 50 years ago.
Heavy  rail,is more environmental friendly, can climb 12%, compared to 2% for Parson’s heavy rail.
A billion dollars can be saved on elemination of massive underground facilities, which has no flexibility.
Professional presentations of the Urbanaut has been proposed across 520 Bridge,the Alaska Viaduct,the West Seattle -Ballard new routes handling many more riders not the old ones .
However, both WDOT and Sound Transit Consultant, Parson, covered it up as non-existant.
Why don’t you call these agencies  and learn about what happened.
Urbanaut response and large investments was from request for proposal  RFP  of alternatives.
Why would we want to start from scratch with a totally new transit agency when we’ve already got Sound Transit, SDOT, and Metro Transit.
Why not try and work with existing agencies to build light rail to West Seattle.
With light rail, the system could be connected with the whole regional transit system instead of a Monorail system that is TOTALLY disconnected with all other forms of transit.
Haven’t we wasted enough money?
There are proven success stories of light rail and monorail systems around the world, but Seattle already has a successful light rail infrastructure including maintenance facilities, existing routes, extra train cars, trained workers, and most importantly: room for expansion.
A monorail could be successful, but in our situation, an expansion of the light rail would be more successful and easier to implement.
It would be great to have Elizabeth’s resources and energies behind a light rail expansion.
Perhaps Seattle Transit and Elizabeth could learn from each other and develop an integrated transit system that provides transportation options for citizens built with budget-sensitive capital costs.
I believe the 4 miles of track to connect west Seattle to the existing SODO light rail station could be built quite inexpensively when compared to a new monorail system.
Even if you do not support the monorail, still sign the petition with the words: “EXPAND LIGHT RAIL” so your voice may be heard.
Comment by S.
If the Monorail project would not have been killed in 2005, we would have a line running from West Seattle to Crown Hill TODAY!
Too bad Seattle doesn’t have any ‘vision’ or balls to pull the trigger on soemthing needed.
I know:  Let’s have 8 more years of studies, round-tables, community forums, etc.
15 Billion instead of $2 Billion.
Sorry, comment time is over.
WSB covers West Seattle 24 7, with your help.
Got a tip or question about news happening now?
Join us now for a Town Hall meeting on Ebola in America, a roundtable discussion with medical professionals.
Mayor Mike McGinn and Deputy Chief Dick Reed announced changes in the Seattle Police Department s regulations for new recruits.
SEATTLE -- While you probably won t see officers with Mike-Tyson facial tattoos smoking joints while on bike patrol, the Seattle Police Department has loosened some of its regulations for new recruits in an effort to employ officers who better reflect the community they serve.
According to Mayor Mike McGinn, who announced the changes Monday morning in Beacon Hill, the city plans on hiring more than 300 new police officers over the next five years.
When we announced SPD 20 20, we promised to do everything possible to make sure we’re recruiting new officers for our police force who reflect the diversity and values of the community they serve,” McGinn said in a statement.
As part of those changes, the police department is clarifying some of its regulations for officers  personal appearance, including tattoos, branding and other body modifications.
Sgt.
Sean Whitcomb said the question of tattoos used to be confusing for applicants, even Ivy-League-educated ones, who would look at the job requirements and feel like tattoos would disqualify them.
Whitcomb said.
The department has now made changes to the rules to make it clear that tattoos and other body modifications will not disqualify applicants and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis as long as it does not prevent them from maintaining a professional appearance.
In addition, as part of changes announced in December following the passage of I-502, new recruits must simply not have used marijuana in the past year.
Previously, recruits were required to not have used pot in the past three years and fewer than 25 times overall.
Officers, like all city employees, will not be allowed to use pot as it would put federal grant money at risk, Whitcomb said.
He said it also conflicts with officers  oaths to uphold the law as marijuana use is still illegal at the federal level.
The Seattle Police Department is also hoping to increase the diversity of its officers by partnering with community organizations, such as the Atlantic Street Center, Filipino Community of Seattle and El Centro De La Raza, and hosting community-based workshops to prepare possible new recruits.
Other changes include new advertising and other materials shaped  by community input, the waving of a $25 application fee, and an increased use of social media.
Yet another reason to steer clear of the rat-hole that Seattle has become.
Our government spends six years and who knows how much money to make state laws gender-neutral  fisherman = fisherperson  to be politically correct.
Now basically what they are saying is that they can t find police officers in minority neighborhoods who don t have a tatoo or prior conviction or aren t stoners.
Seriously?
That s not discrimination?
WHAT A JOKE!
Can t make the cut for King County Sheriff s Office, another County Agency, or WSP because of drug use?
Cool, stoner cops.
This calls for a new version of the old movie,  The Gang That Couldn t Shoot Straight .
Since they have a lower standard for becoming Mayor of Seattle, McGinn thought it would make since to lower the standards for SPD too.
Don t expect to see anything different on SPD force any time soon.
It makes me sad to see so much bias against other people.
All the negative comments about tattoos and smoking pot really makes me sad.
It seems we have no respect for diversity here.
Comments about pot heads, about tattoos being called disfigurement, and comments like  why not hire gays in tutus .
Personally I d rather judge a man or woman by the content of their character, not what they smoke, or eat or drink or wear.
And given the track record of the thugs in the SPD and Bellevue, I d say we re not doing very well of choosing people on the content of their character; but then maybe that s because we ve so narrowly defined who can apply.
Makes it easier to recruit.
Instead of going out looking for candidates,  just wait at the court house.
Doesn t say much for the minorities.
The best of the best are criminals!
I m a veteran who goes to VA on a regular basis.
One thing that I ve noticed is that you can generally tell the  generation  of a given vet by the amount of ink they show.
In my period of service, there were a lot of guys who had a tattoo or three.
I myself have one.
Tattoos were the minority but common enough as to not elicit any comment.
As the years have progressed there are more and more guys with full arm or full back tats.
A significant minority of veterans from the GWOT OIF OIF are carrying an awful lot of ink.
It has become so common that I would not be surprised if it was now the majority.
Given that the military is a prime recruiting ground for police, I m not at all surprised by the idea that most departments have to loosen up their tattoo standards.
But I think that having what I call  idiot rivets  installed in your head or your ex-girlfriend s name branded into your flesh are well below what I think of as the standards for theÂ appearanceÂ of someone that society entrusts so much authority.
While the mayor etc Â are loosening disfigurement requirements how about removing any weight restrictions on new recruits?
That mayor of yours is simply crazy-town.
In time, when the pendulum of sanity finally swings back towards center this McSchwinn goofball will be given the credit and punishment he so richly deserves.
Haha!
Highlighted top story and read the preview of the first few lines and saw  Mike-Tyson facial tattoos smoking joints  and instantly knew who wrote the article and had to click it to read for the lulz.
Mad Dog 2020 and a hit of acid.
City limits.
SPD.
Seattle really needs.
D.
Mayor Mike?
Perhaps you remember the dope running squads of Miami officers and the deaths associated with this group of savages recruited by a liberal city administration.
I like the idea that it would reflect the community and so what if they have tat s.
And, if they get some new officer s trained correctly, the police brutality and abuse might slowly be controllable.
Diversity is always great especially in Seattle.
Congrat s McGinn!
When I applied to the Stater Patrol back in  85, almost turned my application even though I had been dry for two years, then I  stretch  the truth on how many times total prior.
LOL!
Solution, lower hiring standards and add a big dose of affirmative action.
Seattle Police Department has loosened some of its  regulations for new recruits in an effort to employ officers who better  reflect the community they serve.
So does that mean officers assigned to Capitol Hill will be wearing pink, and in tight shorts?
Whew so my tramp stamp won t keep me from being disqualified from the elite spd!
Me thinks stonedMcginn should get a shave and get on that bad motor scooter and ride, ride right on out a here.
Ok, this stuff is pretty benign.
But, the thought of Electric Mikey involved in Police policy making is more than scary.
Perhaps Seattle voters ought to do the same thing that King Co.
Oh, wait, a police chief elected by the same people that elected Mikey and Jim the Shrink McDermott.
Seattle politics are kinda sad.
By the way, Â how whacked out would you have to be to have McDermott as yourÂ psychiatrist?
I know, I know, this comment is unfocused and rambling.
Yes, because hiring recruits with lots of tatts who recently smoked pot is still better than many of the current sworn guys girls your agency has .
Officers must have refrained from smoking pot for at least one year, but thankfully get to keep using opiate-based prescription painkillers.
Because, you know, opiate abuse isn t something that would ruin your body, mind, and make important jobs like police work dangerous by any means.
About time.
Tattoos are so normal around here, I find it weird when I meet someone with no tattoos.
Ankle BiterÂ Â Â Â  A chubby unshaven bike blight?
I read today.
Karma Â Ill take that over officers who shoot bumbling old men.
Just when you thought Seattle s ethics, morals and standards couldn t sink any lower.
Attila Â I once entered the mens room at Frankfurt airport and saw two transvestites doing makeup.
I thought I entered the womens room by mistake and bolted.
Goodwin Â Repeated failure to obey the law is an image problem in your mind?
BrodyRodyPartDeux Â  I ll have to open another restaurant within the Seattle City limits to feed the cops with the muchies.
That would do it!
FreedomFirst Â  @quidproquo Â  I actually moved here from the south, have also lived in MN and CA.
Tattoos are pretty universally accepted outside of extremely small towns.
FreedomFirst Â  @quidproquo Â You think people with tattoos have a tough time finding a job outside of Seattle?
FreedomFirst tattoos are universally accepted in  some  professions.
That full, wraparound arm and shoulder tattoo looks great on a 20 30 year old with a ripped body, and not so hot on a 70 year old with bat wings.
Chuckmeister Â  @quidproquo Â  @FreedomFirst Â  Like, what are thoseÂ GaugesÂ in your earlobes gonna look like when you are in your 80 s and your ears flop into your food like aÂ bassetÂ hound s?
Chuckmeister Â Also,Â On the  for now  comment, my grandpa had a mermaid that he got in the navy in the late 1940s and it was definitely timeless.
It was tasteful and represented a time in his life that he wanted a happy reminder of.
ChuckmeisterÂ It really depends how you go about it.
There are plenty of people with absolutely timeless works of art tattood on them.
2yykn Â Â  They shouldn t be automatically excluded because someone got a kitchen tattoo that looks like garbage.
I d think more than twice about doing something so obvious and so hard to reverse.

On the   morning of March 8, 1970, two half-mile long columns of vehicles began   forming in a south Seattle neighborhood.
As the convoys headed north onlookers could see the red   cloth banners streaming from the antennas of the automobiles.
When the   caravans reached their destinations, both the north and south sides of Fort   Lawton, the occupants of the cars launched a coordinated effort to occupy   the fort and establish it as a cultural and social services center for   Seattle’s growing Native American population.
The Native activists who invaded Fort Lawton that day were   ultimately successful in their goal of establishing an urban Indian cultural   center at the site.
While similar centers already existed in San Francisco,   Minneapolis, and New York, what was to become Daybreak Star Center was the   first to be established through militant protest.
The Fort Lawton invasion was a response to the declining state   of Native reservations and to the challenges faced by Seattle’s growing   urban Indian population, as well as the government’s apparent lack of   concern for either.
In this sense, the invasion was years in the making.
3] It was no coincidence that the reservations identified for termination were   also those with the most wealth and natural resources.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs  BIA  and the Indian Health   Service developed a concurrent Relocation policy that worked in tandem with   the policy of Termination to deprive Natives of government services.
Many   Natives found that living in the stagnant economy of the reservation had   become impossible without the financial aid of the federal government and so   moved to cities in order to gain access to burgeoning urban economies.
Seattle’s Native population rose from 700 in 1950 to more than 4,000 in   1970.
5] Under its Relocation policy, the federal government encouraged Natives to   migrate to cities and then ensured that once Indians left the reservation,   or the reservation was terminated, they were no longer under the   jurisdiction of the Tribal Governments or under the administrative authority   of the BIA.
In effect, Relocation nullified the federal government’s   longstanding treaty obligations and further decreased its commitment to   Native populations.
In doing so it dramatically reduced the amount of aid   the federal government was responsible for administering.
Thus the   government could wash its hands of Native reliance on federal programs and   funding.
As there were   no federal, state, county, or city funds available, Natives had to rely on   volunteer social services.
Most of these were provided by the American   Indian Women’s Service League, which operated out of an old church downtown.
6] A free health care clinic also operated three nights a week in space donated   by the Marine Public Health Hospital.
Volunteer doctors and nurses staffed   the clinic, utilizing donated pharmaceuticals stored in a lady’s restroom.
By the late sixties, the city of Seattle was at least marginally   aware of the need to address the problems of urban Indians.
In 1969, the   city assigned Blair Paul, a young University of Washington Law School   graduate who was working as a Seattle Human Rights Department officer, to   address the problem.
8] War on Poverty programs meant that millions of dollars were coming into   Seattle for minorities, but Indians were receiving none of these funds.
Neither the Service League nor Kinatechitapi, a Native American employment   assistance collective formed in 1969, were successful in securing any   federal funds.
Paul felt that in order for Natives to be successful in the   competition for public assistance funds floating around at the time they   needed to organize.
Natives were not well organized,” he recalls.
They   weren’t organized at all.
I was hired by the Department to focus on the   needs of urban Indians in Seattle.
The first thing I did was to organize a   meeting at Kinatechitapi.
10] The meeting, held in September 1969, proved to be a success because it   provided a forum for the emergence of new leadership.
According to Paul,  that is where Bernie Whitebear began to show his abilities.
And the next   two years with Bernie, it was full tilt to the wall.
An amazing, amazing   human being.
Born Bernie Reyes in the small Eastern Washington town of   Inchelium on September 27, 1937, Whitebear became aware of the problems facing urban Indians through first hand   experience.
He was by birth a member of the   Colville Confederated Tribe, an amalgamation of eleven different Plateau   bands – Colville, San Poil, Nespelem, Lakes, Southern Okanogan, Entiat,   Methow, Columbia, Wenatchi, Palus, and Nez Perce – created in 1872 under   executive order of President Grant.
He was also half Filipino, an ethnic mix   common enough that the term  Indipino  has entered the parlance of our time.
12] Whitebear often had difficulty finding work and was aware of the   racism that Indians faced in American cities.
As a young man living in   Tacoma, he fished the Puyallup River with his friend, Puyallup Native Bob   Saticum.
Both men were having trouble finding work and fishing was the one   source of livelihood that racist hiring practices could not restrict Indians   from engaging in.
In 1959 Whitebear began meeting regularly with   other Natives in Tacoma, usually at Indian taverns, to discuss the problems   they faced and possible solutions.
According to Whitebear’s brother and   biographer Lawney Reyes, “They spent most of their time drinking, talking,   and trying to solve all the world’s needs.
But Bernie knew that this was   only a shallow exercise.
In   1961 Whitebear moved to Seattle where he began organizing events to make   Native concerns more visible to the White population and also creating   cultural activities to help affirm traditional Native identity among urban   Indians.
He was aware of the political climate of Seattle during the mid to late sixties   and saw it as an opportunity to press Native grievances.
Seattle had the   Students of Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, United Black   Contractors, Vietnam War and United Farm Workers protestors,” he wrote.
14]   Whitebear was not alone in thinking it was time for Native people to be more   militant.
At Western Washington University, Randy Lewis, also a Colville,   was helping to establish the American Indian Student Union.
The hosted a   conference, The Right to be Indian Conference, “that drew together a lot of   people from throughout the nation,” Lewis recalls.
On November 20, dozens of young Native American activists   headed through San Francisco’s early morning fog toward the abandoned   Alcatraz penitentiary and forever changed the way Native Americans would   fight for their rights.
Among them were a number of Northwest Natives,   including Bernie Whitebear and Randy Lewis.
The activists who occupied   Alcatraz were for the most part young urban Indians who were either college   students or recent college graduates.
Their strategy was militant,   confrontational, direct-action, non-violent protest.
This was new in the   Indian community and contrasted with the strategy of older tribal government   officials, often referred to as “Uncle Tomahawks” by the new radical Indian   youth, who advocated a gradualist approach and held their leadership   positions through a perceived cozying up to non-Indian officials.
The youth   felt that they were being misrepresented by traditional leaders, and for the   first time utilized their voices and stood in numbers behind such spokesmen   as Clyde Warrior, who in testimony before the President’s Advisory   Commission on Rural Poverty in 1967 illustrated the dissatisfaction of   Indian youth: “We are not free.
We do not make choices.
Our choices are made   for us; we are the poor.
The Alcatraz occupation lasted nearly eighteen months and was   ultimately joined by over five thousand protesters.
The young activists   succeeded in capturing the attention of the national media and spotlighting   the plight of urban Indians.
Their ultimate goal was to establish a Native   American university and cultural center on Alcatraz Island.
Although   unsuccessful in this regard, their methods influenced and inspired   discontented and frustrated urban Indians around the country, including   Seattle.
Whitebear returned from Alcatraz with an even stronger   awareness of the need for a new, more radical approach in Seattle.
This   awareness was catalyzed in 1970 when Richard Nixon signed a bill into law,   introduced by Washington Senators Henry Jackson and Warren G.
Magnuson,   which enabled non-federal entities to obtain surplus federal lands for 0-50   percent of fair market value.
17] Under the new law, the city of Seattle was eligible to acquire Fort Lawton   at little to no cost.
But the city denied their requests and suggested that they   appeal to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Of course, the city knew that under   the policy of Relocation and Termination this would be pointless because the   BIA had no authority over urban Indians.
To Whitebear and his cohorts, the   city’s actions displayed a complete lack of regard for its Native   population.
18] Coming as it did on the heels of the Alcatraz occupation, Whitebear saw the   new law as an opportunity for political action.
In March of 1970, Whitebear was the   leader of a growing number of younger urban Indians who were tired of the   misrepresentation of the American Indian in Seattle politics and frustrated   by the city’s unwillingness to negotiate.
We felt he  Sen.
19]   Whitebear and the others felt the time was right to follow   the path of those who acted on Alcatraz and attempt to physically occupy   Fort Lawton.
21] Among those pledging assistance were National Indian Youth Council members Clyde   Warrior, Vine Deloria, Shirley Whithill, and fellow Colville Randy Lewis.
When it became clear that members from the Indians of All Tribes on Alcatraz   would be willing to help in the occupation of Fort Lawton, as would similar   groups from Canada led by George Abbot, the decision to act   was sealed.
Whitebear didn’t see the breaching of the Fort’s defenses and   gaining access to the area as much of an obstacle as he had spent plenty of   time training on the grounds as both a paratrooper and as a special forces   soldier, as did a Garry Brey another member of the invading group.
The night before the invasion, drawing on   the connections of his heritage, Whitebear organized a powwow at the   Filipino Community hall in south Seattle, both to celebrate the coming   operations and to communicate to as many people as possible the plans for   the invasion.
The efforts of the powwow were successful and on the   following morning, March 8, 1970, more than 100 participants mustered into   two half-mile long convoys and began the drive to opposite ends of the Fort.
26]   As the caravans drove towards the north and south ends of the Fort the   vehicles made no efforts to maintain operational security as vehicles   proudly displayed Native Pride banners from their aerials.
On the morning of March 8, 1970 more than one hundred   protesters scaled the fences on both the north and south ends of Fort   Lawton, draping blankets over the razor wire as they climbed over.
They   quickly set up tepees and drum circles and began singing traditional Native   songs.
A Reserve Military Police  MP  company completing its weekend   drilling was surprised by the invasion and, in turn, surprised the invaders.
We didn’t realize there were still soldiers on the base,” Randy Lewis said   later.
The MPs requested help from Fort Lewis and armed troops soon arrived   alongside squads of Seattle police officers.
With bolstered numbers they   descended on the occupiers and began marching or carrying them away through   a blackberry patch toward awaiting trucks.
People were injured, MPs were injured, equipment was   destroyed, jeeps were flipped over … barracks were torched.
We had kids,   little kids who came in with us who sought safety under some barracks and   the MPs didn’t know who was under there, just that some were under there so   they threw these … grenades in there.
Tear gas grenades and the kids threw   them back out.
This continued and finally the kids just torched the   barracks.
Lewis’s version is supported by Lawney Reyes in Reyes’s biography of his   brother, Bernie Whitebear.
At times tempers were lost and fighting broke   out,” Reyes writes.
The leaders Bernie had selected had to intervene more   than once to maintain order.
While the occupiers were removed from inside the fort, the   protest continued outside the gates.
Indeed, the demonstrators who gathered   en masse to continue the fight were a critical component of the invasion’s   success.
As Reyes recalls, “Outside the main gate of Fort Lawton, five   hundred Indians and non-Indian allies assembled to show their support to the   invading activists.
31] There is considerable debate over the actual numbers of protesters outside   the gates.
Some estimates claim hundreds of participants while others   remember the numbers ranging from fifty to ninety.
32] The protesters remained outside of the front gates for three weeks, thanks   in part to the support they received from community members who supplied the   vigil, which became known as “Resurrection City,” with food and clothing.
Hewlett’s Catering, owners of Tillicum Village, provided a catered meal each   day.
33] These protesters caused the Army such consternation that two active duty   companies were sent to Fort Lawton from Fort Lewis to install nearly one   mile of concertina wire around the entrance to prevent any further   invasions.
Despite the army’s new security measures, Indian leaders were   anxious to maintain their momentum and the interest of the press, as well as   to perhaps exorcise grudges over the rough treatment the protesters had   received on March 8.
The beatings we took were not going to be forgotten,”   said Lewis about the first invasion.
35] Consequently, a second invasion was planned to take place four days later.
The group found that the only viable access to the fort was from the least   likely of approaches, the water.
On March 12, complete with teepees, drums,   elderly persons, and children, the group infiltrated the south end of the   fort.
They scaled the large bluffs abutting the fort by clinging to the root   systems of the trees that grew out of the cliffs.
They also shrewdly timed   the foot patrols of the guards and were able to set up their teepees, build   a fire, and begin a drum circle in between the rotation of the sentries.
Randy Lewis remembers the reaction of the guard upon discovering the   invasion: “The next time he comes by he goes, what the hell!
There are a   hundred Indians over there drumming and singing.
36] The MPs soon descended once again, coming in force and in full riot gear.
Before they could see the MPs the occupiers heard the thumping of their   black jacks as they advanced in unison.
Lewis recounts climbing a ridge to   get a better look.
I was with Douglas Remington, who was a Ute Indian from   Utah of all places … We climbed this ridge and as far as the eye could see   there were MPs marching.
They crested the hill and we all figured this is   it.
37] This time the occupiers chose not fight back, but rather fell limp to the   ground in nonviolent resistance.
We didn’t want to risk the old people or   the Children,” Lewis said.
Still, they did not go easily.
38]   Eventually, the occupants were rounded up and once again taken to Fort   Lawton’s stockade.
While the city’s general population seemed to be behind the   Native group after the occupation, there was considerable dissent from   within the Native community.
After meeting with Army officials, Whitebear   and his group felt compelled to defend their actions to the Native elements   of the community who thought they were inappropriate and counterproductive.
During a meeting held at the Alaska Native Services building the invaders   were faced with strong opposition.
Much of it stemmed from the American   Indian Women’s Service League and especially its founder, Pearl Warren, who   felt that militant action would jeopardize the modest funding the city was   already granting to Natives.
39] Although   he himself was a militant activist, Randy Lewis regrets the divisions caused   by the invasion.
The old guard in the Service League in many ways felt they   were being ignored, resented, and even displaced.
Resurrection City remained   outside of the front gates of the fort for over three weeks, complete with   functional teepees and continuous demonstrations to block and complicate the   mission of the Army personnel attempting to operate in the area.
By the end   of March, Indian leaders faced a decision.
According to Lewis, “We had to   decide if we were going to stay or go, so we met again at the Filipino   Community Center and decided to call it quits on April 1st.
We decided to   take down Resurrection City the next day.
Everybody poo pooed him of course and   Frank was out there when we were holding our press conference and from up in   the sky … Frank had hired a sky writer and it says, ‘Surrender Ft.
41] As the teepees were being taken down about fifty Indians, accompanied by   television crews and cameras, rushed past the guards for a third and final   occupation on April 2, 1970.
42] The Natives scattered throughout the base while MPs began making immediate   arrests.
43] As Resurrection City came down and the trespassing Natives spent their last   night in Fort Lawton’s stockade, Whitebear announced the transition from   occupation to negotiation.
The most immediate success of the occupation of Fort Lawton was   the effect it had on public opinion.
45]   Perhaps even more important than local support was the support of   actress activist Jane Fonda, whose impact on public opinion, not only   locally but nationally and even internationally, cannot be understated.
Fonda, perhaps more than anyone else, got Bernie Whitebear through the door   and brought the politicians to the bargaining table.
46] “She broadcast that face and that Barbarella body,” said Lewis of Fonda’s   involvement.
While she did little at the actual occupation her leverage and   media presence granted Whitebear and others the foothold they needed to   begin the bargaining process for the land they desired.
Whitebear was advised by attorneys Garry Bass and Blair Paul   to form an organization that could be seen as representative of the Natives   in Seattle during the negotiations to come.
The new organization was named   the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation and was sponsored by the   National Congress of American Indians, the largest Indian organization in   the United States at the time, in addition to more than forty non-Indian   organizations throughout King County.
47] This level of public support enabled a UIATF committee to gain an audience   with BIA commissioner Louis Bruce.
The committee,  consisting of Whitebear,   Randy Lewis, Dr.
Frances Svensson and others, successfully convinced Bruce   to place a hold on Fort Lawton lands, thereby preserving their status as   “surplus” federal land, until further negotiations could be completed.
Bruce   was later pressured politically by the Department of the Interior to remove   the hold because it represented a breach of the BIA’s policy of refusing to   deal with urban Indians.
48] In the meantime, the hold meant that the city could not acquire the land.
The temporary hold enabled the UIATF to make an application   for part of the property prior to the city of Seattle’s application through   the Department of the Interior.
This early application put the UIATF on   equal ground with the city of Seattle in the eyes of the General Services   Administration, which was responsible for final disposal of federal surplus   property.
The early application reportedly enraged Mayor Uhlman, who had   been lobbying for the property for years.
49] The move, in conjunction with pressure from Senator Jackson, forced Uhlman   to negotiate with the UIATF.
Senator Jackson was at the time a candidate for   the Democratic presidential nomination.
As one negotiator pointed out to the Seattle Post Intelligencer, “Jackson turned on the Heat.
Negotiations started in June of 1971 and were not completed   until November when it was agreed that the UIATF would lease twenty acres   for a 99-year period with options for successive 99-year leases without   renegotiation.
The agreement was approved, executed and incorporated on   March 29, 1972 and the surplus land was transferred on August 30.
51]   Bernie Whitebear was sure to refer to the agreement as anything but a   treaty: “it’s not a treaty.
The white man doesn’t keep treaties.
With the agreement reached, the next task was to develop the   program for the cultural center, to design the buildings, and to seek funds   for their construction.
In March of 1973 the city of Seattle designated   $500,000 of its general revenue sharing funds for the development of the   cultural center.
An additional grant of $250,000 was awarded from the   Economic Development Administration  EDA .
Both the city and the EDA later   contributed more funds to the project in addition to the timber the UIATF   received form the Colville, Quinault, and Makah Tribes.
2 million.
53] With the funding for the center secured, the groundbreaking occurred on   September 27, 1975.
Eighteen months later, on May 13, 1977, the building,   which Lawney Reyes helped design, was dedicated.
The invasion of Fort Lawton was not a total victory.
The   activists had hoped to secure all ten thousand acres of surplus land and in   the end received only forty.
54] And the militant nature of the protest caused dissension within Seattle’s   Indian community along generational lines.
Yet in other important respects   the invasion was a momentous success.
Alongside the Alcatraz takeover, it   signaled to the city of Seattle and the nation that urban Indians would   fight for rights, redress, and respect by any means necessary.
In this way,   it is inseparable from other radical movements for social justice and civil   rights involving persons of color, women, and the working-class that have   defined the period between the late 1960s and mid 1970s.
The invasion also   resulted in the formation of the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, a   crucial institutional body that continues to unify the Native community   across diverse tribal affiliations.
Equally important, the Daybreak Star   Center filled, and continues to fill, a vital place in Seattle’s Native   community as both a provider of essential social services and a preserver of   Native history and culture.
The UIATF named the center Daybreak Star after a   vision by Black Elk, a Sioux medicine man.
The   four colors symbolize the four races of mankind united in four directions …   spiritually, physically, mentally and emotionally.

SEATTLE -- After a demotion to captain that lasted all of two months, Nick Metz has been reinstated as assistant chief at the Seattle Police Department, according to a Jan.
29 announcement by Interim Chief Harry Bailey.
Metz had been bumped down to captain by previous Interim Chief Jim Pugel in November.
As assistant chief under Bailey, who was picked by new Mayor Ed Murray to replace Pugel earlier this month, Metz will head the Field Support Bureau.
The Jan.
29 announcement also revealed shakeups at the precinct level.
Capt.
Chris Fowler will replace Capt.
Jim Dermody as head of the West Precinct, which includes Downtown Seattle.
Capt.
Pierre Davis will replace the recently instated Capt.
Mike Edwards as head of the East Precinct.
And, Capt.
Steve Wilske will replace Capt.
Joe Kessler in the Southwest Precinct.
In addition, the Professional Standards Bureau is now the Compliance and Professional Standards Bureau and includes Compliance Office staff, the Education & Training Section, the Audit, Policy & Research Section, and the new Force Investigations Unit.
The Special Operations Bureau has been divided into Special Operations and Homeland Security bureaus, as per the announcement.
I do not know the specifics of Cpt.
Metz  case.
That said, I don t think it s appropriate to comment on it.
But I do have one observation.
I find it odd that the Seattle branch of the NAACP does not have any comment regarding SPD s personnel shakeup.
They re usually quite vocal of issues within the SPD.
I can tell you that I lived in a duplex andÂ Jim Pugel was my landlord for 14 years.
Oh , well go be Assistant Captain for a while .
Geez how many Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs, Captains and Assistant Capts.
It will take another hired Assistant Chief to keep some kind of Â tally.
I live outside of Seattle so I really don t give a rip what they do but I m sure their decisions influence nearby areas.
The good old boys of the Guild!
Is anyone steering this ship?
How much of this is due toÂ  federal oversight helping SPD improve?
So, basically, you call out the Feds for corruption, and you get shafted.
THey are members of SP Management Association.
Wait until you see who they replaced SPOG s O Neill with.
NW observer Â This is what happens, I guess, when you clean out  just some  of the dust bunnies and hairballs from under the rug.
Is interesting to observe though and will be even more interesting to see whom the elite present and vote in as a new police chief.
Tuesday , it s Seattle so it should be easy to figure it out.

For three decades, photographer Robert Semeniuk has documented the pain and strength of ordinary people around the world.
This 1994 picture of a young Palestinian boy playing soldier is part of Semeniuk s series on children and war.
Maputo, 1996 | In Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, street children live off the torn city s garbage and sleep in shelled-out condemned buildings.
At worst, they are dangerous urban predators; each has a long history of abuse.
Many were child soldiers, rounded up by the guerrilla organization RENAMO and forced to commit atrocities during an extended civil war.
At best, they are innocent bystanders caught in horrors few understand.
Gaza City, 1994 |  Palestinian children play a game they call Arabs & Jews,  Robert Semeniuk says.
They mimic what they saw every day in the intifada,  the uprising of Palestinians against Israeli rule.  Doctors at the Gaza Community Mental Health Program call this post-traumatic play.
India, 1988 | A boy waits on the platform of the train station in Madras, India, selling dried coconut to train passengers.
Hundreds of thousands of people live along the tracks in India, scrounging a living off the passengers and scrabbling for garbage.
Cambodia, 1996 | Land-mine victim Kanh Soma, 36, lies in pain at Battambang Civilian Hospital in Cambodia.
Soma, injured by a homemade anti-personnel land mine, is one of hundreds of people maimed or killed by land mines each month in Cambodia.
Semeniuk says.
In the trenches during Burma s civil war in 1987, Semeniuk got up close and personal with child soldiers and the putrid smell of death.
Inuit, 1976  |  Semeniuk photographed Inuit caribou hunters as they stopped for tea on the ice of North  Baffin Island in the eastern Arctic.
Though they live half a world away, they seem familiar in Semeniuk s pictures because he immerses himself in their lives, showing us  family dynamics and how people are connected to their land,  says Jason Houston of Orion magazine.
When Semeniuk was on assignment for National Geographic in the 1970s, he lived with Inuit hunters in the Arctic for two years, documenting the impact of modern life on these aboriginal people.
The Inuit have been among the first to be hard hit by global warming as permafrost and ice caps melt, damaging hunting and a culture based on snow and ice.
Ethiopia, 2006  |  Keddr Mengi, 45, has returned to Sister Genet Bogala s clinic to have stitches removed after surgery to correct the painful effects of trachoma, a highly infectious eye disease that can lead to blindness.
Ethiopia, 2006  |   Sister Bogala performs tracoma surgery on Sherefa Ali, 30, while Keddr Mengi, 45, waits outside for his turn with the field nurse.
Nearly 2,600 such surgeries were performed in the Gurage district of Ethiopia in a recent 10-month period, Semeniuk says.
Botswana, 2005  |  Lennah Nanke Mothimit, 38,  right  visits with her sister, Anna, in Botswana in 2005.
Nanke contracted AIDS in 1999 from a rapist.
One of the few women in D Kar who is open about her HIV status, she is estranged from her mother, ostracized by the church and abandoned by the fathers of her children.
In spring of 2005, Semeniuk pitched his tent next to her shack for several weeks, documenting AIDS and dislocation among the San Bushmen of the Kalahari, who have a 40 percent HIV-infection rate.
Afghanistan, 1996  | In Kabul, 9-year-old Wazir Hammond requires prosthesis refittings every six months as he grows.
He rests against a wall of sandbags that protect the local hospital against rockets, shelling and bombs.
In 1996, an estimated  10 million land mines polluted nearly 500 square kilometres of land in Afghanistan.
This picture was part of Semeniuk s five-year project on land mines.
Somalia, 1992  |  In a shot-out warehouse in Kismayo, a withered young woman with two dying children tells Semeniuk she is afraid to accept food because  the people with guns come and kill us for it.  She walked here for more than a week, with no food, hoping to find some, and there was none.
Whether he s headed for Angola, the Arctic, Oman, Beirut, Myanmar or Somalia, it takes Robert Semeniuk only 10 minutes to pack.
Everything fits in a stowable roll-a-board and a rucksack: his pup tent; three  70s-era Canon F-1 metal camera bodies tough enough to hammer nails; three lenses; dozens of rolls of Fuji  Velveeta  slide film shucked of plastic canisters and stowed in Ziploc bags; a few nondescript shirts and pants; a tattered nylon photographer s vest; Keens and running shoes; dog-eared family photos of his 12-year-old daughter, Raya, and his wife, the accomplished musician Ruta Yawney; checkered keffiyeh scarves to swaddle gear and pad camera straps so they won t chafe his neck.
58-year-old says,  the less equipment I need.  In a perfect world, Semeniuk wouldn t lug any gear at all.
It s really about the relationship with the people.
He always shoots on manual.
Film, not digital.
Doesn t carry a light meter.
Stopped using them years ago when his camera s internal meter broke and he realized he understood the light on his own.
Doesn t bother with mosquito repellent or malaria prophylaxis  except in antibiotic-resistant areas  because he s already survived a dozen bouts of malaria and dengue.
Long ago, while photographing Chinese Indian military operations in Tibet, he cut his foot on glass and had to stitch it without anesthetic or antiseptic, instead relying on raw garlic to cleanse the wound.
These days, the photographer totes a medical kit containing heavy pain killers and sutures.
He usually buys a mosquito net and cooking pots in situ, then gives them away before returning home.
Many of the causes he s long championed are just now becoming chic as global health and global poverty surface in the collective consciousness.
He s a photographer with ancient equipment, ahead of his time.
Global warming?
The Inuit of the Arctic are now among the first cultures hard hit by global warming.
In the 1970s, Semeniuk lived with Inuit hunters for two years on assignment for National Geographic, documenting the impact of modern life on aboriginal people.
He never mentions how cold it was, only the people.
They live on that edge of what s habitable in the world.
Land mines?
Even before the International Campaign to Ban Landmines won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997, Semeniuk delved into the issue, spending five years with amputees and de-mining experts in Mozambique, Cambodia and Afghanistan.
It s amazing, Semeniuk says, how deplorable becomes normal when people have no other choice.
He recalls barefoot children in Memba, Mozambique, playing soccer on a mined field even though several youngsters had already been injured there.
Children of war?
Semeniuk was in the trenches with kid soldiers in the Burmese jungle back in 1986, two years before a military crackdown killed more than 10,000 protesters.
A few years later, he explored war trauma on the psyches of Palestinian children growing up in the Gaza Strip.
He was on the ground in lawless Somalia before UN peacekeepers arrived, when the rest of the world had eyes only for Yugoslavia s demise and ignored the African crisis.
Semeniuk s current epic is a years-long personalization of world health issues.
In spring of 2005, he pitched his tent next to the shack of a single mom in Botswana, documenting AIDS and dislocation among the San Bushmen of the Kalahari, who have a 40 percent HIV-infection rate.
He spent last fall in Ethiopia photographing suffering caused by trachoma, a disease borne by flies, which is the world s leading cause of preventable blindness.
Future segments will focus on malaria among the war displaced in Burma; diabetes among Canada s First Nations people; tuberculosis in Russian prisons; obesity in America; river blindness; snail fever; elephantiasis.
Why global health?
I ve spent my whole life traveling around to places where it was mostly poor people,  Semeniuk says.  And most poor people are  dis-eased  from many perspectives.
The first time I saw a land-mine victim in Burma, 1987, a Karen  hill tribe  kid, he ended up dying from malaria.
I thought,  Jesus.
Semeniuk s pictures have been used by nongovernmental organizations including the United Nations and World Health Organization, published in newspapers and magazines worldwide, featured in 15 solo exhibitions.
Dan Lamont, a Seattle-based photojournalist and board member of Blue Earth Alliance, a nonprofit that supports photographic projects on threatened cultures and environments, including Semeniuk s world-health work.
Semeniuk hasn t been discovered big-time because he s Canadian, Lamont believes, and also because the photographer gravitates to complexity rather than headlines.
His subjects may be dramatic, but they re not necessarily the cause du jour.
They re the back story.
There s a lot of need to cover the story that leads to the bad things that happen.
Three Inuit hunters, their caribou suits frosted by wind, recline on Arctic ice taking their tea.
So foreign, this shivery setting, but their body language looks familiar, as if they were neighbors sprawled in the living room watching a movie.
These hunters live on the other side of an enormous cultural chasm, yet seeing them through Semeniuk s eyes, you feel a connection.
Next, the Somalian children in a shot-out Kismayo warehouse.
Their bony limbs and withered skin make you flinch, no surprise.
But what makes you weep is the tenderness with which the starving brother holds the fragile baby, the sweet curve of their cheeks, the lingering human touch.
Their mother warns Semeniuk not to leave food because people with guns would come and kill them for it.
Then there s Nanke.
Nanke and her sister Anna in front of Nanke s scrappy tin shack in the slanting light of early morning, jawing about their kids, their no-good men, the mother and church that abandoned them after they contracted AIDS.
Their people, the San in Botswana, have been forced from their desert homeland and resettled into camps they call  places of death.  The upheaval is at the root of surging alcoholism, malaria, TB and AIDS.
Semeniuk stayed with Nanke for more than two months.
It became a problem when she wanted me to buy her booze.
Nanke, I understand where you re coming from, but I won t contribute to your alcoholism.
She made her own cheap beer out of sorghum to sell, so by 3 in the afternoon, she always managed to be drunk.
Frankly, I thought it was a really appropriate response to her situation.
In Semeniuk s photo, a cast-off beer bottle rests in the rippled sand; Anna listens intently to her sister, chin cocked; the laundry has been folded.
Everyday life in extenuating circumstances.
Small moments in a vast landscape.
This is Semeniuk s forte.
It takes time, and you have to be present,  says Gary Fiegehen, a Canadian photographer who has also done work with First Nations and who, with Semeniuk, helped found On the Ground, a nonprofit that supports documentary projects.  If you re going to get to know them, they have to get to know you.
Semeniuk immerses himself in stories, living with a family, sharing chores, eating what they eat  raw seal blubber, steaming caribou marrow .
He shares family photos and trades parenting tales.
He tells about past hurts: his brother s suicide; the time his best friend got his girlfriend pregnant.
Sometimes, he doesn t take out his camera for two weeks.
Jason Houston, picture editor at Orion, a nonprofit magazine that published Semeniuk s Inuit photos in May.
If you re trying to make a living as a photographer, it s a lot safer to photograph things people expect.
He shows the temporary tents they live in when they re hunting on the ice and the more established towns you never see portrayed.
Balding, with smudged glasses and a papa-bear paunch, Semeniuk could easily pass for a government bureaucrat  which he briefly was  or a pre-teen dancer s proud dad  which he is  or a missionary  he s not, but African villagers have told him he looks like one .
Certain days, you might even mistake Semeniuk for a casually dressed stockbroker, a thought that horrifies him; he ll rant about that later on.
Semeniuk grew up in Big Valley, Alberta, a village of 350 people,  the redneck capital of Canada,  he says.
Cowboys and oil.
Half-ton truck with an Easy Rider Rifle on the rack.
His father was mayor, chairman of the School Board, hotel owner, insurance salesman, rockhound.
His mother ran the hotel, painted and did pottery.
Now 85, Vera Semeniuk recalls her son, the third of four children, as determined and a perfectionist.
Growing up in the hotel, the children met all sorts.
In our house,  Vera says,  it didn t matter who you were or what religion, how old, or what color.
Semeniuk s family moved to Edmonton when he was in high school.
He was a good student with a wild streak.
The highlight of his teen years was a two-week road trip to Tijuana, Mexico, with three friends.
They picked up hitchhikers, hookers, Hell s Angels.
They told their parents they d gone to Okanagan.
He wanted more.
After graduating from college, Semeniuk earned a master s degree from Toronto s York University in environmental studies  cultural ecology  and human geography, doing his fieldwork mainly with the Inuit in Igloolik.
C.
C.
There, in 1976, he visited National Geographic s headquarters.
He showed his Inuit photographs; they offered a two-year contract.
Semeniuk has been a freelance photographer, essayist and advocate ever since, a career that enables his lifelong  love affair with anxiety.  He worries a lot about money, especially since the freelance rate hasn t changed in a decade, yet there s no other vocation he d consider.
In person, Semeniuk is not the quietly contemplative guy his work would suggest.
He broods, rants, curses.
He s also charming, provocative, utterly honest and preoccupied with injustice.
He cries often.
Does he not publish in some of these same magazines?
I am as much in the cesspool as anybody else,  he says.  If you read a newspaper, you re guilty of chopping down the forest.
People either really like Bob or they are repelled by him.
He s kind of the noble bard, telling it the way it is, and he doesn t care who he offends in the process,  says Steve Smith, a biologist and former wilderness guide in the Canadian Arctic.  He carries the world s sorrows on his shoulders.
Smith recalls how Semeniuk s enthusiasm spread when their tour group stumbled upon a dead beluga whale that had washed ashore.
Its skin, maqtaq, is an Inuit delicacy.
Bob jumped up with his pocket knife and started cutting off little pieces of skin and blubber, eating on the spot and coaxing everybody to try some.
Bob travels around the world and sees a great deal of suffering.
There were a number of occasions when I had to tell him to put his camera down and hide it.
What I remember most is his curiosity, an empathy.
We saw people who were starving, children who were injured.
I, as a surgeon, have to have a certain amount of detachment.
So I told him: This child will probably die.
Off the coast of British Columbia, after everyone else had gone to bed on the research boat, Semeniuk and biologist Tom Reimchen would sip brandy and talk about economic systems, environmental contaminants, land mines.
The David Suzuki Foundation had hired Semeniuk to document Reimchen s research on bears dragging salmon carcasses into the Great Bear Rainforest.
Reimchen recalls an evening at a lodge that had agreed to let the researchers use its bear-viewing platforms to observe the night-feeding grizzlies.
The lodge served dinner family style, Reimchen s research team seated alongside wealthy paying guests.
How are your  stock  shares doing today?
The person next to Bob mentioned a company that was a major exporter of land mines.
He stands up and launches into a five- or 10-minute tirade, an extremely eloquent but very dark analysis of their personalities, basically characterizing them as the lowlife of the planet, people who didn t care whether companies made land mines or dog food.
I can t tell for sure whether Bob was angry before he started venturing to the living hells of the world, or after.
Every afternoon, Semeniuk and his Belgian sheep dog-border collie, Luna, walk the shore of Bowen Island, gleefully ignoring the  No Trespass  signs of property owners.
Semeniuk carps about the malicious influence of Rambo in the Philippines among vigilantes armed with M-16s who cut off heads at roadblocks in the name of democracy.
Man and dog scramble over huge granite boulders covered with moss.
I take it all personally.
When you kill babies, I take that personally.
When you rape women, I take that personally,  he says.  The budget for world health is 2 percent of what was spent on the military last year.
The world should be up and screaming over that, and they re not.
How do you motivate people out of their apathy?
It s too easy to change a channel, drift off, everybody making money.
Salty waves gently roll smooth rocks.
Even here, in the most peaceful of environments, Semeniuk can t let go of the world s horrors.
Vipassana meditation helped for a while, he says,  but like anything else, when you start feeling better, you stop doing it.  The photographer laughs, but just for a moment.
He s focused on something else, far away, something only he can see.

The St.
Louis Business Journal is showing its readers snippets of the weekly Domain Tech Report, which is produced by Techli, a St.
Louis-based startup that came to town after it received a $50,000 Arch Grant in 2012.
The Domain Tech Report is hosted by entrepreneur Ed Domain , who interviews a variety of St.
Louis-based startup founders, investors or others who play a role in the innovation community.
This week, Domainâ€™s guest is St.
Louis Mayor Francis Slay .
Slay said startups and entrepreneurs have been the backbone of the St.
Louis community since it was founded.
He cited breweries, shoe makers and frozen custard makers.
Slay said city officials started thinking about how it could help nurture startup companies in St.
Louis around 2001 when they were looking to help build on the ideas being created in St.
Louis, and, in particular, the Center for Emerging Technologies.
We wanted to turn them into profitable businesses and help them grow and employ people,â€� Slay said.

Breach of Faith — Los Angeles Times; Jeff Gottlieb, Ruben Vives, Kim Christensen, Hector Becerra, Corina Knoll, Robert J.
Judges  comments: At a time when many news  organizations are pulling back and reducing coverage of outlying cities, The Los Angeles Times uncovered a story  of incredible greed in one of the state’s poorest towns, Bell.
Fighting hard  for the records to prove it, the Times put 11 reporters on the story and found that the Bell town government had  bilked its 39,000 residents of millions of dollars in outlandishly high  salaries and property taxes, even as the town cut services and laid off  workers.
Taxpayers were unknowingly forking over $800,000 for the city manager,  $376,000 for an assistant city manager, $457,000 for the police chief and  $100,000 for part-time council members.
9 million in  overpaid taxes and fees.

Judges  comments: Jeff Testerman and John Martin  uncovered an exceptionally brazen fake charity scheme that had collected  millions of dollars in the name of veterans and funneled money to conservative  politicians across the nation.
S.
Navy Veterans Association  was far less than it seemed.
The association claimed offices in 41 states and  nearly 67,000 members.
But despite an elaborate website and what appeared to be  a national board of directors, the newspaper could find no evidence of anybody – except the group’s founder, who called himself Lt.
Commander Bobby Thompson.
Even  his name was phony.
He’s now on the lam.
As a result of the series, federal  authorities are investigating, and an Ohio grand jury has returned indictments  against “Thompson,” alleging theft, racketeering and money laundering.
Judges  comments: The  Seattle Times revealed the tragic problems that evolved from an effort to give frail  Washington residents an alternative to nursing homes – and save the state  money.
As Michael J.
Berens discovered, it has resulted in thousands of elderly  people being exploited and abused in a booming “adult home” industry.
In this  series of well-focused stories, Berens uncovered 236 previously unknown deaths  from causes indicating neglect or abuse.
He profiled elderly residents drugged  and suffering excruciating injuries at the hands of amateur caregivers.
He  noted business owners went so far as to list frail residents as commodities for  sale.
The series led to the demotion of a state official who oversaw the  facilities and reforms, including a requirement that home operators publicly  post inspections.
Judges  comments: In a three-year investigation, The Las Vegas Sun did what the government could not achieve in eight  years: Identify and publicly report preventable injuries and infection in Las  Vegas hospitals.
9 million records  finding 396 deaths, over 2000 infections from superbugs, and over 700 injuries  due to surgical accidents.
Before this report, Nevadans could learn more about  the odds of a slot machine than the quality of care from a local hospital.
Within weeks of publication, some hospitals began revealing their own  information publicly.
Then lawmakers proposed three new laws and regulators  began investigating under-reporting by hospitals.

John  showed the entire industry has been based on lies – about why there is a  crisis, where the money is going and whether homeowners are even protected  against catastrophe.
Pushing back against an industry that hired PR firms to  attack the story, St.
John revealed how it created a bogus computer model to  predict catastrophic hurricane strikes so insurers could hike premiums and how  more than 100,000 homes are insured by companies so financially unstable they likely  couldn’t cover a house fire, let alone a hurricane.
As a result of these  stories, insurance companies have been ordered to rewrite contracts and return  millions of dollars to policyholders.
Eight competing newspapers cited St.
John’s stories in calling for changes in state legislation.
Some already  passed, with promises of more on the way.
Judges  comments: Showing it never hurts to tell a  story with humor, even in a financial investigation, this informative piece by  freelancer Aram Roston and Observer reporters Reid Pillifant and Azi Paybarah details how New York City’s mayor is  encouraging city residents to invest and pay taxes, but has millions of his own  dollars tucked away in off-shore tax shelters.
The judges commend the reporters  for finding and obtaining the documentation about the mayor s investments.

Judges  comments: Hundreds of thousands of Americans go to sleep  each night with a hidden time bomb ticking under their beds: faulty gas lines.
Sometimes those lines explode, killing or injuring the unsuspecting victims  above.
Such was the case time and time again in Texas where faulty gas lines  running under residential neighborhoods exploded with no warning.
Reporter  Brett Shipp, producer Mark Smith, editor photographer Billy Bryant and news  director Michael Valentine spent four years finding and documenting a lack of  regulatory oversight of gas lines across the state, even interviewing officials  who couldn’t say where the pipes were buried.
The multipart series forced state  officials to order the oil and gas industry to spend $1 billion to dig up and  replace aging lines and couplings.

Judges  comments: Superbly executed, this project  holds government accountable for grossly inflated claims of job growth in  Indiana.
Reporter Bob Segall, producer Cyndee Hebert and photojournalist Bill  Ditton spent 18 months and logged 8,000 miles traversing Indiana in search of  these jobs.
With great editing and clear, precise writing, they disclosed their  findings – not scores of new workers, but cornfields and abandoned factories.
This is shoe-leather reporting at its best, terrific mapping and use of  graphics, great building of databases, and terrific use of sound and standups.
Following the series, officials acknowledged the inflated job claims and  promised greater transparency and disclosure of public documents.

This is shoe-leather reporting at its best, terrific mapping and use of  graphics, great building of databases, and terrific use of sound and standups.
Following the series, officials acknowledged the inflated job claims and  promised greater transparency and disclosure of public documents.
Judges  comments: This story revealed a  little-known insurance tactic that deprived death benefits to the families of  dead soldiers.
Insurance companies provided “checkbooks” to family members  instead of a lump-sum death benefit.
The companies did not reveal that they  were actually keeping that money to earn hundreds of millions of dollars.
Even  state regulators didn’t realize these “checkbooks” provided no federal  protection as is commonly available through a regular bank account.
The project  includes stunning work with fully original reporting and immediate impact.
Within 24 hours of publication, the VA opened a probe of its own insurance  practices, and New York’s attorney general launched a major fraud  investigation.
Six weeks after the story, the VA changed its policy, requiring  one company to pay lump-sum benefits.
Congress passed a bill in October  requiring full disclosure by the VA and insurers of how death benefits are  invested.
More Congressional investigations are under way.
Judges  comments: Laura Sullivan pushed way beyond  the headlines to reveal who and what is behind the controversial Arizona  immigration law.
While most news outlets focused on the consequences of the  bill that allowed police to lock up anyone they stop who cannot show proof of  legal residency, NPR s investigation went behind the scenes.
It shows how the  private prison industry, which has much to gain, and the American Legislative  Council Exchange, a conservative organization, actually drafted model legislation and  lobbied for the law.
The judges thought NPR s decision to look at the law as a  new business model made this entry the overwhelming winner in the category.
Judges  comments: Fields did a masterful job,  explaining why there is a widely disparate dialysis treatment system in our country,  one that costs taxpayers billions and yet too often, provides inferior,  damaging care.
She was able to explain complicated medical issues and put  numbers into context.
She battled for the data and documents against government  and corporate interference.
After 27 months of persistent public records  requests, ProPublica was able to put together a geographically searchable  database that any of the 400,000 patients in this country on dialysis can use  to compare care.

Medicare and  Medicare Services about clinic conditions and the lack of effective regulatory  oversight.
This story is a great public service.

Judges  comments: From Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish  market to the tuna boats working the waters off the coast of Montpellier,  France, this sweeping report involved 18 reporters working in nine countries  chronicling the $4 billion black-market bluefin tuna business.
Reporters found  a system working under the radar to harvest fish against international  practices, doctoring numbers to appease regulators, and trading tuna off the  books in the countries where it brings the highest value.
The reports employed  records from 10 countries, including legal briefs, corporate reports and  databases used by regulators to track the trade.
Using print, online and  broadcast distribution, the series pointed to one of the largest illegal  empires in the world, tying together evidence across the globe that might not  have been connected otherwise.
The series attracted attention worldwide,  initiating reforms in both the international body that regulates Atlantic tuna  fishing and in individual countries that fish for tuna.
Judges  comments: This follow-up on The Seattle Times’ original Pulitzer  Prize Breaking News coverage of the killing of four police officers in a  Seattle suburb is a darkly fascinating tale of the man behind the killings and  the system that failed to keep him behind bars.
Reporters traced Maurice  Clemmons’ criminal history to his teen incarceration in Arkansas and the many  years he spent in and out of prison, growing more angry and resentful of  society.
Using more than 100 hours of recorded phone calls, records from the  prison systems citing Clemmons’ inability to improve himself, and documents  showing a series of officials who repeatedly arrested and released Clemmons  without regard for what he might do while free, the reporting slowly brought  the reader back to the Washington state crimes with a much better understanding  of how they could have happened.
In the end, the multipart account is as  riveting as any crime novel, leaving the reader wishing it were just a piece of  fiction instead of being a terrifying, real-life story of madness and mayhem.
The Hidden Life of Guns — The Washington Post; David S.
Fallis, James V.
Grimaldi, Sari Horwitz, Cheryl W.
Judges  comments: For the extensive use of FOIA but  also for finding a way around its exemptions, The Washington Post is awarded the 2010 IRE FOIA Medal.
In 2003,  Congress created an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act.
It cut off the  release of data tying a gun used in a crime to the store or dealer who first  sold it.
That didn’t stop the Post from doing it the hard way, with public-record requests to state governments  which gathered data on more than 35,000 guns traced to crimes, which were then  assembled into lists of top gun dealers.
The Post also put together the first  comprehensive database showing 511 police officers killed by firearms.
The  facts were chilling – for instance, just one gun store sold more than 2,500  guns recovered in crimes in the Washington area.
This well-written story  detailed the very real consequences of inattentiveness and political influence  peddling.
The reaction to the story was immediate.
The Obama Administration  announced an emergency implementation of a rule that would require reporting  bulk sales of assault weapons at the Mexican border, and a grand jury was  convened in Texas to investigate one of the retailers highlighted by the Post.
Judges  comments: A student reporter at the  University of Memphis’ Daily Helmsman,  Chelsea Boozer did what journalists do:  Question authority, scrap for refused public records and then stand up for the  defenseless.
Boozer tapped into a difficult and under-covered topic on campus:  how student fees were spent.
She shined a light on the perks of student  government leaders, including their paid tuition, parking and stipends, all  funded by a mandatory student activity fee.
Her digging found budgets tapped  for student travel and T-shirts for the student senate.
Her efforts forced a  student senator to be dismissed.
Student leaders now post their budget publicly.

Judges  comments: This project took an  eight-country team of reporters nine months to complete.
It discovered that a  global network of industry groups has spent nearly $100 million since the 1980s  to keep asbestos – a known killer banned or restricted in 52 countries – on the  market.
This investigation was done in countries where public records are hard  to get, including China and India.
Legal and corporate documents, scientific  papers and budgets had to be translated and the numbers crunched.
The  statistics are more than impressive: 200 people interviewed in eight countries,  a BBC documentary released in multiple languages, and 150 countries that  received coverage from 250 outlets, blogs and websites in 20 languages.
The  project’s impact has been far-reaching.
The Leader of the Opposition in the  Canadian House of Commons has called for an end to Canada’s exports, and an  Internet campaign resulted in 7,000 letters, many calling on Quebec to cut off  loan guarantees to its only remaining asbestos mine.
Brain Wars — ProPublica and National Public Radio; T.
Judges  comments: ProPublica’s extraordinary  efforts to obtain previously obfuscated data and then transform it into a  dataset the public can use represents an outstanding  investigation and public service.
Each drug company had its own way of making  it difficult to track doctor payments.
ProPublica cracked each and carefully  melded the mix so that patients anywhere in the country can see whether their  doctor is collecting money from a pharmaceutical company, and for which drug.
ProPublica went the extra step to teach journalists around the country how to  use the embeddable searchable interface to do their own stories.
Truly  innovative, the work represents the best media can do for the public good.

Flint is the largest city and county seat of Genesee County in the State of Michigan .
It is located along the Flint River , 66 miles  106 km  northwest of Detroit .
According to the 2010 census , Flint has a population of 102,434, making it the seventh largest city in Michigan .
Flint is the largest city in the Flint Tri-Cities region of Michigan.
7]  Genesee County comprises the entirety of Flint s metropolitan area , the fourth largest metropolitan area in Michigan with a population of 425,790 in 2010.
Founded as a village by fur trader Jacob Smith in 1819, Flint became a major lumbering area on the historic Saginaw Trail during the 19th century, and incorporated as a city in 1855.
In 1908, William Crapo Durant formed General Motors in Flint, and it was later the home of the Flint Sit-Down Strike of 1936–37 that played a vital role in the formation of the United Auto Workers , and eventually became an automobile manufacturing powerhouse .
However, by the late 1980s the city sank into a deep economic depression after GM closed and demolished several factories in the area, the effects of which remain today.
In the mid-2000s, it became known for its high crime rates.
10] Since this time, Flint has been continually ranked among the  Most Dangerous Cities in the United States , with a per capita violent crime rate seven times higher than the national average.
11] It has also been in a state of financial emergency since 2011, the second in a decade.
Regardless of the validity of this claim, the region was home to several Ojibwa tribes at the start of the 19th century, with a particularly significant community established near present-day Montrose.
The Flint River had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of arrowheads and burial mounds near it.
In 1819, Jacob Smith, a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwas and the territorial government, along with his Ojibwe wife founded a trading post in Flint itself.
S.
Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children.
As the ideal stopover on the overland route between Detroit and Saginaw , Flint grew into a small but prosperous village, and incorporated in 1855.
S.
Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan s 750,000.
In the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry.
Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry.
As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry.
Buick Motor Company , after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint.
AC Spark Plug  now part of Delphi   originated in Flint.
These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the Dort , Little , Flint , and Mason brands.
And Chevrolet s first  and for many years, main  manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit.
For a brief period, all Chevrolets and Buicks were built in Flint.
In 1904, local entrepreneur William C.
Durant was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908.
In 1908, Durant founded General Motors , filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint.
GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.
13] Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime.
On the first occasion, he befriended Louis Chevrolet and founded Chevrolet , which was a runaway success.
He used the capital from this success to buy back share control.
He later lost decisive control again, permanently.
Durant experienced financial ruin in the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.
The city s mayors were targeted for recall twice, Mayor David Cuthbertson in 1924 and Mayor William H.
McKeighan in 1927.
Recall supporters in both cases were jailed by the police.
Cuthbertson had angered the KKK, by the appointment of a Catholic police chief, who lead the recall effort and supported Judson Transue, Cutbertson s elected successor.
Transue how ever did not remove the police chief.
McKeighan survived his recall only to face conspiracy charges in 1928.
14] McKeighan was under investigation for a multitude of crimes and ticked off the rest of the city leaders that they pushed for changes in the city charter.
In 1929, the city adopted a new city charter with a council-manager form of government.
So, McKeighan ran the  Green Slate  of candidates who won in 1931 and 1932 that he was select as major in 1931.
15] In 1935, the city residents approved a charter amendment establishing the Civil Service Commission.
For the last century, Flint s history has been dominated by both the auto industry and car culture.
During the Sit-Down Strike of 1936–1937, the fledgling United Automobile Workers triumphed over General Motors, inaugurating the era of labor unions.
The successful mediation of the strike by Governor Frank Murphy , culminating in a one page agreement recognizing the Union, began an era of successful organizing by the UAW.
17] The city was a major contributor of tanks and other war machines during World War II due to its extensive manufacturing facilities.
For decades, Flint remained politically significant as a major population center as well as for its importance to the automotive industry.
A freighter named after the city, the SS City of Flint was the first US ship to be captured during the Second World War in October, 1939.
The vessel was later sunk in 1943.
The eighth deadliest tornado on record in the United States struck Beecher , just north of Flint, on June 8, 1953, killing 115 people, injuring 844.
Known as the   Beecher Tornado  , after the North Side community which the tornado devastated.
On the next day the same weather system spawned the worst tornado in New England in Worcester , Massachusetts, killing another 94 people.
The city s population peaked in 1960 at almost 200,000, at which time it was the second largest city in the state.
The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint s prosperity and influence.
They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably including the Flint Cultural Center.
19] This landmark remains one of the city s chief commercial and artistic draws to this day.
Since the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from disinvestment , deindustrialization , depopulation and urban decay , as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty.
Initially, this took the form of   white flight   that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities.
S.
In the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010.
Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint.
Many factors have been blamed, including outsourcing, exporting jobs abroad, moving jobs to non-union facilities, unionization , exorbitant overhead, globalization , and more recently, a dramatic decline in General Motors sales.
This decline was highlighted in the film Roger & Me by Michael Moore  the title refers to Roger B.
Smith , the CEO of General Motors during the 1980s .
AutoWorld   during the 1980s.
Moore, a native of Davison  a Flint suburb , revisited Flint in his later movies, including Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9 11 .

On March 5, 2002, the city s voters recalled mayor Woodrow Stanley .
A few months later, on May 8, the state of Michigan appointed an emergency financial manager ,  Ed Kurtz.
The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, Darnell Earley , in the city administrator position.
In August, city voters elected former Mayor James Rutherford to finish the remainder of Stanley s term of office.
On September 24, Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm.
The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency demolitions .
On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor  from $107,000 to $24,000  and the City Council members  from $23,000 to $18,000 .
He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials.
After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14.
Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager.
This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees.

Emergency measures continued in 2003.
In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman s office.

In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in sewer and road projects.
Don Willamson was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10.
In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit.
For the 2003–2004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.
With pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city s contribution into the system.
On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council s and the Mayor s pay and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004–05 budget.
In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.

ESBJÖRN SVENSSON:                    DIÁLOGOS EN MARTES.
T.
Tuesday                      Wonderland.
Según el batería Magnus Öström,                      autor del título del CD:  Los martes no tienen                      nada de especial  ... , pero si comienzas a apreciar las pequeñas                      cosas de la vida, podrías ver los martes con una perspectiva                      diferente.  ...  Lo que nosotros hacemos –música– podría no significar nada para mucha gente, pero si                      te sumerges en ella, podrías hacer un viaje y descubrir                      tu propio mundo, un viaje que podría cambiar tu vida .
Arturo Mora entrevistó, en exclusiva, al pianista Esbjörn                      Svensson para Tomajazz.
Cómo no, la conversación                      tuvo lugar un martes.
ARTURO MORA: ¿Qué nos puedes decir                      sobre el nuevo disco, Tuesday Wonderland?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Realmente no hay nada                      que decir aparte de escuchar la música, lo cual es,                      por supuesto, una respuesta muy aburrida, pero por eso hacemos                      música, porque no somos poetas ni nada de eso, no necesitamos                      utilizar muchas palabras.
Decimos todo lo que hay que decir                      con música.
Pero si lo escuchas seguido puedes                      oir que se trata de algo completo, que hay una línea                      común en todo el disco, como pasa en los libros.
ARTURO MORA: El CD anterior, Viaticum,                      sonaba algo oscuro comparado con los discos anteriores, pero                      en mi opinión Tuesday Wonderland suena incluso                      más oscuro, y el uso de contrabajo distorsionado suena                      muy heavy.
Estábais buscando ese tipo                      de sonido, o sucedió de forma natural?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Todo lo que se oye en                      el álbum ha salido de una forma muy natural.
Parece que lo que                      ha ocurrido probablemente tenga que ver con la música                      que compuse, y también tiene mucho que ver con el trío,                      con cómo estamos tocando, con cómo nos enfocamos                      la música que estamos intentando tocar.
ARTURO MORA: Entonces, ¿la música                      refleja vuestro estado personal como músicos?
T.
ARTURO MORA: Otra de las cosas que he observado                      es que el concepto orquestal es quizás más fuerte                      que en discos anteriores, que hay más melodía                      y más arreglos y menos espacio para la improvisación.
Fue un movimiento deliberado o también surgió de forma natural?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: No estoy seguro de estar                      de acuerdo.
Habrá muchas partes de la música                      que suenen más compuestas que improvisadas, pero también                      puede ser como dices, la verdad es que no estoy seguro de                      si hay un porcentaje mayor de material compuesto que improvisado.
Puede ser porque empecé a componer el álbum                      desde un punto de vista muy clásico.
Estaba intentando                      hacer una especie de Clave bien temperado  para el trío, que no acabó de                      funcionar.
De todas formas me di cuenta de que teníamos                      material que se podía recomponer o “rearreglar” y nos pusimos a ello.
Quizás este álbum suene                      de un modo que no se corresponde con mi idea original del Clave bien temperado.
ARTURO MORA: Cuando compones, ¿piensas                      en cómo sonarán los temas en directo, o sencillamente                      aprovechas al máximo las posibilidades del estudio,                      y tocar en directo será otro problema?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Creo que cuando compongo                      intento pensar en cómo podemos tocar las cosas, y eso                      no nos causa una gran diferencia: si funciona en el estudio                      funciona en directo, y si funciona en directo funciona en                      el estudio.
Puede parecer que utilizamos muchas pistas adicionales,                      pero lo cierto es que no es para tanto, porque muchas de las                      cosas están grabadas en una sola toma, y de hecho tocamos                      sonidos que pueden parecer regrabados, pero no lo están.
El sonido se graba tal como lo tocamos.
ARTURO MORA: Hablando de ese proceso de estudio, ¿qué importancia tiene vuestro ingeniero de                      sonido Ake Linton en el desarrollo del grupo?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Bueno, Ake Linton es                      un hombre muy, muy importante en este proceso.
Es el cuarto                      miembro del trío, ha viajado con nosotros durante los últimos cinco o seis años y ya habíamos                      grabado con él antes, pero este es el primer álbum                      que hemos hecho juntos de verdad desde hacía mucho                      tiempo, y fue un disfrute trabajar con él.
Bajamos                      a Goteborg y usamos su estudio, grabamos durante cuatro días,                      entramos en el estudio, apagamos nuestros teléfonos                      móviles, nos concentramos, trabajamos muy duro durante                      esos cuatro días y grabamos el álbum completo.
ARTURO MORA: Hay una canción en el disco, “Eighthundred Streets by Feet”, que está en métrica de 5 4.
Fue un ejercicio de composición,                      o sencillamente sacaste la melodía y ésta se                      fue desarrollando en esa métrica?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Esa composición                      realmente se originó con el riff que toca                      la mano izquierda en el piano  canta el riff .
Fue                      algo que empecé a tocar y me gustó; entonces                      desarrollé lo demás, saqué la melodía,                      el puente y todo eso.
Nunca había pensado en componer                      en 5 4 , fue algo que sencillamente ocurrió, este riff era en 5 4, así que decidí intentar seguir trabajando                      en ese contexto, y ver qué podía hacer con él.
ARTURO MORA: Hay otro tema, “Dolores in                      a Shoestand” que, para mí, tiene reminiscencias                      de Pat Metheny, al igual que otros temas anteriores como “Spam-Boo-Limbo”, “Elevation of Love” o la “Mohammed suite”,                      por ejemplo.
Todo el mundo sabe que tenéis una gran                      relación con Pat Metheny.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Sí, por supuesto.
Pat Metheny es sin duda uno de nuestros ídolos.
Los                      tres hemos crecido con su música, y escuchábamos                      un montón a la primera formación del Pat Metheny                      Group, creo que yo tenía 19 años la primera                      vez que escuché a la banda.
Fue la primera vez que                      vi un concierto de jazz de verdad con buenas luces, buen sonido,                      más parecido a un concierto de rock, y aun así con mucha improvisación, siendo jazz.
Creo que todo                      ello realmente me inspiró un montón, y a veces                      creo que lo que estamos haciendo con este trío no anda                      muy lejos de lo que ellos aún siguen haciendo.
T.
1999, cuando presentasteis el tema “Dodge the Dodo”  From Gagarin’s Point of View, ACT 1999 , que                      era estilísticamente diferente del material grabado                      hasta entonces, con ese pedal en Mi y ese sonido rockero.
Marcó ese tema el camino de lo que estaba por                      venir?
Por supuesto, cuando empezamos                      a tocar ese tema en directo es como si fuera una especie de “hit”, y la gente quiere escucharlo, pero a la                      vez yo intento componer música que sea natural, y nunca intento componer otro “Dodge the Dodo”.

ARTURO MORA: Hablemos del triunfo en EE UU,                      vuestra, digamos, asignatura pendiente.
Qué tal ha ido la reciente gira americana?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Estuvo bien, tocamos                      en junio conciertos, clubes, festivales en Filadelfia, Rochester,                      Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle –en un par de sitios                      distintos–, también subimos a Canadá,                      y creo que fue un gran éxito, lo pasamos muy bien y,                      en general, cuando, al principio, cuando empezamos a tocar                      en Estados Unidos era muy difícil hacer que la gente                      fuera a los conciertos, porque éramos totalmente desconocidos                      y a veces tocábamos para muy poca gente, pero parece                      que afortunadamente esos días ya pasaron y viene a                      vernos mucho público, más o menos allá donde toquemos, lo cuál es fantástico, ser europeos                      e ir a Estados Unidos a tocar jazz.
ARTURO MORA: Debe de ser genial.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Lo es, es fantástico.

Sé que algún periodista intentó utilizarnos                      un poco como los típicos músicos europeos, y                      a veces en contra del jazz americano.
No lo sé, realmente                      no estoy involucrado en ese debate, me encanta el jazz americano,                      y también me encanta parte del jazz europeo, y no veo                      que haya una guerra entre Estados Unidos y Europa sobre dónde                      es mejor el jazz.
ARTURO MORA: ¿Crees que se trata de un                      tema de etiquetas, más que de una diferencia real?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Sí, hoy no estamos tan aislados                      en Europa, como si nosotros estuviéramos tocando para                      los europeos y en Estados Unidos tocasen para ellos.
Cuando                      era pequeño escuchaba jazz norteamericano y, por supuesto,                      esa música me inspiró un montón.
Estoy muy agradecido a esos músicos porque escuché su música cuando era un crío, y fue por ellos                      por lo que quise tocar jazz.
El jazz europeo me es mucho más                      difícil de escuchar.
Es mucho más fácil                      escuchar músicos americanos que de otros países                      europeos, y aquí en Suecia tampoco estoy seguro de                      que fuera así.
T.
Creo que antes, cuando la gente                      montaba festivales en Europa, dependían de los músicos                      americanos, pero creo que eso ha cambiado un poco, y esos                      promotores que están montando festivales en Europa                      saben que hay música realmente interesante en Europa,                      música que de hecho atrae a un gran público.
ARTURO MORA: Aparte de esos nombres que has                      comentado, Molvaer, Wesseltoft, ¿qué otros músicos                      de jazz europeos recomendarías?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Sin duda Jorge Rossy,                      de España.
Es uno de mis baterías favoritos.
Hay otros nombres, algunos muy buenos en Londres.
Cómo                      se llama, este pianista y teclista, compositor?
Sabes, la                      gente me pregunta estas cosas, y los nombres se me dan fatal                      .
Sabes quién es este pianista compositor                      de Londres muy famoso?
Está como una cabra.
Hizo un                      arreglo muy raro de “New York, New York” para                      big band.
Bueno, quizás                      me acuerde antes de que acabemos.
Me preguntabas sobre músicos: siendo honesto no estoy tan al día, en general no escucho                      mucha música.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: La verdad es que no,                      cuando estamos de gira prefiero escuchar música clásica.
No me importaría escuchar jazz, a veces lo hago, pero                      suelo escuchar jazz antiguo, como el primer Bill Evans, o                      Herbie, u Oscar Peterson, jazz mucho más tradicional.
Por algún motivo, no sé por qué es así,                      pero en general me gusta el jazz tradicional.
No sé por qué, pero hace mucho tiempo que no oigo nada que                      realmente me impacte y que se suponga que es más que                      jazz .
Qué ocurriría si alguno de los tres                      miembros actuales no estuviera disponible?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Siempre contamos con                      hacerlo todo los tres miembros, e incluyendo también                      a Ake, los cuatro.
Pero digamos que algo pasa con poca antelación,                      que alguien cae enfermo, o no puede estar.
Creo que tocaríamos                      en dúo.
Si, digamos, tuviéramos un concierto                      y Dan no pudiera hacerlo, entonces creo que Magnus y yo probablemente tocaríamos en dúo, si Magnus no pudiera entonces                      Dan y yo tocaríamos en dúo, no creo que incorporásemos                      a un sustituto.
T.
De hecho nos pasó hace un par de años.
ARTURO MORA: Como músico, ¿qué estás estudiando ahora mismo?
Keith Jarrett,                      llevo un tiempo con él, porque ya había escuchado                      mucho a Keith, pero estoy oyendo su nuevo disco, Live                      at Carnegie Hall, en el que toca algunos temas antiguos,                      y es muy bonito escuchar lo que hace.
ARTURO MORA: Estoy de acuerdo.
Hay alguna                      posibilidad de que vengáis pronto a tocar a España?
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Me encantaría,                      siempre es un placer tocar en España, pero por lo que                      sé, no pasará nada quizás hasta la primavera,                      no creo que podamos hacer algo antes.
Nunca digas “de                      este agua no beberé”, pero el calendario está muy apretado ahora mismo, con muchos conciertos en Alemania,                      Francia y Suiza, y ya hemos tocado en Suecia.
Pero ya veremos,                      me encantaría bajar, tocar en España siempre                      es un placer.
ARTURO MORA: Espero que vengáis pronto.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Realmente es difícil                      saberlo.
Intento ir día a día, y ahora estamos                      intentando tocar todos los conciertos que podamos para presentar                      el nuevo álbum, con la nueva música, intentando                      desarrollar esa música en vivo sobre el escenario.
Como decía, vamos a tocar en Francia en octubre, tocaremos                      mucho en Alemania, Londres, Suiza en noviembre, tenemos algunos                      conciertos en Italia, y después Asia en enero, y luego                      primavera y verano, y ése es más o menos el                      plan futuro.
Luego, por supuesto, ya estoy empezando a pensar                      un poco en qué dirección podríamos tomar,                      qué deberíamos hacer, pero eso no es algo de                      lo que quiera hablar ahora, porque tengo tantas ideas diferentes                      en mi cabeza ahora mismo .
Prefiero ordenarlas antes                      de empezar a hablar sobre ello.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: ¡Espera un segundo!
Debo de tener un disco por aquí.

Emerging zoonotic diseases: new threats for old?

September 12, 2014; Philadelphia, PA] – From a major Ebola outbreak in West Africa to MERS in Saudi Arabia to polio in Syria to chikungunya in the Caribbean, the news these days is full of stories about viruses.
The Microbial Communities in Health and Disease symposium, sponsored by Penn Vet, in collaboration with the University  of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and School of Arts & Sciences, will explore how bacteria, parasites, viruses, and other organisms interact with their animal and human hosts in ways that either maintain health or lead to disease.
Philadelphia .
Presentations for the scientific community will take place at Penn Vet’s Hill Pavilion  380 S.
Philadelphia  on Thursday, October 16, 2014.

One of the most frightening things about viruses is how they emerge without warning, vanish mysteriously, and then return again even more dangerous than before.
Zimmer will discuss how scientists are uncovering the hidden rules by which new viruses evolve and spread.
To do so, they’re exploring the networks of connections that join human societies together and also link our species to other animals with which we share the planet—and with which we can share diseases.
On October 16, eight prominent scientists will discuss cutting-edge work investigating how microbes not only cause disease, but also how “good bugs” promote health.
Martin F.
This event is made possible in part by the Provost Interdisciplinary Seminar Fund Award and exemplifies the One Health Initiative, which is dedicated to improving the lives of all species through the integration of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and environmental science.
The symposium is spearheaded by Penn Vet’s Center for Host-Microbial Interactions.
The Center funded five pilot projects last year to explore the intersection of microbes and disease in order to benefit both animal and human health.
The second round of funded projects will be announced next month.
Penn Vet is a global leader in veterinary medicine education, research, and clinical care.
Founded in 1884, Penn Vet is the only veterinary school developed in association with a medical school.
The school is a proud member of the One Health Initiative, linking human, animal, and environmental health.
Penn Vet serves a diverse population of animals at its two campuses, which include extensive diagnostic and research laboratories.
Ryan Hospital in Philadelphia provides care for dogs, cats, and other domestic companion animals, handling more than 31,000 patient visits a year.
New Bolton Center, Penn Vet’s large-animal hospital on nearly 700 acres in rural Kennett  Square, PA, cares for horses and livestock farm animals.
The hospital handles more than 4,000 patient visits a year, while the Field Service treats nearly 36,000 patients at local farms.

After 84-year-old Occupy Seattle participant Dorli Rainey was pepper sprayed by Seattle Police yesterday, she wrote:  This is what democracy looks like.
It certainly left an impression on the people who rode the No.
1 bus home with me.
When officials from 40 cities across America participated in conference calls on tackling the Occupy protests, they said their goal was to make the camps safe.
On a National Police Radio news bulletin yesterday afternoon, New York correspondent Robert Smith, reporting on the ongoing legal fight to reconstruct the camp at Ziccotti Park, said of the dispute: one person’s trash is another person’s free speech — overlooking the fact that what he referred to as “trash” were the personal belongings of others.
Likewise, when NPR reports on the destruction of camps, they happily parrot the police by using the term “dismantle” — as though officers take pains to find matching bags into which they can slip neatly folded sleeping bags, all the while making sure every item gets carefully tagged so later it can safely be returned to its owner.
In truth the camps have been dismantled in much the same way that Israeli soldiers “dismantle” Bedouin villages that the authorities deem illegal.
In many ways, the real clash is between those who cling to the anti-democratic powers that the state grabbed after 9 11, and those who dare to declare that we should no longer be governed by fear.
Tellingly, the authorities in New York planned the assault on Occupy Wall Street like a counterterrorism operation.
From the beginning, I have said that the city had two principal goals: guaranteeing public health and safety, and guaranteeing the protesters’ first amendment rights.
But when those two goals clash, the health and safety of the public and our first responders must be the priority,” Mayor Bloomberg said , asserting that “safety” is more important than liberty.
T]he police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared by watching how occupations in other cities played out.
A major disaster drill was held on Randalls Island, with an eye toward Zuccotti.
Officials increased so-called disorder training — counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The few cops that I know that were called into this thing, they were not told it was for going into Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Once the operation began, the area around the park was declared a “frozen zone”.
What gets frozen in a frozen zone?
S.
Constitution — no more freedom of assembly, free speech, or free press .
As concerns over safety and sanitation grew at the encampments over the last month, officials from nearly 40 cities turned to each other on conference calls, sharing what worked and what hasn’t as they grappled with the leaderless movement.
In one case, the calls became group therapy sessions.
Oakland, Calif.
New York City over the last several days may suggest a coordinated effort, authorities and a group that organized the calls say they were a coincidence.
It was completely spontaneous,” said Chuck Wexler, director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national police group that organized calls on Oct.
11 and Nov.

Among the issues discussed: safety, traffic and the fierceness of demonstrations in each city.
This was an attempt to get insight on what other departments were doing,” he said.
Has the United States really become a country where we are supposed to be afraid of freedom and nervous about democracy?
It was completely spontaneous,” said Chuck Wexler, director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national police group that organized calls on Oct.

LIES.
I facetiously used the self-contradictory phrase, “spontaneously coordinated assault”.
I would add that even if the respective mayors did not conspire and coordinate their assault plans, they each had clear self-interest in wanting to acting at the same time: use of excessive force in multiple cities at the same time, diminishes the risk that any one of those cities would then get most of the media attention.
Once the random brutality of the police becomes sufficiently commonplace, the mainstream media quickly concludes it’s no longer newsworthy.
Just more cases of policemen beating up women in what is rapidly becoming America’s new normal.
JE: “A military style raid on peaceful protesters camped out in the shadow of Wall Street, ordered by a cold ruthless billionaire who bought his way into the mayor’s office.

Photo of the Hill City baseball team my grandfather played on.
My grandfather, Clarence Arthur       Thompson, is the 3rd person from the right.
I have come across a old photograph of a great aunt who was born in Canada.
She moved to ND in 1877 and later married a gentleman from either ND or Minn.
The photograph was taken by a photographer named REED and the back       of the picture says Bimidgi, Minn.
I have no idea how old the picture is       and I was wondering if you had any info on the photographer, example how       long he was in Bemidgi etc.

Myre s Camp, 3 miles East       of Blackduck.
20, 580 Feet.
The photographer is Harry F.
Nixon.
I think this may have been taken near       Black Duck, Beltrami County, MN.
I believe this is a picture of a logging       camp.
I am trying to learn how to locate records, so I can learn more about       which relative worked here.
Any Ideas?
Please email me with any suggestions.
I think this is a fascinating picture.
Thanks Much.
I have a boxful of wonderful, but unidentified, photos of people who       had roots in Lake Hanska, Brown County, MN.

If you think you can identify any of these folks,       please let me know by clicking on the email button on the page.

I am not sure where this was taken or who the people are.
I am thinking       it is from around Wells, MN before 1966.
My grandfather Theodore J.
Moe was living       there at the time of his death in 1966.
We have no idea who the women and little girl are.
If you have an idea of who these people are please let us know.
I have a photo that was taken in a Nunda Township  by Emmons MN        country school.
My grandfather is one of the kids, but I don t know anyone       else in the photo.
My grandfather is about 6 years old, so it puts the photo       to date around 1915 or so.
If there is anyone whose ancestors went to school       in a country school in Nunda Township, Please contact me and we can see if       any of the kids in the photo are related to you.
I am willing to make copies       to share with you.
Thanks.
The Osterreicher Gailthal Club: Gegrundet am 25th Marz 1905,       Minneapolis MN.
Photo is at my web site .
It includes       a list of names of the people in the pictures.
My grandfather, Bror Hugo Larson, is seated on the far right and I understand       he attended a baking school in       Minnesota.
He talked about living in Little Sweden.
The only marking       on the photo is in the lower right corner,  Johnston & Co.  and  MPLS        which I have thought may be an abbreviation for Minneapolis.
The man seated       on the far left has a badge sticking out of his pocket that says  baker s       union  and two of the men in the front row are wearing what appear to be       Eagle s Lodge badges, as they look similar to the one my grandfather had.
I do not know the significance of the  canes  they are holding.
I would estimate       this photo was taken about 1906-1912.
If anyone knows about this baking school,       I could use help in identifying it.
I have several photos that were taken in Minneapolis, St.
Peter, and unknown       Minnesota location that were in my father s belongings after he died.
I have       sent copies to everyone living that I know and no one can currently identify       them.
I would love to post them on the Minnesota GenWeb site for mystery       pictures and see if anyone can identify them.
I would be willing to give       other folks digital copies.
The information provided below and above are all I know.
Thank you for your       consideration.
The following surnames are common in my family and these individuals may       be in one of these lines: Anderson, Johnson, Linstrom.

Can anyone identify the priest seated here at what appears to be a wedding.
I believe it was taken around       Crookston in the late 1800 s or early 1900 s.
There is nothing written on       the photo back.
My       oldest Aunt, Mary Dufualt, was born in 1893, so if this was taken at their       wedding then this picture could be dated shortly before that.
However this       may be wishfull thinking.
These photographs were taken about 1902 on the steps of the Euclid School       in Polk County Minnesota.
It was school district #47.
Any help in identifying       these subjects would be wonderful.
Three of them may be my ancestors but       since I wasn t around at that time I don t recognize them.
One of the adults       may be Katharine Burns  a teacher .
Three of the students may be JOHNSON s.

I am looking for photos of  Burslie Eat Shop  in Fertile, MN.
My father,       Arthur Burslie owned this restaurant in the late 1930 s and early 40 s.

On back of photo the woman on the right is named Matilda Jensen, Man in middle       is Andrias, woman on the left maybe: Lena  Caroline  Loeng Svenson, Olsen,       or she could also be Milla Mathea Bottolfson of Allamakee Co.
Iowa.
The       second photo of the man standing by the chair is the same man as in the       other photo.
On back it says this may be Andrias Jensen.
It was also taken       in Crookston Minnesota by the same photographer.
I m searching for the names of the children in these photos.
One is from       the 2nd grade class in 1933 of       Lauderdale grade school.
The other is the same group of 8th grade kids in 1945.
Hello, I here is a photo of my great       great uncle in front of his restaurant.
His name is Gary Lee Parker,       born May 21, 1884 in either Macon, GA area or Navarro County, TX.
He moved       out to St.
Paul, MN after he grew up.
I don t know if he married, if so,       who he married, or any other info.
The back of the photo noted his name,       and the location, St.
Paul, MN probably the early 1930 s?
I haven t been able to find anything else on him so I don t know how long       he stayed in St.
Paul or if he ever left at all!
Please contact me if you might be able to shed some light on this man.
His       brother, James Solomon Parker, was my great grandfather.
Gary Lee Parker s       parents were John F.
Parker and Sarah Jane Ruffin.

Family oral history is that       he was at one time a deputy sheriff in Duluth.

Does anyone know if a history of the Duluth sheriffs is kept anywhere?
Can anyone help me to identify this persons ?

Thank you for       your help and consideration.
Would like to identify this older gentleman whose photograph was with       a group of photos that I purchased on eBay.
Most of the other people in this       group of photographs were from Flandreau, Vermillion and Elk Point, South       Dakota.
The only marking on the photo is       the photographer s name;   Bauer, Winona,       Minn .  Such a great looking picture should be with this fellow s family.
I have three photos that were in with my grandmother s things.
She is       not able to identify them.
Don t know if they are attached in some way to       our family.
Perhaps someone can ID them?
The first is of a man inside St James Luthern Church in Howard Lake MN.
The second is of Benjamin Bean which is written on       the back.
The third is of an unknown       couple taken at Anderson Studios in Redwood Falls MN.
My family s surnames       from MN are BUNKER, ROLLINS, and BISHOP.
My husband s grandmother lived in Fillmore Co.

I have a copy print of my grandmother, Helen Maud Stone and three       other ladies, dressed in their hats and finery.
I do not have the 3 others       names but can only speculate they may have attended the Normal school       at Winona, MN.
1905.
This picture       appeals to me due to it showing the fashions of the day but someone may know       these other ladies and want a copy or include it in some sort of display.
She was the daughter of Azro Ashley and Sarah Francis Stone.
Azro was active       in civic and church affairs of Niccollet , holding various offices, including       Mayor of St.
Peter for one year  their home being a brownstone on Main Street       across from the Nicolett County Courthouse .
St.

Or are these 2 the same?
Included in some history she has       written are included these names, who possibly may be her friends in the       photo---- Mable Hanscom who died of Typhoid Fever in her Sr.
Rosalie Burns.
If you are interested, I can mail you a copy I ve had made--       it is perhaps a 3x5 -- at any rate , not a large photo.
I have this old photo taken probably in the 1890 s in Moorehead,       Minnesota.
The front of the photo has printing indicating the photo shop       was Flaten in that community.
The back of the photo has   Ma s uncle & wife  and on the front of the photo someone has placed x s over the supposed       relatives.
I think that all of these folks are related to me, why would they       all be posed for a formal photograph if not related?
Any comments would be       appreciated.
The home of these folks is somewhere in northwestern Mn,       around Otter Tail county.
I believe the surnames to be first, Augunsons & possibily Torgrimsons.
I have in my possession a family photo taken at A.
E.
Woolett Photographers address was 110 Washington Avenue South, Minneapolis.
The picture is       of an elderly female family member to one of my Great Great Grandfathers       family  Louis Barrette  who resided in the area during the 1800 s,       I know it s a long shot but somtimes glass negatives from old photographers       are preserved at area historical societies and I was wondering if anyone       had knowledge of this photographer.
I am trying to identify the person in       the picture.
Any help would be appreciated.
This picture of an unknown woman was taken by H.
Boetcher, 225 E.
7th Street, St.
Paul, Minnesota.
It was       probably taken during the 1890 s or early 1900 s.
It was found, along with       some other unknown pictures, among pictures having belonged to my great       grandmother, Louise Anna GONION HOUSE.
She lived in Willow City & Towner,       North Dakota and also several different places in Montana.
Known related       family names are: HOUSE, GONION, GAGNON, WILLITS, LYMBURNER, KENNEY, YATES,       NELSON, TURCOTTE, BEMIS, BEAUCHAMP.
Photos found in a very old       pillow in the attic of STULL house in Staples, MN.

I have a large number of PAULSON family photos.

Some of the first names are Bertha, Ella, John,       Simon, Sam, Henry, Peter.
Bertha was my grandfather s  Rudolph BETLACH  second       wife.
I believe Bertha and Rudolph met in the Granite Falls, Minnesota area.
I need help identifying some of the photos.
Bertha was married once before       to a Carl Farnum and I think they may have lived in Aberdeen, SD.
You can       contact: Patty Betlach       Russell .

The Gotts seem to have lived in Maine, the Brookfields       in San Diego.
I have a ton of newspaper clippings, cards, letters and photographs       that partain to this family.
The last known person in this family died in       1969 at the age of 100 years.
I would love to find a living relative for       this stuff!

My pictures of unknown persons ,  St.

George Holmes Crary  dentist , son of John Wesley Crary  1808-1902        and Mindwell Permelia Holmes  1810-1877  born 24 Sept 1838, Potsdam, St.
Lawrence, NY married Catharine Phoebe Cooper, daughter of Ezra Cooper  1810       - 1885  and Maria Fanny Johnson  1818-1901  born 27 Jan 1840, Champlain,       Clinton, NY.
The two young girls are in a tent       that is marked COOPER.
Or Possibly pictures of Bryant family or Fairbanks family or Lounsberry family.
I have a large group photo of which my great grandparents are in.
There are       no markings on the pictures and I am unable to identify others in the photo.
It could be a family picture as it appears to me many resemble another.
My       ggrandparents names are Henry Kirchoff       and Agnes Buetow .
They resided in St.
Paul since l900 s but had relatives       in Belle Plaine.
Henry died in 1948 so the photo was obviously before then       but perhaps not too much.
If anyone can help identify others in the photo       I would greatly appreciate it!
I am looking for photos of  Burslie Eat Shop  in Fertile, MN.

Thank you for your time.
I have inherited 3 photographs of I assume members of my family.
I have no       idea who they are.
I know that members of the HOOK family who went       to the border areas of Illinois and Wisconsin  GraysLake and Waukegan .
These       may be from the COUSINS or CLARGO family I don t know.
Any way one       was taken by D B NYE 811 Nicollet Ave, Minneapolis, another says MILLER 415,       417 & 419 Nicollet Ave, Minneapolis{branches Ashland,Wis & St Cloud,       Minn.
The 3rd says BISHOPS STUDIO, Minneapolis.
Is there any one out there       who could tell me when any of these company s were in business to help me       date the photo s.
Would it be worth getting copies made and sent to a local       Minneapolis newspaper to see if they would print them in case any body could       identify any of the subjects.
I believe they date from between 1880 and 1920.
Photo 1 , Photo 2 , Photo 3 .
Any help from your listers       would be much appreciated.
I have found more information on my 2nd great uncle, who owned CVR Clark       Photography Studio s.
He was at 602 1 2 Central Avenue in Minneapolis,       Minnesota.
Then in Montrose, Minnesota, Delano, Minnesota, and then to Lake       Benton, Minnesota.
He was in Delano from July 1889 to December of 1889, then       on to Lake Benton.
If any one has Photos with CVR Clark Photography Studio s       and could date them and where they were taken, I would really like to hear       from you as I m trying to find out where Charles Van Rensalaer Clark,       ended up as I believe my 2nd great grand mother, his mother Catharine Janet       Gillett Clark, ended up with him, as she lived to 1923, 15 years longer then       my 2nd great grand father.
Thanks.

On the back       of the photo is written, Adelaid Smith        Addie  , born in Minneapolis.

Would be glad to       share any of these photographs.
I have recently been scanning some old family pictures that belonged       to my grandmother and or her sister, and have run into a small snag identifying       5 of them.
To set the stage, my grandmother was Grace Druey, daughter       of John Druey who lived for a few years prior to 1878 in Chatfield.
John       had a brother Frank that lived in Chatfield most of his adult life and is       buried there.
Some of his children stayed in the area and maybe some stayed       in the Winona area.
I have recently found out that my grandfather, Melvin       Perry Davis, had an uncle Edwin Sumner Davis that spent most of       his adult life in Winona and is buried there.
The five photos presented here       probably came from my grandmother s sister Lilly, who occasionally visited       the Rochester area.
According to my mother, these pictures are from friends       of Lilly s and had no connection to the family that she knew of.
I seriously       believe however, that these photos could be of some Druey or Davis boys and       would love to make contact if any of the descendants of Frank Druey or Edwin       Davis are still around the Chatfield or Winona areas.
If anyone could help       identify these lads I would be very grateful.
Photo 1 , which is in a brown tri-fold       folder, has no markings whatsoever, and would appear to be a  wannabe  World       War I soldier.
Photo 2 is in a brown tri-fold folder       and is a great picture of a young US Reserve Infantry Officer.
As can be       seen on his sleeve,  Givens Photo San Francisco .
No other identification.
Photo 3 is a small wallet size photo       of a young soldier that looks to be wearing the leather leggings of a cavalry       man.
The steep hill and the trolley track in the background suggest to me       that this picture also could have been taken in San Francisco.
The only other       identification is  X 22  on the back, which leads me to believe he may have       ordered 22 more copies to give out to his friends and relatives?
Photo 4 is of three apparent Military       Police soldiers, one a Sergeant.
Two at least, are sporting some kind of        US  patch on their lower left sleeve, but I can t make out what it says.
On the back of this photo is  This is a GUARANTEED Print by VAN VRANKEN S       STUDIO WINONA, MINN. Mail Orders Solicited  I believe that these were the       people that made this print, but where the photo was actually taken is subject       to question.
Photo 5 is a fading picture of a       soldier from the Signal Corps.
I m thinking this picture was from the same       time frame, but from an entirely different locality.
This is a postcard,       and is stamped on the back,  Viden 319 So. El Paso St. .
Was this from El       Paso, TX?
The campaign hat is somewhat reminiscent of the Spanish American       War, or maybe this trooper was with Pershing chasing Poncho Villa.

I have a photo of a very handsome young man  late teens or early 20 s  in       a military uniform.
It is in a folder that has a shield on the front with       these words: Qualitas Servitum.

It is not a uniform of St.

Any suggestions as to what Military school       this might be?

Does anyone know when these studios where operating?
Does anyone have information       about these families?

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi, I have a porcelain dinnerplate with a wedding picture embossed into this       plate.
It is dated year 1888 and has a wedding photo of Uni and Henry       Hanson on it.
Our family has a copy of the wedding photo of Antje Maria Caroline PRIEN.
Unfortunately, this is only a copy of one of the originals,       which the photographer supplied for the happy couple to give to friends and       family.
One of these originals most likely would have included the name of       the photographer and his location.
The information recorded on the back of       or copy states,  sister of great-grandmother HARGENS  PERRINE  .
While       researching the parish registers of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany for       the PRIEN family, we discovered the bride s name and that she was born on       11 Nov 1855.
Her parents were Johann Nicolaus Heinrich PRIEN and his       wife, Catharina Margaretha FICK.
A marriage for Antje Maria Caroline PRIEN       was not registered in Heide, but she may have married in Hamburg, where she       worked as a maid during the late 1870 s and 1880 s.
It is also possible that       she came to America and was married here.
Our ELLGEN relatives, who live       in Murray and Pipestone counties may be able to help us find out the name       of the groom and where they were married.
We would love to solve this mystery.
Thank you.

It is a large piece that has       pictures of both of them in little inserts.

I have other photo s of many of the individuals in this picture, so if there s       anyone out there that thinks it might be one of their people I can scan other       individual photo s of these same people.
The       photo was taken in Crookston, Minnesota but may be a family of       Euclid or surrounding area.
It was taken at Shrin Seth  unsure because       the writing is pretty fancy .

I have a family picture of mine       that I was hoping that other members of the KNICKERBACKER family in       Minnesota maybe able to help.
The picture had to have been taken before 1894,       because GG-Grandpa Herman Knickerbacker died in May of 1894.
They were from       the St.
Cloud, MN area since 1869.
1895 and Herman       supposedly died in 1894.
I do not know of any Samuel Knickerbacker during this time period.
Am hoping to find any living Knickerbackers that would be able to help me       correctly identify everyone.
Thanks.
I have an envelope full of small portraits that seem to be all of the same       family.
On the back of only one of these is the location given, and that       seems to be Pipestone, Minn.
The pictures are only about an inch in       diameter, and are of the McTurk, Soll, Remsen, and Kock families.
The names are as follows, Farlam F ; Tom and Addie McTurk; Uncle Henry & Louise; mother Anna Soll & Meta Kock Remsen; Tom McTurk & Louise;       Louise 14 yrs; Pete & Meta Kock; grandpa Clausen & Andrew Soll & Pete Kock; and Linda.
I would like to find the proper home for these and       would ask only a small reimbursement to cover my expenses.
I enthusiastically       endorse Gen Web and your attempt at returning such things as photos and       memorabilia to their families.
Thanks.
1940s, showing my grandfather and five other men.
It s a high       probablity that they are in the 47th Infantry Divsion at Fort Rucker, AL.
There are no markings on the back and no names to go with the other men.
Does anyone recognize these men?
1920s or early 1930s.
Again there are no names       or markings on the back, so I can t name the girls in the center or right.
If anyone knows who the two are, I would appreciate knowing.
I don t know who these men are but I am guessing they lived       in the east side of St.
Paul in the 1938 or went to Cretin HS.
Both are taken       in 1938.
I came across a photo in a Portland, Oregon antique shop that might interest       someone.
The best I can make out from the inscription on the back is that       it is Mr.
Les.
W.
Lanbier and family and that it was taken in Alexandria, Minn.
The attached photograph is of Margaret and Roberta Langdon, taken in April 1919.
Margaret was 6       years old and Roberta 1 1 2.
This picture was one of many that had belonged       to a relative in my husband s family, Thoris Roach, and given to me after       her death.
The Roach family lived at 3324 1st Ave South in Minneapolis from       1901 to the 1970 s when Thoris Roach was moved to a nursing home.
She was       the daughter of Fred & Ida Roach, born in 1901 and lived at 3324 1st       Ave S.
It appears that the Langdon family were neighbors       and friends of the Roach family.
I would be happy to give the original photograph       to a relative of the Langdon family, and I may have other photos the Langdon       children appreared in.
My grandfather, Bror Hugo Larson, is seated on the far right and I understand       he attended a baking school in       Minnesota.
He talked about living in Little Sweden.
The only marking       on the photo is in the lower right corner,  Johnston & Co.  and  MPLS        which I have thought may be an abbreviation for Minneapolis.
The man seated       on the far left has a badge sticking out of his pocket that says  baker s       union  and two of the men in the front row are wearing what appear to be       Eagle s Lodge badges, as they look similar to the one my grandfather had.
I do not know the significance of the  canes  they are holding.
I would estimate       this photo was taken about 1906-1912.
If anyone knows about this baking school,       I could use help in identifying it.
This picture was send to my grandmother in Menahga, MN from a Mrs.
Dec.
17, 1916.
There is no post mark or stamp.
Is       as follows: Dec.
Thanks for the postal received       some time ago.
Wishing you       a Merry Xmas.

I have lots of photos on the Loudon family of Mpls MN 1880-1930 s and newspaper       clippings etc.
I also have an old photo album they brought over from Scotland.
They were not in MN.
I have a scrapbook like it on the Loudons too.
SELKE FAMILY.
I have a whole box of family photos mainly of the Alfred       Paul Selke family of Sauk Rapids.
Alfred was my uncle by marriage to Bertha       Madison of St.
Paul.
MN.
Gottlieb, born in the town of Osiek, Kreise Wirsitz, Prov.
Louise Bertha 1880-1962.
Married Emil Reynold Pochardt.
Gottlieb and Hanna are my paternal great grandparents.
All their children       were born in Alta Vista Twp.
Louise are buried in the Alta       Vista Cemetery in Alta Vista Twp.
The second picture was taken before 1906.
It is of Gottlieb, Hanna Manke and       Julius August Manke 1852-1906 and his 2nd wife Augusta Carolina Henrietta       Liedke Voll 1851-1935.
The picture indicates it was taken in Wheaton, MN.
Why, I don t know.
Maybe it was a funeral?
I do have the Manke family histories.
This is a pic of Charles Marks        taken in Clara City, MN.
Owners of the studio, were E.
Waters & A.
Levy.
Rumor in the Marks family for years was that Charles was the illegitmate       son of Karl Marx, the communist, but from all the searching I have done this       is untrue.
CROOKSTON- If anyone has any photos of the Crookston Tanning Company       or the Miller Tanning Company please let me know.

COM  Please put in a subject or I will not open!
At a giant flea market called Goldrush in Oronoco, MN in late August, 1999       I came across the following item.
August MILLER and Mary SWENSEN  married May 7, 1890 in       Minneapolis, MN, witnesses John and Margaret Calder, Pastor SW Boft.
This was the kind of beautiful piece in fabulous shape that should be reunited       with it s family members!
I did not buy it  It cost $80  but I did write       down who had it for sale.
If anyone knows descendants of this family the two photos  one of bride and       one of groom  with the certificate would be priceless to them.
Please feel free to pass this along to whatever list you feel can help.
I rescued an old photo album from a thrift store, trying to find family of Nissens.
Names include Anna Myatt Nissen, Phylis Nissen, Mildred Nissen,       Joann, David.
One picture is at a Lake Delavon, Wis.
Most pictures are of       the 1920 s.
Would love to find next of kin.
Some pictures are made at a studio       in Dickson, Tenn.
Please email me if you are part of this family group.
The man in the photo is Merit and his photo was taken on Sept 22, 1890 in       MN.
I scanned the front and back of the three photos.
I hope they will be of value to researchers.
Merit lived from 1841 to 1896.

1900  of Mr.
Mrs.
Peter Grant Reynard of Merriam       Park, near Minneapolis.
Any relatives or archival library may contact       me.
This photo was taken around 1925 .
I       know the identity of three of the individuals: Center, Nelson Rice,       Civil War veteran; right of him, Jacob Arthur Werner, went on to be       mayor of St.
Louis Park in the 1940s and 1950s; left rear, Willard       Werner, Jacob s son and my grandfather.
Nelson was Willard s grandfather,       and Jacob s father-in-law.
I d like to know more about the other people in       the photo, as well as a better date for it.
Willard was born in 1910, and       looks to be about 15 in the picture, hence the extimate of 1925.
The small       mark in the lower left corner is a photographer in Minneapolis.
I have several pictures and some hand written family history, on a Rutledge       Family as he was my stepfather, We knew very little about him.
He was       born in MN, around 1902 or 03.
I would be more than happy to send this to       anyone, that might like to have it.
Schreffler was the name on the photos.
If you have any information can you please contact me.

Does anyone have any information about her brothers and       sisters as to where they lived and died or any of their decendents?
Any       information would be appreciated.
Thank-you, Joy F.
We have an old old photo album with very small pictures in it.
Some of them       are tintypes.
We believe the album belonged to Torger Swenson  sometimes       referred to as Targei Svensson  who came from Aseral, Vest Agder County,       Norway, Tjaldal Farm to Crow Lake Township, Stearns County, MN.
He       was a member of the Crow River Lutheran Church in Kandiyohi County, MN.
He       was brother to my husband s great grandfather, Anon Swenson of Pope       County, Lake Johanna Township, MN.
Only one of Torger s children married       and she didn t have any children so the album was passed on to our family       and we fell heir to it several years ago.
There are over 50 pictures in it       and only 1 of them is identified.
Some of the pictures have photographer s       names on them.
Two of the pictures were taken in Willmar, MN, by John       Ericks, photographer.
I went to Willmar s Historical Society earlier this       week and the curator there said that he had to have been a photographer there       before 1900 because they have researched all the photographers in Willmar       back to around 1900 and John Ericks is not one of them.
Torger s wife was       Mari  Mary  Tollefsdatter, born 1849 in Bygland, Setersdal, Norway and she       died in 1931 in Stearns County, MN.
Her parents were Torstein Tollefson and       Matilda or Birgit Torsteinsdatter.
It is possible that some of the pictures       could be of her family, but we definitely know that at least 2 of the pictures       in the album are of brother s of Torger who stayed in Norway.
We would be       glad to send photocopies of all of the unidentified pictures to anyone who       would possibly have any knowledge about this family or who would be interested       in this project.
Many of the pictures are from shortly after the Civil War,       we think, and some of them are from CT, NY, IL.
Many have been taken in       Minneapolis.
One has been taken in Crookston.
Torger s children were: Alice        Mary Alice  Swenson, Betsy Swenson, Sven Swenson, Anne Swenson, Jorgine       Swenson and Thea Swenson who married Frank Johnson and was a furrier in Duluth,       MN.
We have only identified 3 of the pictures and so we have a long ways       to go!

Hawkinson       of Mazeppa, MN at an unknown date.
Although the picture quality is       not what I had hoped for, perhaps someone out there has a clue as to their       name or any other hints as to what I could do next to discover my relative s        identity .
What was her married name?
Where did she and her husband live,       and where did they die?
Thank you for any help you may be able to       provide.
I am searching for my         Warner    family branch       and the search has taken me to Minnesota.
I have attached two antique photographs       that were apparently taken in the  G. Collier Studio 2005 S. Superior Street       West, Duluth, Minnesota.  The name  G Collier  was printed on the photocard       in gold ink.
It is written in script that somewhat resembles this  G. Collier.        The thin sides of the photo are also covered with gold ink or other type       of shiny material.
The photo itself seems to have been glued to the card.
I do not have a specific name for the people depicted in the photos, but       by deduction they are probably Warner s.
The children in the one photo and       the young man in the other, bear a striking resemblance to the Warner Photos       posted by Cheryl L.
Parsons of Clay New York.
Photos: Late 1800-Early 1900 s unidentified old cardboards from MINNEAPOLIS,       MN I gained access to about 35 professional photos taken in Minneapolis MN       from various studios.

The daughter found these in a bundle in her moms attic.
Some       are from the WESTMARK family.
Some maybe from other families.

Can anyone identify this photo?
It is likely members of the Jesse or John J.
Youngs family .
Appears to be taken very early and would date from the mid to late 1800 s       and looks like a 4 generation picture.
It was sent to me by a Youngs family       member, with no identifying marks on it.
Jesse Youngs b: 1790 in Conn.
Mn.
He was the       father to the following children; John J, Joseph, Phidella, Anna, Robert,       Enoch, and Mathilda Youngs.
John J.
Youngs was married to Almeda E.
Lovell and both died in Wabasha county       Mn.
They were the parents of the following children; Benjamin Franklin Youngs,       Henrietta Amanda Youngs, Phoebe A Youngs, George Riley Youngs, Jesse E.
Youngs,       and Joseph Henry Youngs.
These children married as follows and lived in Wabasha county, Mn.
1900 s.
Benjamin Franklin to Annis Bump; Henrietta to Henry  Howdy  Sibley; Phoebe       to James Harrison; George Riley to Naomi Ann Sibley   Henry  Howdy  and Naomi       were brother & sister ; Jesse to Bernice Owens; and Joseph Henry to Elizabeth       Hook.
I believe the picture is of Jesse Youngs  the elder , John J.
Any help in identifying the picture is greatly       appreciated.
Can anyone help identify this photo ?
It came from a descendant       of George Riley YOUNGS and Naomi Ann SIBLEY.
Youngs and Almeda E.

Naomi was the daughter of Phebe Ann Covey and Joseph Charles Sibley, Sr.
The John J.

Attached is the photo of an unidentified young man.
It was taken       at the Charles Zimmermann studio, St.
Paul, MN probably ca.
1885, printed       on hardboard.
Possibly a copy of an earlier picture.
It came to me from a       source in Florida who bought it in a junk shop.
00 + the subject s       name, postpaid.
I have a large photo of unknown origin with lots of people on it.
No markings on it at all.
We are looking for photos taken by Simon Bangen who photographed the settlement       of the Bella Coola colony in British Columbia Canada in 1894.
He arrived       in 1895 and returned with his family to the Crookston area in 1897.
Simon       was an exceptional good photographer who documented the settlers at work,       at leisure and their finished homes and families.
80 plate negatives while here.
We have many of his in our collection but every once in awhile one will surface       that was sent to relations of the Colonists in Minnesota from Bella Coola.
Crookston area or that he kept       copies of his originals.
Norway from relations.
Any information would be appreciated as to his photos or information on Simon       or his descendants.
Our Web page and Archival data base is in the works.
Picture 1 - Photographer Skrin Seth       Crookston Minn.
Back row fourth from left is in all of the photo s.
I m thinking that picture 2 was taken on the same day as the outfit is the       same.
This is probably her parents & siblings?
Picture 2 - is of the same subject       as #1-4 although taken at different times.
Photo taken at Skrin Seth Crookston       Minn.
On the back of this picture is written: Miss Clara Johnson, Box 98       Euclid Minn.
I don t think these are photo s of Clara.
I have compared these       photo s to some I have of Clara.
Clara Johnson moved to Ontario in 1905 so       these pics were taken before that as far as I know.
Picture 3 - is again the same woman.
Note that the little       one is wearing the woman s brooch now.
Photographer is Skrin Seth Crookston       and Bagley Minn.
Picture 4 - is again of the pretty       lady, but this time she is pictured with who I assume is her husband and       children.
This is a picture postcard so there is no location or photographer.
Any help in identifying who this woman is would be so great.
I would love       to get them back to the rightful family if they are not related to me, if       they are, I would gladly make copies for anyone who can also claim relationship.
Photo1 was taken at Skrin Seth in       Crookston Minn.
This lady seems to have a photo of a man in her brooch.
I       wonder if it is what they call funeral jewelry?
Perhaps the fellow in the       second photo?
This woman may have resided in Crookston or Euclid.
Peter and Barbara Johnson who       resided in Euclid from 1880-1905.
They also had property in Crookston during       this period.
Photo2 was taken at Skrin Seth in       Crookston Minn.
The card stock is of the same thickness as Skrin Seth photo1,       so perhaps they were taken at the same time roughly.
Maybe man and wife?
Barbara and Peter       Johnson.
E.
Lynne in       Crookston Minn.
I believe it is another photo of the gentleman in Photo2,       but taken at a later date?
Peter and Barbara Johnson.
I would love to be able to get these photo s back to their families.
The first one is of an unknown man.
I m pretty sure that the cane and coat are photographer s props.
Peter and Barbara Johnson .
They resided       in Euclid Minnesota from 1880 to 1905.
This photo was probably taken before       the one of the woman and the one of the man and woman together, as the card       stock is a bit thinner and the studio was S.
JOHNSON, Crookston Minn.
This fellow may have resided in Euclid.
The second photo , I believe is of       a couple on their wedding day.
The woman is wearing the same dress in both       photo s.
She is wearing a jacket in one of them.
The professional archivist       I took this photo to, dates it about 1887.
I think the woman is holding an       envelope, perhaps containing the marriage licence?
This photo was taken by       S.
JOHNSON, Crookston Minn.
This couple may have resided in Euclid.
I would love to reunite these photo s with their family and perhaps find       out if they are related to my family.
The title of the book is Portrait Gallery!
There is no names of the people on them.
Put at the bottom of the photos       is the name of the studio that took the pictures.
The name of the studio       is Rice.
The address is 311 Main Street Worcester, MASS.
The people       in the photos is like people from the 1800 s.
On the back of every photo       is this design and their studios name and logo or something.
It also says       that it is an art studio.
Photos: Late 1800-Early 1900 s unidentified old cardboards from MINNEAPOLIS,       MN I gained access to about 35 professional photos taken in Minneapolis MN       from various studios.

I have three photographs probably showing members but I do not know who they       are and would appreciate any information.
My family has a book about Minnesota and the families that lived there.
In       the book is a photo of an old couple.
If anyone has more       information please let me know.
I think they were called the Wicken family but I am not sure how to spell it.
The oven looked like it was made       out of rocks piled liked a stove with a chimney.
My great uncle Charles Van Rensalaer Clark was a photographer at 206       Central Ave in Minneapolis and also had a studio in Delano, Minnesota in       the late 1800 s to probably the early 1900 s his pictures had CVR Clark Studio s.
We can not locate him and wondering if someone might have any of his pictures       and could date them so then it would give us an idea when he was in the area.
THANKS, Bob Clark.

I have a large group photo of people       standing in the front of BUTTON S BUSINESS COLLEGE AND SHORT HAND       INSTITUTE.
The photo was probably taken about 1900 as one of the       student s is Laura JOHNSON.
She was born in Feb.
1880 and looks to       be about 20 yrs.
The photo was taken by Skrin Seth Crookston Minn.
If anyone would like to see a close up of the group for identification purposes,       I will try my best to scan a close-up and email it.
Any info about this college       would be wonderful to have if anyone has any information!
Here is a photo of an unidentified man ,       he appears to be in a military uniform.

Thanks.
My family got several old photoalbums       from Gausdal in Oppland, Norway .
Some of the photos are from USA.
I do       not know who these people are.
I have made a web-site with the photos and       I hope to get some of them identified.
I would be very happy if you took       time to look at my site.
I have some interesting pictures of weddings and Families that are a part       of the Minnesota History.
Most of them have the names that go with the people.
You can check them out on the web page.
I have several unidentified old photos from Minnesota.
Does anyone know how       I can find the dates that certain photography studios were in business?
This       would help tremendously in identifying some of the photos.

I have a photo of a very handsome young man  late teens or early 20 s  in       a military uniform.
It is in a folder that has a shield on the front with       these words: Qualitas Servitum.
Golling St.
Paul, Minn.
It is not a uniform of St.
Thomas Military or Cretin High       School.
If I knew how to scan and send as an attachment I could do that but       alas, I m not too knowledgeable.
Any suggestions as to what Military school       this might be?
I have place some Minnesota Pictures on line, these are mainly pictures taken       in the 1940 s but there is an unknown WWI soldier and a couple taken at earlier       dates.
My family lived in Canby and Minneota and the surrounding countryside.
I am assuming that is where these pictures were taken.
I also have other       photo s I will be scanning, One is a picture of a first grade class and if       it is my mother s that would be 1932 or 1933, Unknown school.
If you like you can view them at Minnesota Kin Home Page  -       Each photo name has what description was available on it or known about it.
Most of them are unknown to me at this time.
Please look and if you see one you want to put on your page, you can either       save it from the page or I will send an attchment.

I have a problem finding my great-grandmother s brother.
All I have is a       picture of him and his wife, together with the children.
I only know his       and her s first name, unfortunately I don t know what they used for surename       in Minnesota - or which part they lived in.
Is there anywere I can get it       published to see if anyone recognice some of  the people on the picture .
Peder Rasmusen Rød  Roed in American  married Ellen Eriksdatter       Gustad.
1854 in Batnfjord in Moere & Romsdal       county, Ellen was born in 1862 on Averoy in Moere & Romsdal county.
They       were married in 1883 and left for Minnesota in 1894.
Peders parrents.
Rasmus       Eriksen Rød  Roed  and Marit Olsdatter.
Ellens parrents Erik Ingebrigtsen       Flaahammer  also used Gustad as surename  and Anne Arntsdatter Vinje.
Ellens       parrents also left for Minnesota in 1894.
Got an old photo album at garage sale.
Most of the photo s have the city        ZUMBROTA  written on them.
A few other cities as well such as  RED       WING , and  KENYON .
Most of the photo s are wedding picture s, three men,       a young boy, a baby.
The name        LAAGNESS  or  LANGNESS , OLAF.
Anyone who may recognize this album       is welcome to it.
I have a number of family photographs from Minnesota that I would like to       have reunited with their proper families.

For as long as he can remember, Charlie Hales has loved the human energy of an exciting city as well as the natural beauty of the great outdoors.
Watching as the urban core, suburbs and exurbs in his native northern Virginia succumbed to haphazard planning did more than disappoint and frustrate him.
It instilled Charlie with a cause that led to a career.
He earned his degree in political theory from an honors program at the University of Virginia.
After graduating, he climbed in his Plymouth Valiant and pointed toward Portland.
Charlie went to work for the Homebuilders Association of Metropolitan Portland and raised a family in Northeast and Southwest Portland.
But, both at work and in the community, he began to detect hints of the sort of shortsighted development he thought he d left behind back East.
That led to Charlie s 1992 run for City Council.
Almost nobody knew my name,  he recalls,  and I didn t have a great deal of money.
The message at more than 20,000 doors was straightforward:  Portland is about to grow and how we grow is very important.  Charlie was elected that year and twice more.
In the ensuing decade he turned his views into action again and again.
At the Transportation Bureau, Charlie Hales championed light rail expansion, streetcar development and safe bicycle routes to reduce traffic congestion and improve the environment.
At the Parks Bureau, he inspired the first successful bond measure in half a century, then leveraged the funds to raise enough additional money to build or renovate 110 parks in every area of the city.
A decrepit community center in Mount Scott was repaired and outfitted with a swimming pool, the Peninsula Park Center in North Portland was restored, and new community centers rose in East Portland and Southwest Portland.
Charlie left office in 2002 when a nationally prominent engineering firm asked him to replicate some of his successful mass transit efforts in cities around the country.
Cincinnati, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Sacramento, Salt Lake City and Scottsdale.
He has made presentations to civic leaders and planners in Austin, Charlotte, Denver, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Providence and Taipei.
Charlie left Portland for a few years after marrying his wife, Nancy, whose two children were still in high school in Stevenson, Washington.
The family couple returned to Portland where they have poured sweat equity into fixing up a Tudor home in Eastmoreland over the past four years.
Nancy Hales directs First Stop Portland, a program within Portland State University that develops programming and field studies for visiting delegations interested in learning about Portland s urban sustainability.
Charlie is on the boards of Friends of Trees and the Portland Parks Foundation.
He has been a SMART reader, volunteered at Meals on Wheels and served on the Portland Public Market Committee.
His work has been honored by the Bruner Foundation for Urban Excellence, the American Society of Landscape Architects, the Oregon Chapter of the American Planning Association, the League of Oregon Cities and the Portland Bicycle Transportation Alliance.
Charlie and Nancy are proud to have 5 children between them and a cat named Bogart.

Jason has had a circuitous route to the Executive Suite of a diaper company.
He started his career with Nomura Securities in Tokyo as an Equity broker, making tremendous money but not a lot of meaning.
Some would say morally bankrupting him.
He returned to his native Australia to teach Japanese at high school.
This was very meaningful work but alas, it nearly did bankrupt him.
Around that time he met his future wife and together they went dating 200 times.
They co-authored two dating guidebooks to Australia that morphed into  2 s Company  Boutique Event Management, where they organized once in a lifetime romantic events for clients.
A lot of fun but not much history making.
With all the romance, a wedding and babies were inevitable.
And with babies came the question of which diapers to use.
Once they learned that one disposable diaper takes 500 years to biodegrade and that every day 50,000,000 are going into landfill, they were on a mission to find an alternative.
They happened upon a flushable, compostable diaper technology from Tasmania licensed the rights to the rest of the world outside of Australia & NZ, packed up the house, 2 year old son  with one in the oven  and moved 10,000 miles to Portland, Oregon to launch gDiapers.
At last they had found a path to making meaning and money and will hopefully live happily ever after.
Jason is a regular speaker at events including Fortune Green Brainstorm, Net Impact, BALLE and has appeared on programs including Donny Deutsch s  Big Idea  on CNBC and the Today Show.
He is a member of YPO and has been chosen to be on CNBC   YPO s speaking roster.

2007 , Fracture Incidence in GH-Deficient Patients on Complete Hormone Replacement Including GH.
J Bone Miner Res, 22: 1842–1850.
Dr Bengtsson owns stock in Tercica.
Dr Erfurth is a member of the Eli Lilly and Company advisory board.
All other authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.
Introduction: The objective of this study was to evaluate fracture incidence in patients with confirmed growth hormone deficiency  GHD  on replacement therapy  including growth hormone   compared with population controls, while also taking potential confounders and effect modifiers into account.
Materials and Methods: Eight hundred thirty-two patients with GHD and 2581 matched population controls answered a questionnaire about fractures and other background information.
Incidence rate ratio  IRR  and 95% CI for first fracture were estimated.
The median time on GH therapy for childhood onset  CO  GHD men and women was 15 and 12 yr, respectively, and 6 and 5 yr for adult onset  AO  GHD men and women, respectively.
08 .
86  was recorded in AO GHD men.
Conclusions: Increased fracture risk in CO GHD women can most likely be explained by interaction between oral estrogen and the GH–IGF-I axis.
The adequate substitution rate of testosterone  90%  and GH  94%  may have resulted in significantly lower fracture risk in AO GHD men.
Growth hormone  GH  affects linear growth and is important for skeletal development in young adults and for bone turnover in adult skeletal tissue.
1  Reduced BMD has been recorded both in patients with isolated GH deficiency  GHD  and in those with multiple pituitary deficiencies, indicating that GHD per se is responsible for the low BMD in both types of patients.
2,3  There are, however, contradictory results from studies in adult onset GHD  AO GHD  showing both normal BMD, particularly in older subjects,  4,5  and low BMD.
6,7  In contrast, in patients with childhood onset GHD  CO GHD   3,8,9  there seems to be a clear reduction in BMD, which may illustrate the potential role of GH in the acquisition of peak bone mass  PBM .
Skeletal maturation is regulated by estrogens in both boys and girls, and lack of estrogens leads to delayed epiphyseal closure and decreased bone mass.
10  Testosterone acts either directly or indirectly through its effect on muscle mass and has an effect on the overall size of the bone.
11  Decreased bone gain during growth and lower PBM are also important determinants of fractures in the elderly.
12  As substitution therapy with GH has become available for adult patients with GHD, it is important to assess BMD and fracture risk in these patients during periods with and without GH therapy.
It has been shown that GH therapy for 18 or 24 mo resulted in a modest increase of BMD in AO GHD men, whereas no significant changes were observed in AO GHD women.
13  In addition, the treatment response in BMD after 5 yr of GH therapy was more pronounced in CO than in AO GHD patients, but did not fully reach the same level as in AO GHD patients.
Whether the fracture risk among GHD patients differs from that of the general population is not yet firmly established.
Three previous studies  15–17  have reported increased fracture risk among GHD patients, but these conclusions are uncertain because of study design.
The fracture incidence in GHD patients on GH substitution is yet unknown.
Adequate assessment of fracture risk requires not only a large number of patients to reach sufficient statistical power but also proper population controls and adjustment for potential confounders such as BMI,  18,19  smoking habits,  20  dietary intake of calcium,  21  and physical activity.
22–24  Moreover, effect modifiers such as sex and age at GHD diagnosis have to be considered.
The aim of this study was to analyze fracture incidence in a large cohort of patients with confirmed GHD on replacement therapy including GH in comparison with a control cohort from the general population, while taking possible confounders and effect modifiers into account.
Prevalent cases of GHD were recruited from patient registers at departments of Endocrinology at all Swedish University Hospitals  Gothenburg, Linköping, Lund, Malmö, Stockholm, Umeä, and Uppsala , and from one county hospital in Southern Sweden  Kristianstad .
The inclusion criterion was severe GHD by testing  peak GH < 3 μg liter , and some patients underwent more than one test.
Tests included insulin tolerance test  n = 444 , arginine and arginine-insulin tolerance test  n = 219 and 5 , GHRH-arginine  n = 34 , growth hormone releasing hormone  GHRH  tests  n = 29 , and other  n = 94  such as glucagon, clonidine, l-dopa, apomorphine tests, and 24-h GH profile  n = 115 .
7 μg liter.
Eighty-three percent of the patients had a currently recommended test.
26  Among those patients with a today less accurate test, only 3% had less than two other pituitary hormone insufficiencies.
The local representatives of the study group filled in a form for each patient concerning cause of pituitary deficiency and other patient characteristics.
A postal questionnaire was sent to the potential participants in April 2003.
After one follow-up reminder, 866 patients  82%  had responded to the questionnaire.
Sufficient responses to the specific questions on fracture incidence were not obtained from 19 patients, and in 15 patients no start-year of observation could be established.
Thus, the final study group was comprised of 832 patients, of whom 52%  n = 433  were men and 48%  n = 399  were women.
The criterion for CO GHD was diagnosis <18 yr, and for AO GHD, diagnosis ≥18 yr.
Eighty-eight percent  n = 732  had AO GHD and 12%  n = 100  had CO GHD.
The major cause of pituitary deficiencies in AO GHD was nonfunctional pituitary adenoma, and idiopathic GHD dominated among CO GHD  Table 1  .
Figure 1 shows the frequencies of different pituitary substitution therapies at the time of confirmed GHD.
Figure 2 shows pituitary hormone deficiencies and hormone replacement therapies at the end of the study period.
Seventy-seven percent of CO GHD women were sex steroid deficient; 86% of them were on oral contraceptives with estrogens or combinations of estrogens and gestagens and 6% were on transdermal preparations.
In CO GHD women and men, sex steroid substitution was started at a median of 17 yr of age  range, 8–34 and 13–43 yr, respectively .
Seventy-two percent of AO GHD women were sex steroid deficient; 68% of them were on oral contraceptives with estrogens or combinations of estrogens and gestagens and 6% were on transdermal preparations.
In AO GHD men, 90% were on testosterone substitution at the end of the study, and 78% of them were treated with injections of 250 mg testosterone enanthate  every third to fourth week .

For all patients, Statistics Sweden  Sweden s national statistics agency  selected four controls each from the Swedish population register.
The controls were successfully matched for age  same year , sex, county of current residence, and country of birth, but otherwise they were randomly selected.
After two postal follow-up reminders, 2674  78% of those alive and living in Sweden  subjects had responded in November 2003.
Fifty-two controls were excluded because the start-year of observation could not be established for the matched patient.
Moreover, sufficient responses to the specific questions on fracture incidence were not obtained from 41 control subjects.
Thus, the final control cohort was comprised of 2581 subjects.
The participation rate was somewhat higher among women  n = 1273, 77%  than among men  n = 1308, 73% .
Based on information from Statistics Sweden, age, country of birth, marital status, income, and residence in urban or rural area could be compared for the population controls that responded to the questionnaire and for those who did not.
Fifty-seven percent of the participating men were married compared with 40% among the nonparticipants.
Moreover, 38% of the participating men were ≥60 yr of age compared with 46% among the nonparticipants.
Similarly, the participating women were more frequently married compared with the nonparticipants  51% versus 40% , but the percentages of those ≥60 yr of age were rather similar  36% versus 34% .
The discrepancies for the other variables were minor.
Nine percent of controls to CO GHD women were postmenopausal, and 12% of them had sex steroids with estrogens or combinations of estrogens and gestagens.
Sixteen percent of the premenopausal controls had oral contraceptives with estrogens or combinations of estrogens and gestagens.
Sixty-eight percent of the controls to AO GHD women were postmenopausal, and 24% of them had sex steroids with estrogens or combinations of estrogens.
Nine percent of the premenopausal controls had oral contraceptives with estrogens or combinations of estrogens and gestagens.
Age at menopause was 50 yr  range, 38–56 yr .
The same questionnaire was used for both the patient and the control cohorts.
The questions addressed background information such as intake of dairy products, consumption of alcohol, smoking history and physical activity, country of birth, body weight, and height.
Physical activity during work time and leisure time was classified according to a four-grade scale.
The key question concerned history of fractures, specified for age, fracture site, and whether it was traumatic  such as a traffic or ski accident .
The subjects were also asked about visual problems, even when using glasses.
Table 2 shows age-matching to be successful.
The distribution of potential confounders and other individual characteristics with respect to age at GHD onset and sex are also given.
As previously described, CO GHD patients did not reach the same final height as subjects from the general population.
Three follow-up periods  Fig.
3   were defined:  1  from calendar year of confirmed GHD until calendar year of first fracture or as of December 31, 2002  GHD period ;  2  from start of first confirmed pituitary hormone deficiency  FHD  to first fracture or until calendar-year of confirmed GHD  FHD-GHD period ; and  3  from FHD to first fracture or as of December 31, 2002  FHD period .
The same follow-up periods were applied for the matched population controls.

Definition of follow-up periods:  1  GHD period: from year of confirmed GHD to first fracture December 31, 2002;  2  FHD-GHD period: from year of first confirmed pituitary deficiency  FHD  to first fracture or calendar year of confirmed GHD;  3  FHD period: from year of first confirmed FHD to first fracture December 31, 2002;  4  GH therapy: from year of start of GH therapy to December 31, 2002.
Except for periods without GH therapy.
Please note that the length of the periods are shown for the median patient and thus may vary from period to period because the follow-up ends at the first fracture or at December 31, 2002.
Also note that the lengths of the periods are skewed as shown by the 5th to 95th percentiles.
The cumulative incidence of being or having been on GH substitution at the end of follow-up was 100% for CO GHD women, 98% for CO GHD men, 91% for AO GHD women, and 94% for AO GHD men.
Information on the GH dose at end of follow-up was available in 91% of CO GHD women, 89% of CO GHD men, 82% of AO GHD women, and 83% of AO GHD men.
0 mg  in CO GHD men.
6 mg d , respectively.
At the end of the study, the median serum IGF-I levels were available among 81% of the patient groups.
6  in men.
For comparisons between the GHD patients and the population controls  cohort affiliation , the incidence rate ratio  IRR  and 95% CIs for first fracture were estimated with Poisson regression models using EGRET software  Statistics and Epidemiology Research Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA .
A lower limit of the 95% CI above unity is interpreted as a significantly increased fracture incidence.
Likewise, an upper limit of the 95% CI below unity is interpreted as a significantly decreased fracture incidence.
If more than one fracture occurred during the calendar year of the first fracture, the fracture that was counted was decided in the rank order of fracture types given in Table 3 , with osteoporotic fractures first in rank.
This criterion had to be applied for 6 patients and 12 control subjects only.
To assess for possible effect modification, separate analyses were performed for women and men and for patients with AO GHD or CO GHD, respectively.
Smoking habits  ever never , BMI  <20, 20–30, and >30 kg m2 , calcium intake  <250, 250–1000, and >1000 mg d based on intake of dairy products  and physical activity  low and high  were considered potential confounders.
They were included in the model, one at a time, together with cohort affiliation, and were kept in the model if they changed the crude effect estimate by >15%.
08  was observed among AO GHD women  Table 4  .
14 , whereas it was not meaningful to evaluate the risk for the FHD-GHD period, because of too few person-years under risk  Table 4  .
None of the potential confounders qualified for being included in the final models.
Male GHD patients showed a totally different pattern  Table 5  .
83; Table 5  .
The IRR point estimates were similar for CO GHD and AO GHD men, but incidence was significantly decreased in AO GHD men only, whereas the 95% CI for CO GHD men was wider because of limited study group size.
Considering the maximum length observation period  FHD period , the risk was again significantly lower for the AO GHD men but not for CO GHD men.
For the time period between year of start of FHD period and year of start of GHD period  FHD-GHD period , there was a pattern of decreased fracture risk for the AO GHD male patients, but for the CO GHD, the low number did not allow a meaningful evaluation  Table 5  .
None of the potential confounders qualified for being included in the final models.
If a cut-off limit of <25 yr was used instead of <18 yr for defining CO GHD, the results did not change for men or women  data not shown .

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on fracture incidence in patients with confirmed GHD on complete hormone replacement including GH.
The women in this study showed a nonsignificant overall risk increase for fractures, confined to women with CO GHD, who had a more than doubled risk.
Results in men showed a totally different pattern with a generally decreased incidence of fractures reaching significance in AO GHD men.
It must be noted that the study design limits the possibility of separately evaluating effect of GHD on fracture incidence, because the person-years under risk during confirmed GHD without GH substitution  GHD-FHD period; Fig.
3   were too few for a meaningful interpretation of GHD-specific fracture risk.
Even if present GH doses seemed adequate, with higher doses in CO patients than in AO patients and in women compared with men,  29  a somewhat lower SDS IGF-I level was recorded in CO GHD women.
However, patients with CO GHD have shown decreased BMD despite treatment with GH during childhood.
3,7,8,14  Against GHD as the main cause of increased fracture risk among CO GHD women, however, is the lack of a similar finding among CO GHD men.
Increased fracture incidence among CO GHD women might have been caused by discontinuation of GH at growth completion, which may limit attainment of PBM.
30  PBM occurs probably before age 30,  31  but the results did not change in this study if we used a cut-off limit of 25 yr instead of 18 yr for defining CO GHD.
The median age at end of study was only 28 yr in CO GHD women, and thus it is not surprising that the increased fracture risk was confined to nonosteoporotic fracture sites.
It is unlikely that glucocorticoid or thyroxine substitutions could explain increased fracture risk in CO GHD women, because there was no significant sex difference with respect to these hormones  Fig.
2  .
Fifty-seven percent of CO GHD women had adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency and thereby adrenal androgen deficiency, also known to affect bone formation.
Age at start of sex steroid medication was a median of 17 yr for both men and women, and late-onset puberty is related to low PBM in both sexes,  33,34  although it is apparently more deleterious to the female skeleton.
At the end of the study, a higher percentage of CO GHD women  71%  than men  45%  had sex steroid substitutions.
In addition, estrogen insufficiency was clearly more prevalent among CO GHD women than among control women.
It is noteworthy that IGF-I production in the liver is impaired by oral estrogens, also shown by a somewhat lower SDS IGF-I level among CO GHD women, and enhanced by testosterone.
35,36  Thus, a more likely explanation of the increased fracture risk in CO GHD women is estrogen insufficiency and an interaction between oral estrogen and the GH–IGF-I axis during a time window of relevance for bone development and maturation.
Three previous studies have reported increased fracture risk among GHD patients without GH substitution,  15–17  but methodological problems hampered their results.
One problem concerns the use of inadequate disease measures for longitudinal studies  “fracture frequency” or “fracture prevalence” instead of “fracture incidence” .
16,17  Other problems include the choice of comparison populations, with a selected group of “nonosteoporotic” normal subjects,  15  and with groups not completely age matched.
16,17  Finally, a full adjustment for all potential confounders was not made in any of the previous studies.
This patient cohort was based on a cross-section of survivors, but there is no evidence for selective participation among patients alive at the time of inclusion in the study, because the majority of the AO GHD patients had GHD because of a pituitary tumor,  37  and CO GHD patients had craniopharyngioma and idiopathic GHD as a background diagnosis.
The GHD was confirmed after adequate testing in 83% of the patients,  26  and the rest of the patients  except 3%  had at least two additional pituitary deficiencies, which gives a likelihood of being GHD of 91%.
25  Thus, we have no reason to believe that there was any misclassification of hormone deficiencies in this cohort.
Although hormone replacements were administered, some might still have been under- or over-replaced.
We included controls matched for the potential confounders, age, sex, county of residence, and country of birth, and fully adjusted the statistical analysis for these confounders.
However, none qualified for inclusion in the final models.
The participation rate among controls was uniquely high  78%  and very close to that among the patients  82% .
Demographic differences observed between participating and nonparticipating population controls were few and minor.
An optimal control group would have been a group of GHD patients without GH therapy, although such a cohort with comparable background diagnosis or hormonal deficiencies was unavailable in Sweden.
The same questionnaire was sent to both the patient and the control cohorts, thereby reducing risk for differential misclassification of incident fractures.
No independent verification of fracture diagnosis using medical records was performed.
One limitation of this study was the fact that the fractures were self-reported and not confirmed radiologically.
This study is the first to show a significant decrease in the incidence of fractures in AO GHD men with no difference in AO GHD women.
The reason is not known, but it may be speculated that a high substitution rate of testosterone  90%  and GH  94% , with an adequate GH dose shown by the IGF-I SDS level, resulted in lower fracture risk in AO GHD men.
39  In addition, because fractures in men are known to occur during sporting activities and at work,  40  a more cautious lifestyle because of visual problems, together with a higher degree of retirement and sick leave,  41,42  could be one explanation.
However, visual problems were more frequent in GHD patients, irrespective of sex and age of onset.
A limitation of both the statistical power analysis and biological relevance in the present cohort of AO GHD men and women is that they had not yet reached the high incidence age for osteoporotic fractures.
However, previous studies reporting increased fracture risk had even slightly lower ages than in this study.
In conclusion, a doubled fracture incidence risk for nonosteoporotic fractures was recorded in CO GHD women with confirmed GHD on conventional hormone substitution and GH therapy, most likely explained by interaction between oral estrogen replacement and the GH–IGF-I axis.
No increased fracture incidence was observed among CO GHD men and AO GHD women, and a significant decrease in fracture incidence in AO GHD men is possibly explained by adequate substitution rate of testosterone and of GH therapy.

Suburban sprawl is the source of most of our big ticket long term budget liabilities.
So, why aren t we talking about it?
B.
I couldn t agree further.
Ok here s an article that illustrates the inefficiency associated with sprawl perfectly.
At Sprawldfest, I agreed to look for some reading materials.
Here is an article that attempts to break down the additional costs of sprawling development.
You ve hit on something very important.
This is kind of fun I think.
I am not the only one that hates sprawl.
The Sprawl Action Meet-up is now scheduled for August 17th at 6pm.
Danielle,  concerning the role of private investment,  just look at Columbus.
I really like this framing.
Another example of federal funds flowing disproportionately to the suburbs.
FOOD COFFEE AND DRINKS?
I said.
Can I add that that is a 19 percent growth rate over 30 years.
I don t exactly get why I am having to defend my point.
Angie, there is no sprawl in Peninsula.
It had 562 residents in 2010.
I couldn t agree further.
As for where to begin, I would suggest the folks at the Strong Towns network.
They have a number of well-written, well-researched resources and articles.
We ve said it before and we ll say it again: Roads don t pay for themselves.
State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Ok here s an article that illustrates the inefficiency associated with sprawl perfectly.
A 19-mile, 40-minute driving commute  Richfield, Hudson, Avon, Brunswick, Medina  translates into $19 per day in direct costs, plus 80 minutes of time, the equivalent of adding an additional work day per week!
This article is very relevant to this discussion.
At Sprawldfest, I agreed to look for some reading materials.
While no teachers seemed to have anything approaching a course syllabus, everyone seemed to talk about “Makeshift Metropolis: Ideas about Cities’’ by architect and University of Pennsylvania planning professor Witold Rybczynski.
You ve hit on something very important.
And I think it is something that just about all of us can agree on.
When you strip away the debates over where to spend public money, or which political units are more  deserving   in some abstract sense , there is a deep dissatisfaction out there with the American way of living - and  sprawl  is a big part of that.
Lots of everyday people sense it, and musicians and artists have done a good job of capturing it - because it is something that speaks to the heart and the soul, rather than just the body and the mind.
I think that there is something very unnatural about the way that we live in this country and the way that we have structured our urban environments over the past six decades is a part of that - perhaps a symptom, perhaps a cause, perhaps both.
We ve done it because we COULD do it, but there wasn t much discussion back then as to whether we SHOULD do it.
We ve lost most of our sense of community as a result, and we ve ended up with some pretty ugly places - in inner cities as well as suburban areas.
Place, and pride of place really matters.
I think we lose something as a society when we build places that don t have any lasting value.
Houses are not built to last, stores and offices are built in a fly-by-night fashion, and when they are abandoned, they bear mute witness to their own irrelevance.
We have an ugly mass culture, and it is no surprise that we end up with lots of ugly places.
In our first attempt to schedule a meet-up we found that some of our community members were not available to meet on August 11th.
We are floating a few dates, please pick the ones that best fit your schedule using the poll below.
I really like this framing.
Too often, the government s involvement in housing   and other social net issues  is framed in  the context of entitlement programs - specifically those folks who didn t work as hard as I did are still entitled to subsidized housing, food stamps, Medicaid, etc.
This article specifically makes the link across the spectrum of federal monetary involvement in one of those areas  housing individuals , and makes the point that federal subsidies for housing run the gamut from public housing, to rent subsidies, to deductible mortgage interest and property taxes, to tax credits for making your home more energy efficient.
All of those reflect choices we make about where we spend our  collective  tax money - whether it is money going out - or giving me a pass on the income taxes I would otherwise owe if I didn t own a home.
That is a very useful way to look at it that may help move the discussion beyond pitting the haves and have nots against each other.
Both ends of the spectrum are subsidized, so instead of cutting the subsidy only from those receiving money flowing out  - perhaps my subsidy  the tax breaks I get  ought to be cut as well.
FOOD COFFEE AND DRINKS?
Thank you all for participating so passionately in this important conversation.
We’d like to help you take all that passion and begin to turn it into action.
We’ve set aside a date of August 11th at 6pm in our offices at Trinity Commons to get all participants in this conversation and other guests together for a meet up.
We’ll supply the food and drinks and you bring the energy and your best ideas.
The plan is to continue the broad conversation about sprawl and work toward identifying an attainable goal or goals to help move our region forward.
Once you’ve settled on a plan for action, we will help to facilitate your efforts, bringing in other useful voices, suggesting resources and doing whatever else we can to put the wind at your back.
We’re very pleased with all the thoughtful exchanges on our site about the complex and daunting issue of suburban sprawl and we’re excited about harnessing all the great thought to improve life in Northeast Ohio.
Thank you from the whole Civic Commons staff.
Cleveland companies paid to sprawl.
This is how regional planning works in healthy regions.
That is a large part of the challenge here.
That area already has a healthy, well developed, public transportation system and the planning is focused on improving on something that already works well.
Incremental improvements on an already functional system.
That is not where we are.
We have a system that depends, in large part, on private vehicle transportation.
To get from where we are to where it would be ideal to be would require massive investments to create the infrastructure, and the infrastructure wouldn t be immediately useful because we don t currently live in an arrangement designed around the availability of public transportation - because it largely isn t available.
I agree with the goal of reducing urban sprawl - starting at least by encouraging growth in ways that discourage converting farmland into more urban sprawl and encourage concentrating populations in walkable bikeable self sufficient pockets.
I see what you are saying.
Detroit is trying to turn the ship around.
There are people at their state DOT that understand these issues, I will attach a link.
The thing is, this can be incremental.
Proportionally more investment in transit and less in highways will produce good results.
I think one important thing we could do right off the bat is make the city more bike friendly.
That would be investment in our urban infrastructure, something we have completely neglected for three decades.
I like this approach and the vision behind it.
There is a lot that our region could learn from this planning.
But, to put it in context, I would be remiss if I did not add that the Greater Washington MPO, Virginia DOT, Maryland DOT, and the local governments in the region are spending amounts of money that would boggle our collective mind in Northeast Ohio on building new roads and providing new infrastructure to fuel a suburban population boom that makes our relatively paltry pockets of new development  Avon, Mentor, Streetsboro  pale in comparison.
Loudoun County, Prince William County, and northern Montgomery County contain some of the finest examples of suburban sprawl that you will ever see.
C.
At least they have actual growth to justify their sprawl.
Another, thing, I totally disagree with you that these two regions have the same development dynamic.
We are comparing a rapidly growing, strong-market region, with a shrinking, weak market.
It is completely apples to oranges.
Yes, they have sprawl, but they have population growth to warrant some sprawl.
In addition, they have seen tremendous gentrification in their urban areas, with increasing property values.
I just flat out disagree with your premise that they are developing in the same way.
Cleveland s development is characterized by very low-density no-growth sprawl in its outer edges.
DC does have some development of that type but is also has a tremendous amount of high-density urban development.
C.
Northeast Ohio.
Caveat lector.
S.
We happen to have a serious economic problem overlaid upon ours.
MPOs, regional planning agencies, local governments, DOTs, and the public sector in general  which is simultaneously blamed for enabling sprawl and for killing the American Dream by over-regulating and squelching the free market .
Perhaps both have been true at times, but it becomes difficult to separate cause and effect when you are talking about the locational decisions of millions of households and businesses.
Solutions to the problem go well beyond public policy making and the regulatory efforts of government agencies: they involve directly engaging the private sector; specifically the real estate industry, the development community, retailers, and the public at large, with an end goal of returning our society to a community-based, human-scaled, context-sensitive model for designing and building the places that we live, work, and shop.
Jason, don t take my word for it.
I just got off the phone with Myron Orfield today  for my job at Streetsblog .
He is the nation s foremost expert on metropolitan politics and regional planning.
In his book American Metropolitics, he ranked the 50 largest metro regions on varying issues related to smart growth and strategic planning.
He measured the level of inequality, segregation, access to transit, redevelopment, political fragmentation, revenue capacity, office sprawl etc.
If you build giant highways into greenfield areas and you allow those areas to be exclusively zoned, you’re going to have deep segregation.
That’s all there is to it.
San Diego.
Washington DC, Philadelphia are more on the ball than the others.
You look at a place like Washington, a place like Seattle, their cities are alike.
I am sort of at a loss that you would even argue the point that DC s sprawl problem is any way comparable to Cleveland s.
I don t know whether you are misinformed or just trying to downplay the issue because you don t like controversy.
If it is the case that you seriously believe there two regions are similar in this respect, I think it is disappointing for someone in your position, frankly.
The Cleveland region has doubled its footprint over the last few decades without adding ANY population.
The situation in DC, though there was some sprawl, is far, far different.
What do you even mean by  engage the private sector?  I think that is a complete cop out, as it blaming all of our sprawl problems on manufacturing job losses.
I suggest we  engage the private sector  by not building them unnecessary infrastructure with public money.
Or not incentivising them to move to the suburbs.
And Wendell Cox?
For real?
You don t believe in listening to the extremes, then you post an article by Wendell Cox?
That guy is a fraud and not even a good one.
Did he really suggest that Cleveland s sprawl is no better than DCs?
I m sorry, I can t leave this assertion, that Myron Orfield is the nation s  foremost expert on regional planning  unanswered.
I would agree that Orfield is the nation s foremost authority on social and economic  equity and political issues, but that is not planning.
Both of his Metropolitics books concentrate on these issues exclusively.
I  find his notion of  tax capacity  particularly offensive, and it has found its way into the core and purpose of the Regional Prosperity Initiative.
That the non-urban areas are responsible for urban problems, and that they have a moral and financial obligation to put their money and creative efforts back into the cities.
100 electronic trash toters, or $100K City Councilmen with full staff and public pensions.
That will not sell in the suburbs so groups like the RPI have to pretend it is about making us economically competitive,  or saving the environment,  or reducing taxes,  or whatever hot button issue comes up that day, anything other than the real purpose --making suburbanites pay more to support urban lifestyles.
NEO Sewer District fees multiplied many times over.
As much as we hold TC up to be the model, back home in MN, Orfield heaps criticism on the Met Council for not doing enough.
Met Council members, who live and work in the real world  most of them DFLers like Mondale, hardly conservatives  answer to the  foremost expert on regional planning?  Two words:  get real.  Read it for yourself below, or follow the link provided.
The question about whether the metro area s decentralized development pattern hurts its competitiveness is especially touchy.
The Brookings Institution s Bruce Katz raised the issue last year.
University of Minnesota Law School Professor Myron Orfield wrote a book about it this year.
And last week, in a Cityscape interview, he suggested that the council was partly to blame.
By strictly enforcing its authority over local zoning, the council could have prevented much of the commercial and business development on the edge while retaining jobs and vitality in older communities, Orfield said.
Severe concentrations of poverty in the inner cities and suburbs might have been averted, he added.
The result has been harmful to the region s ability to compete for new prosperity.
Dispersing jobs away from downtowns and other clusters renders transit ineffective.
Moreover, decentralization is costly and inefficient, both for families and for governments responsible for infrastructure.
That s the critique.
Bell said he understands Orfield s argument.
What s required, he said, is a balance among social equity, efficiency and the aspirations of suburbs.
Bell said he thinks the right balance has been struck.
He said he doubts that land-use planning can be successfully used to break up concentrations of poverty.
The root problem isn t geography, he said.
It s lack of social structures like marriage, personal responsibility and educational values.
Johnson agreed, especially on the education component.
He said that Orfield talks as if suburbs were a mistake.
The subsidies that suburbs enjoy may well be offset by the weighty bureaucracies that hinder redevelopment in the central cities, he added.
Mondale suggested that Orfield s views are colored by academia rather than real-world experience.
Well I have to give you credit for knowing who that guy is.
I guess I disagree with your point, however.
I don t see how  limiting the aspirations of the suburbs  is such an egregious crime.
One one hand you have equity, competitiveness, environmental health.
On the other hand you have the  aspirations of the suburbs  to build some mcmansions and develop their tax base so that they can hire more bureaucrats.
I think the Cleveland suburbs have been given sufficient leverage to pursue their aspirations.
In fact too much, they will continue to destroying the region without some type of control.
You might be right that  it won t fly here.  If that is so, this region is doomed to further decline and a slow, ugly death.
I can see you re upset that anyone even suggest the suburbs chip in to help lift up the region more generally.
I am a lifelong resident of inner city Akron, except for the two years that I was in graduate school in North Carolina.
I moved back here because I love this region, and I love my city.
The sunbelt was not for me.
I love the look and smell of the Cuyahoga Valley on an early-summer morning bike ride, and I loved the pungent smell of rubber in the air when I was a small child.
I love wandering through Glendale cemetery taking photos and soaking in the history and experiencing the nearly palpable sensation of the spirits of great people that built a great city.
I love the little, unexpected things that you can find biking through this place  a small Jewish cemetery nestled within an inner-city near-southwest side neighborhood; a set of stone stairs built by the WPA, built up a steep hillside that doesn t seem to go anywhere in particular; a brick apartment building decorated with a swastika-like brick pattern  built years before the Nazis came to power, but weird and disturbing nevertheless .
The good, the bad, and the weird.
This is the city that launched a group of guys wearing plastic flowerpots on their heads to a brief flirtation with rock stardom.
This is the city where a hometown girl, quite critical of this place, nevertheless wears it on her sleeve, and opens a darn good vegan  of all things, in this blue-collar town  restaurant.
This is the city where people extinguished their cigarettes in little ashtrays made to look like a rubber tire.
All these quirky things make us  Akron, and Cleveland, and all of Northeast Ohio  what we are.
Those of us that were born here know it well.
Those of us that moved here, and loved it, and stayed, may know it even better.
I have seen my city lose 75,000 residents.
I have seen the public schools in my neighborhood struggle.
I have seen the affect that massive job losses in the rubber and tire industry had on family members and friends.
I have seen dreams die and hopes dashed.
I have seen most of my friends from high school move away for economic opportunities elsewhere.
They left, not because of urban sprawl, but because they couldn t find a job.
But I have also seen Akron residents, black and white, young and old, rich and poor, working together to solve problems.
I ve seen a mayor that is not afraid to do what he thinks is right, even if it ruffles lots of feathers.
I ve seen leaders from local communities; suburban, urban, and rural working together and devoting their unpaid personal time to trying to stitch this place back together.
I ve seen people in my community create clothing, and artwork, and authentic places that celebrate what makes Akron a quality place, in spite of its problems.
Similar efforts go on all across this region.
I know first-hand that we have lots and lots and lots of problems.
But we also have lots and lots of resources and strength.
I m in it for the long haul.
I plan on dying here, I plan on it not being for a long time, and I plan on exercising lots of patience, and longsuffering, and weathering lots of setbacks along the way.
Yeah, but the parts that are closer to the city are built out.
It s good to preserve that land.
But that does nothing for our transit system.
That does nothing for vitality in the central city.
That has little impact on total infrastructure costs.
It does nothing to reduce car dependency.
Those are the factors that will separate competitive cities from not competitive ones in the coming decades.
This is an excellent point.
The creation of the CVNP is probably the most progressive, forward-thinking land use planning that has ever been done in Northeast Ohio.
S.
The regional transportation plans in Cleveland and Akron in the 1960s had a new freeway going right up the Cuyahoga Valley.
Despite all the missteps and mistakes that were made in the 1960s and 1970s, the region managed to get this one right, and instead of a new freeway, we ended up with a beautiful park.
Out-of-town visitors are always amazed at how rural and undeveloped the land between Cleveland and Akron is.
It is difficult to find another example of two cities this large, this close together, with so little intensive development between them.
I m not upset we have a national park.
I m just concerned that sprawl has been a byproduct in Peninsula and that region.
Of course it s good that that land was preserved.
But there are strategies to preserve land that have a much greater regional impact.
Those are strategies that concentrate development in urban areas, rather than carve out a small island for preservation in a sea of low-density, unsustainable development.
Angie, there is no sprawl in Peninsula.
It had 562 residents in 2010.
It had 692 residents in 1970.
There is virtually no commercial development, unless you count the Winking Lizard or Century Cycles, neither of which factor into my personal definition of retail sprawl.
Peninsula has lost population, as has Boston Township , as the CVNP has bought-out older residences and converted residential land into parkland.
In the 2010 census, Boston Township had 707, Boston Heights had 1,300, Richfield Township had 2,517, Richfield had 3,648, and Bath Township had 9,702 residents.
Counting Peninsula, this is a grand total of 18,436 residents.
In 1970, these six communities had a combined 15,537 residents.
3,000 additional residents  probably 1,000 new houses, when you factor in changing household size  over a period of 40 years is hardly sprawling growth.
In fact, more people have moved to Avon in the last few years than have moved to these six CVNP communities in the past 40 years.
They are all zoned to prevent wide-spread residential growth.
None of them, other than the southern edge of Bath  the infamous Montrose area  have any large-scale retail development.
All of these communities have taken active steps to discourage residential and retail development.
The National Park has been a catalyst for preventing sprawl in these communities.
They largely want to stay exurban and rural.
So, people are not moving to these communities to be close to the park.
It is not attracting residential development.
In fact, most of the park’s visitors come from more distant communities, and the Towpath has allowed urban core residents, like me, to directly access the park without ever getting in a car if they so choose.
There are sprawl-related issues that DO affect the park, especially its eastern-edge, but these revolve primarily around new residential and commercial development in more distant communities  Cuyahoga Falls, Stow, Hudson  that create stormwater runoff problems in the Cuyahoga River watershed and its tributaries, such as Mud Brook and Brandywine Creek.
Communities are beginning to come together on these issues by creating the Cuyahoga River Remidial Action Plan, and Hudson has, over the past decade, imposed a virtual moratorium on new development, due in part to its proximity to this sensitive watershed.
We looked at Peninsula as a case study in development pressure in my grad school planning course.
My planning professor said was in a position to either become the next Streetsboro or the next Hudson.
Although she pointed out that there are limits on what can be developed because of parklands  thankfully .
She said development was flowing that way from every direction and that change was inevitable.
I don t exactly get why I am having to defend my point.
Jason, are you arguing that sprawl is not a problem in Summit County?
And also arguing that NOACA is an effective regional planning agency  see website link above ?
Ryan are you really arguing that NEO has progressive land use policies just because we have parklands in our urbanized area?
Exactly what regions are we progressive compared to?
This is making me tired.
Can I add that that is a 19 percent growth rate over 30 years.
Not staggering, but not too shabby for a region that s been effectively stable over that time.
This has worsened inequity and made jobs unreachable for many residents.
It is insane to subsidize such a destructive pattern!
George, that $40 million is just a drop in the bucket.
The public contributed many more millions to build infrastructure to service these new more sprawling job centers.
It has cost our transit system dearly, and made it less effective.
The issue here isn t really the lost taxes, it s that they were spent subsidizing a very destructive end.
This kind of sprawl makes work inaccessible for poor urban dwellers, worsening inequality.
Did you know there is a 35-year difference in life expectancy between someone who lives in Hough and someone who lives a few miles a way in Lyndhurst?
That is the type of gross inequality, and concentrated poverty, that results from policies of this type.
Sprawl of this type also worsens our air quality, that is a major public health concern here.
All of those would be a great, great start and would really put us on a more sustainable, competitive path.
A fix-it-first policy at the regional level for infrastructure would be a huge improvement, and frankly the only fiscally responsible way to proceed.
We should absolutely end tax breaks for job sprawl and strengthen incentives for infill development -- a lot.
Any expansion of our current infrastructure should be subject to a thorough cost-benefit analysis and costs should be shifted to the developer in monetary terms.
I know it s scattered but our development patterns effect environmental quality, equity, regional competitiveness and many other quality of life and health factors.
This is just such a large topic.
I agree with George - the  problem  of jobs moving out of urban areas is is overstated.
At least, it is not a current problem, over the past ten years.
Look at the maps in the Good Jobs First study and follow the arrows, there was little if no subsidized movement from Cleveland.
Those jobs left decades ago.
This is a long response,  but I source everything.
Here it is in a nutshell: proponents of Smart Growth like those that sponsored this study are not open about their objectives, making their  conclusions highly suspect.
Good Jobs First was trying to make a case for government creating sprawl, but there own data doesn t back it up, so we are left with headlines and sound bites to fill in the gaps for us.
And who is filing in the gaps -who  is Good Jobs First?
Studies by Good Jobs First show that suburban sprawl is a broadly anti-union phenomenon.
While each industry has its particulars, across the board, as jobs thin out geographically, away from cities, they also tend to de-unionize.
I don t have a problem it is is union-backed, or  economic equity - backed or whatever.
I have a BIG problem with these organizations and studies that hide their ulterior motives.
You don t want to start on distributional politics.
I think you want to come in and say: Here is a goal we want to reach as a state.
We want to preserve our land and rebuild places we have invested in.
Everyone who is involved, the cognoscenti, know exactly what is going on.
But I think the other approach gets into the lowest common denominator allocation politics which I think you want to avoid.
We do have distributional politics right now.
We redistribute wealth from urban areas to suburban and exurban.
That was what the study found.
Government tax breaks to move out.
I don t think this author understands what a Ponzi scheme is; there s no long-term obligation in such a scheme, just a  falsely  promised return on investment.
Last Friday 6 10, a number of these topics came up at the NOACA summit.
I was waiting for NOACA to post video of the event, so I could link to it, but that hasn t happened yet.
At any rate, I m afraid I can t summarize the whole thing, but I will say a thing or two about the panel I moderated about the Sustainable Communities Consortium.
Jason Segedy of AMATS  who is present in this conversation , Hunter Morrison of the SCC and Ned Hill of CSU were on the panel, and there was a big eye opener for me.
There seemed to be consensus among these three--people who I would have classified as  urbanists  -- that the Woodmeres, Richfields and Twinsburgs of the region have a right to exist and people hav a right to live there.
The planning collaboration that the HUD grant is for won t be about getting the region to rally around the metros.
Jason, please correct me if I ve misunderstood anything .
It will be about acknowledging that people who choose the suburbs and exurbs do so for legitimate reasons and the challenge we have is to make all these places better, more livable, more walkable and better connected to one another.
Last year, NOACA didn t post video from its summit until mid-July, and the clips covered only a couple speakers.
I have a lot of respect for Richard Florida, but I do think that he overstates and oversells the  creative class  idea.
Cities throughout our region have spent a lot of time and money pursuing the elusive ideal of  creativity .
I have always believed that to attract people  creatives and mere mortals  you need to create jobs.
The people can then take care of making your city cool, vibrant, relevant, hip, etc.
It s the people that create the social fabric.
We could use new blood in this area, but I don t think it will come from making our cities  cool .
They are already  cool  if you know where to look, and  cool  is kind of beside the point.
What we need are jobs and economic growth.
This will bring immigrants.
This will bring  creatives .
This will even bring regular old people from rural communities looking for work.
This is how our cities in this part of the world  the Great Lakes  were built: foreign immigrants and rural Americans.
They came from Poland, Hungary, Italy, and Serbia.
They came from West Virginia, Kentucky, and Western Pennsylvania.
Maybe tomorrow they ll come from Mexico, Iraq, Russia, Vietnam, Buffalo, and Detroit.
There are only so many  creative  people to go around.
Sure, we should try to attract them, but in the final analysis, people come for a job.
More importantly, they are more likely to stay if they have a good job.
Florida has done a great job of dissuading regions like ours from  smoke-stack chasing  and coming to grips with the fact that we may never be the industrial powerhouse we once were, but he has replaced this form of one-sided economic development with another:  talent chasing   as if the only talented people were those with advanced degrees, a penchant for gardein pesto, and the latest Vampire Weekend download on their iPad .
Dan, I think that your sense of the panel discussion at the NOACA Summit is accurate.
If we would have had a bit more time, I think there is more nuance to describe our challenges regarding striking the appropriate balance between being responsive to the needs and the reality of the suburbs versus the needs and challenges of the urban core.
Perhaps I can clarify my own point of view a bit further here.
In a perfect world, and with a really good time machine, I would love to go back to 1950, or so, and shake the planners, developers, citizens, and elected officials by the shoulders and show them a vision of what Northeast Ohio would like in 2011.
Is what we have today  a gutted Cleveland and Youngstown, a struggling Akron and Canton, a regional debate over sewers, and stormwater, and new interchanges  what they really intended when they were sowing those fallow farm fields with seeds that reaped a bumper crop of Cape Cods and drive-throughs and strip malls.
Probably not.
Hunter Morrison was right that the factors which led to the upcoming construction of the Avon interchange were put into motion in the 1950s.
Hindsight is 20-20.
We had the automobile.
And cheap gas.
We could sprawl.
So we did.
Just like every other metro area in the country.
We just happen to have the added disconnect of a particulary challenging economic environment and no new population growth.
We, along with Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Detroit, are virtually unique in that sense.
However, we don t have the luxury of time travel.
So I think that the issue we are grappling with is this: Look, we have a reality whether idealist planners such as myself like it or not, that most of the region s population doesn t live in our urban core communities.
It is unrealistic and counterproductive in my mind to demonize people for lifestyle and housing choices that are not just about aesthetics or lot sizes, but are inextricably intertwined with issues of educational opportunity, class, race, crime  or the perception thereof , etc.
Complicating matters even further is the fact that not all  suburbs  are created equal - there is a big difference in walkability, and the potential for sustainable development between, say, Kent and Brimfield or Hudson and Streetsboro.
So where do we go from here?
I would argue that we need an approach that points out the costs of new infrastructure  as Angie and Brad have stated  and that does everything that we can to encourage the revitalization of our core cities, but that also acknowledges the existence and needs of our suburban communities.
I think this means that we simultaneously pursue a three-pronged approach: 1  revitalize and encourage redevelopment of our urban cores; 2  retrofit and densify and encourage mixed-use in our suburbs  easier in some communities than others ; and 3  make a concerted effort to keep rural areas rural.
There are lots of potential contradictions and varying degrees of ideological impurity in this approach, but I think that it is the only way forward.
The Northeast Ohio Sustainable Communities Consortium will certainly be instrumental to moving forward on a vision for coming to grips with the issue of urban sprawl.
My hope is that it will follow the the three-pronged approach that I have outlined here.
Obviously we have a lot of work to do to put flesh on those bones, but it is a start.
In the meantime, AMATS, my planning organization here in Akron has been promoting sustainable development, with a particular focus on integrating land use and transportation planning, as part of our Connecting Communities initiative.
I am also involved right now with a group of planners and local officials involved in what we call our Land Use Community of Practice.
We are currently focusing on the State Route 8 corridor in Summit County between Steels Corners Road and I-271.
It is a suburban area prime for development and we have a pilot project underway to help us better understand the dynamic in this corridor and to see if we can help promote its development in a sustainable way.
It is a test-case to see if the principles of smart growth and sustainable development can be applied strategically in a suburban setting.
There are lots of other similar pilot projects that should be pursued throughout our entire region.
I would like to see a pilot centered around working with the real estate development industry to promote widespread large-scale rebuilding of our urban neighborhoods in Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown, and Canton.
In Akron, for example, if you want to buy a brand new house with modern amenities, you are virtually condemned to have to look in the suburbs.
Akron is fortunate to have an extremely high quality of housing stock for a central city  especially in its Northwest quadrant , but many consumers want a brand new house with modern amenities.
Ironically, these are typically marketed to  Young Professionals .
Hence, many of these projects go belly-up or remain severely underutilized.
Very nice analysis.
I d been thinking along the same lines in terms of the problem.
We re not working with a clean slate here, and it is way too costly in a whole lot of ways to move everyone everything to where it  ideally would be  and build all the infrastructure .
I  hadn t managed to bet beyond the enormity of where we are versus where we ought to be for sustainability to even start thinking about which direction to point the car  or transit lines .
Nobody is demonizing suburbanites.
I certainly don t blame suburbanites for this pattern.
I blame our leadership.
One caveat: I do think this is stoked by a hysteria about crime based on racial stereotypes that are stoked by the media.
But that is an aside.
Suburbs exist yes.
That doesn t mean our region needs to pour 90 percent of it s resources into the outmost edges of our developed area, undermining equity, sustainability, financial health, historical value and common sense, as we have been doing.
I am glad you seem to acknowledge this.
You say we wish we could go back in time.
Planning efforts should be proactive, not reactive.
The tail is wagging the dog in this region.
Leadership is not throwing up your hands after the fact and saying there s nothing we can do about it because it s already happened.
As I argue below, we could spend 100% of our resources in central cities  which don t happen to contain 100% of our residents  and there will still be sprawl.
The key to urban core revitalization is creating places that people want to be.
And while spending lots of money can help, it is highly overrated as a strategy for urban growth.
Our MPO is spending over one year s entire allocation of federal funds  nearly $19 million  on infrastructure improvements related to Goodyear s new world headquarters in Akron.
This is a tremendously important investment in Akron s future, and something that we are proud to be doing.
But it will take more than infrastructure investments to make our central cities attractive places.
It is about placemaking, and urban design, and good planning.
Akron, in conjunction with the University Park Alliance, is starting to do this.
They are doing it in Kent, too, and there is money being invested there, but that s not what it s primarily about.
It is about creating attractive places.
Eventually it has to also be about improving public schools, and working with the private sector to build marketable housing, because if it s not, it will fail.
I don t want to see  theme parks  that remind us of what urban places used to look like.
I want to see actual vibrant urban places, and creating them is a lot harder than just spending money in one political unit and not spending it in another.
First off, I would never say Richfield or Brunswick don t have a right to exist.
I would say they don t have a right to grow.
Or if they do continue to grow, the results will be devastating for the entire region: think multiple digit population losses in the central city, continued population loss in the inner-ring suburbs, declining national competitiveness of the region, etc.
I watched those videos and I didn t get a clear sense of what they were planning at all.
Airports?
Seriously?
Airports are a big concern in this region?
Has anyone seen the roads in Cleveland lately, or Cleveland Heights for that matter?
I think that is a bigger concern.
What is the plan to maintain our current built infrastructure?
What do airports have to do with sustainability and equity, the stated goals of this initiative?
What is our plan past peak oil?
Anyone?
This is what other cities, competitive cities, are grappling with.
And also, I am disappointed by the complete lack of diversity on this panel.
Doesn t NOACA have anyone in a leadership position that isn t an old white man?
Oh, I m not so sure about the  ready to die  part.
I ride my bike on Akron streets quite a bit.
And it is really important to have made your peace as you ride on West Market Street in Montrose in seven lanes of traffic.
It is a toss-up as to whether you will be driven to suicide by the depressing streetscape, or whether you will get tagged by an angry driver in a monster truck telling you to  ride on the sidewalk   there are none, and it s illegal .
Angie, do you really think growth in Brunswick and Richfield is the direct cause of population loss in Cleveland?
The two are related, but only tangentially.
You are taking an incredibly complicated dynamic and oversimplifying it.
Every metro area in the country has many growing suburbs, regardless of whether the central city is growing or not.
You will find new suburban growth in greater New York, Washington, and  yes  even in Minneapolis and Portland.
And these are all regions with healthy economies and growing central cities.
Our economy isn t healthy.
And while sprawl  and high infrastructure costs  are exacerbating the situation, the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the Steel and Rubber industries, resulting from global economic restructuring is a much bigger culprit.
And, yes, poor leadership, and racism, and a complacent attitude in the 1970s and 80s didn t help.
But C est la vie.
I would argue that Cleveland would be losing population  due to shrinking household size alone  regardless of whether Brunswick or Richfield even existed.
Cleveland cannot attract middle class families in large numbers, because it has terrible public schools  one can argue about why that is, but the fact remains  and it does not have a large enough stock of marketable housing.
Change these two dynamics, and even with fears about crime  founded or not  and latent racism, Cleveland starts to grow again.
Without fixing these two things, it doesn t.
But to imply that limiting growth in the suburbs is automatically good for Cleveland, is quite a leap of faith.
A strategy like you are proposing will just backfire and be even worse for the region.
We need a new way forward.
Sprawl is more than a simple relocation of homes and businesses from one central place to many others.
It is an entire set of inextricably connected social and economic linkages all centered around housing preference, school quality, and usage of the automobile.
Other American cities have growing suburbs and the results aren t  devastating  for the entire region.
Or are they?
And what is the plan in those regions for dealing with peak oil?
Do you see where I am going with this?
Yes, we need leadership, and yes sprawl is a bad idea in my opinion, and, yes, I appreciate your idealism, but in your admirable zeal for revitalizing our cities  something we share , you are mis-portraying something incredibly complicated, and gray, and difficult, as something simple, black-and-white, and easy.
True leadership means acknowledging these facts, winning the battles you can, persuasion  rather than demagoguery , consensus-building, and true openness and transparency, which considers all points of view, and makes compromises which are likely to anger those on both the far left and far right.
A good leader is not afraid to make hard choices, but is also wise enough to know their own limitations.
You can credit industrial decline for the loss in the regional population, or stagnation, depending on the decade.
That adds up to a pretty paltry sum.
The loss of the central city population is directly related to disinvestment there and the conscious development of unneeded additional communities in undeveloped lands.
We have 20 percent growth in our exurban regions, a  nearly  stagnant regional population, and double digit losses in the central city, and some inner ring suburbs.
Clearly, sprawl is the major cause of most of our abandonment issues.
Jason, you can imply that I am naive and idealistic and a demagogue, if you want.
But the truth is, I know what I am talking about.
I have a master s degree in urban planning.
I am a national writer on the topics of land use and transportation planning and I am in tune with what s going on around the nation.
In addition, I worked at NOACA and know a great deal about how it functions.
What I am saying is exactly what Richard Florida is saying and what Kaid Benfield at the Natural Resources Defense Council is saying.
See the link below.
I think your lecture about leadership is patronizing.
NOACA making any hard compromises.
I see NOACA operating largely outside the public eye expanding our infrastructure network with little regard for the sustainability or social outcomes of their actions.
If NOACA was actually making hard compromises, every single one of its actions wouldn t be approved unanimously, as you know is the case.
It is dominated by suburban leaders who bargain with eachother to see who can bring home the most money to their community, with no regard for the health of the region overall.
MPOs have their limitations but some are very effective.
Akron is way ahead.
Minneapolis is a leader.
Portland as well.
I know you have to defend NOACA because you are part of the same club.
But if I ve said anything inaccurate about NOACA, they are free to refute it in this forum.
So far they have not.
So far, no one has refuted anything I ve said about NOACA.
You re not making an enemy of me.
We have some differences of opinion on how to go about doing so, but I respect your desire to make this region a better place.
If you didn t care, you wouldn t be here.
I also think that you bring a valuable perspective to the conversation, because you are not part of  the system , and you are not worried about offending the status-quo.
We do have a  small-c  conservative culture in this region, which, even under the best of circumstances, is slow to try new things.
There is nothing wrong with shaking things up, especially in an online forum designed to stimulate debate and discussion.
And another thing, what incentive is there for housing developers to build modern housing in Cleveland when the MPO will take federal money, and build new infrastructure for them to an undeveloped area?
Why should they bother with property acquisition and demolition when the region is rolling out the red carpet for them in all our most fertile farmland?
The answer is they don t.
That is the problem.
That is how NOACA has fueled the exodus from the city and the inner-ring suburbs.
That is how we ended up with an urbanized area the size of a European Country and twice the infrastructure expenses without any economic or population growth.

Via Wikipedia: In economics, rent-seeking is an attempt to derive economic rent by manipulating the social or political environment in which economic activities occur, rather than by adding value.
This is what they really is really occurring in  economic development  shops in Richfield and Brunswick.
I mentioned above that regardless of what the public sector does  short of a radically redefining private property rights , the effort to stop, slow, or reverse urban sprawl is incomplete without a heartfelt desire on the part of the general public and the private sector to build and develop land differently than we do today.
If we really want sustainable planning, we need to create a viable market-based model for sustainable development and we need a true cultural sea-change in the way that we approach planning in America.
Planning today is primarily a regulatory and bureaucratic enterprise.
It lacks vision and is a fragmented, rather than holistic discipline.
It is viewed as a science rather than an art.
It wasn’t always so, as anyone that walks through an 18th century New England town can attest to.
One would be hard pressed to say that New Englanders did not value personal freedom, private enterprise, or liberty, or that they found onerous taxation any less odious than today’s tea partiers, but they still managed to have a vibrant culture of place-based planning that better understood the relationship between the public and the private sphere.
There was a recognition that what you did with your own property affected everyone else.
There are large swaths of our country and region that have lost this ethos of human-scale, community-focused planning.
The private sector and public sector  and the public at large  have been culpable  or at least complicit  in allowing this to happen.
We don’t place a strong value on coordinated planning in this country, and  alas  a disjointed patchwork of sprawling development is what we end up with.
You make a good point.
I think the easiest and fairest way to advance cultural change is not to use public money to make new development more affordable than it truly is.
A lot of this sprawl is people responding to economic incentives.
I mentioned above, low local property taxes.
Equity is a touchy subject, as you can imagine, Angie.
If most users of a public service are poor  like buses, or food stamps , it s hard to separate advocacy of better funding for those services from advocacy of poverty relief in general.
And it s hard to walk the line between providing high-quality basic services to the poor and letting those same services become part of the poverty cycle, by strengthening incentives to stay poor.
I m not trying to dissuade us  as a larger culture or on this site  from collectively mustering the courage to confront structural inequity or the burdens of poverty, but I m saying it s politically complex, and often so emotionally tainted, it can distract from the debate.
To a significant  and often vocal  slice of the population, spending any public resources on a service used mostly by the poor is wasteful; they can shift a debate over the economic merits of social policy in a quick flash.
Ah, I see what you are saying.
Sure, when measured by carbon emissions per acre, Lakewood is higher than Brecksville, because a h**l of a lot more people live in an acre in Lakewood than Brecksville.
The maps are an intriguing resource - but I would need to know more about the assumptions made in the modeling before they would be much more than a conversation starter.
The maps are models, rather than a compilation of data, and models are only as good as the assumptions used to create them.
I could not find anything explicit about the models used for the CO2 emission maps.
5 metric tons at one location .
That is what got me searching for where the data came from.
Another model would be to use the actual emissions - for example associated with I-480  high , and attribute them to households in the surrounding area  very low .
Presuming the former  which is more likely from the little bit of time I spent looking at what explanation I could find , my own choices and that of a co-worker would suggest that relatively logical personal choices probably limit the model s accuracy.
3 MPG is built into the model  The site doesn t permit deep linking, but you can find it in the glossary .
But my behavior is not average - and is influenced heavily by the distance I drive to work - as is that of a co-worker.
We ve talked about it in the past - so I know why each of us has made the vehicle choice we have.
Because I live 27 miles from work, without access to public transportation, I choose to drive a car which gets around 54 mpg  lifetime average mileage - tank average varies from 50 mpg to 62 mpg .
My co-worker lives within walking distance, and drives a vehicle  when he drives  which gets around 16 mpg.
He never goes far, so he doesn t really care that his vehicle gets lousy gas mileage.
3 mpg to determine my CO2 emissions makes it more than double the already bad reality - and on the flip side it also makes my co-worker s good  central city  carbon footprint look better than it is.
Well, sure, they are approximate.
There are very few  stereotypical  or  average  people in reality; one of my favorite bad-urban-design stories is a friend who lived and worked in two of the most walkable neighborhoods in Cleveland  Ohio City and Coventry Village  but still had to commute every day because there was no bus line between them  and by car, no less, because she often had to carry big packages and such .
So these are necessarily just averages and approximations.
What I am suggesting is actually worse.
CO2 emissions are fairly directly related to gas mileage.
They appear to have used an country-wide average gas mileage in their model to predict CO2 emissions on a localized  census track  basis.
A model is only predictive in a geographic area in which the underlying data is also accurate  on average .
If you use the average SAT score in the Cuyahoga County area as part of a model for predicting academic success, the conclusions you reach might be valid  on average  for Cuyahoga County, but the model would probably be wildly inaccurate to use to distinguish between, say, Shaker Heights and East Cleveland.
If, as I suspect, people who live farther from public transportation  have long personal-vehicle-commutes  also  tend to purchase lower gas mileage cars, using a country wide average gas mileage to predict CO2 emissions on a census tract basis will be similarly inaccurate.
If the model uses the average to predict over the region the average applies to, you are correct - there will always be people who don t fit the average - but the model on the whole will be accurate for the region.
If you use an average that is not valid for the region you are making predictions about, not only will there be outliers from the average - but the prediction  on average  will also be wrong.
I am a mathematician by training, and although I haven t done a lot of real world modeling I am familiar with what makes a good model, and what makes one less valuable.
When I come across a model, I always look for where the numbers come, and what assumptions they were based on.
The site doesn t give much specific information about its model  other than gas mileage , so that was all I could check - and using a country wide gas mileage to predict CO2 emissions on a census tract basis raises some flags for me.
And you have pointed out another concern that I have  without access to enough information about the model to check out .
What assumptions did they make in the model about residence v.
Just because one lives in a walkable area, or an area with easy access to public transportation, doesn t mean one s work is in close to home - or in an area to which one can travel by public transportation.
In making their model, they could have sufficiently large but localized sampling to build the model - or not.
Overall, the model doesn t appear to be much more than a measure of how far one lives from public  transportation access.
That is useful information - but not precisely what the map indicates it is modeling.
Statewide  Nelsonville bypass  and locally  Nagel Road interchange, Seasons Road interchange  we are continuing to build new infrastructure to open up new land for development.
DOTs, MPOs, and local governments continue to make these decisions largely due to two factors: 1  congestion and safety problems resulting from existing development pressures; and 2  pressure from suburban communities desiring the increased tax revenue that will come from opening new land for development.
Until we get a handle on the land use component of this; the public pressure for fixing existing congestion problems, and the suburban desire for attracting new development will probably continue to drive transportation policy.
Our MPO has adopted a  fix-it-first  policy.
While it is not perfect, it is a start.
I have also attached two links to some of my thoughts on several transportation policy issues relating to how we allocate our funds.
I think the media plays an important role and they have not given any emphasis to this issue.
We need to start having a higher level conversation about these issues.
I don t see the Plain Dealer filling that role, however.
Much less the television news.
Great points, Brad.
I agree that we started the conversation out talking about costs and have lost the thread.
I think in order to campaign for policies that will change development patterns, we need to know the numbers.
What are the costs of water and sewer extension?
In my opinion, I think one of the hardest parts of this conversation is that it is complex; its not about financials alone but also preferences.
I think most people will agree that tearing down lots of trees and lost farmland is bad, and that we need to figure out a way to keep older cities like Cleveland and the inner ring from going broke and crumbling.
So if I am right in making that assumption, then we should start building consensus and working on a campaign to pinpoint specific costs and propose solutions.
That will take more than banging fists on tables and demanding change, it will take education and community building.
1.
We need to make sure that there is a heavy awareness component that involves media in a greater way2.
We should be careful about relying too heavily on experts - let s get the public directly involved3.
Is that right?
Off hand, I m not a fan of that game idea.
It might be a little patronizing.
People in other regions get this.
Like in Portland, ordinary people go around talking about induced demand.
I think it will be hard to change the culture in Cleveland.
Cleveland is not very well educated compared to some regions.
Also, there is a very ingrained mentality that moving out means moving up.
I have another suggestion.
How about shaking up the leadership structure.
What is the board that is overseeing this like?
It there anyone under the age of 45 represented?
Is it sufficiently diverse?
I think a big part of our problem in Cleveland is that our leadership is stale.
They aren t well versed in what s going on elsewhere, what are the latest developments in the planning field.
Angie, I wonder how different Northeast Ohioans really are.
I suspect that there does, in fact, exist a pretty unique culture in Portland.
However, my conversations with people in the Twin Cities  where they have more progressive land use tax sharing policies  and elsewhere still debate a lot of the same issues.
In other words, I think we ought to give our folks the benefit of the date and believe that we good information and a structured process, they can make good judgments about balancing individual rights versus redundant  and often subsidized  infrastructure.
With respect to the diversity of conversation.
I am pleased that the governing board of the Sustainable Communties Initiative has broad representation, including people from Housing Authorities, Public Transportation  and Environmental Groups in addition to MPOs and various governments.
And one of the Vice-Chairs is Jason Segedy, who is a 30-something and a very progressive leader of the Akron MPO.
Now, of course, the initiative has to deliver!
Thanks for the summation.
I ve been struggling to figure out how to dig into this conversation.
The issue is very complex at least if you consider the entire region rather than just the Cleveland metropolitan area.
As one example, to offer a more positive take on the ease of making new cities – the township I lived in incorporated a few years ago - not because we wanted to be a city, but because townships in Ohio are designed as cities-in-waiting.
We were tired of adjacent cities annexing the rural edges of our township to sprawl into.
The only way to keep the rural areas safe from annexation  and development  is to incorporate so that you can control the zoning and keep them semi-rural.
To some extent, the situation Jim described is me - I live south of Akron, work in Medina, shop in both Summit and Stark counties and attend church  and access medical facilities, and an occasional cultural event  in Cleveland.
For all day weekday events, taking the bus from the Montrose area  west Akron  to Cleveland is almost as fast as, and more convenient than, driving to Cleveland  and the times I ve used it, it has been more than half full  - but I am limited to using it for all day events because there are only a few runs in the morning and a few at night.
I really wish there were options like that I could use for my daily commute across three counties.
You might also be interested in looking at the development of JEDDs  Joint Economic Development Districts   in Coventry township and a few other communities in Summit County in the mid 90s - another very localized way to preserve less developed areas in a township by partnering with the adjacent city to concentrate development in the areas the adjacent the city that was going to annex them anyway.
The model in Coventry  at least at the time it was created  was to collect income taxes in portions of the township  which went to the city , in exchange for the city extending sewer and water at least into the JEDD where development would be concentrated.
I listened to the radio show just now, and enjoyed the conversation.
But the basic argument advanced by Angie - that sprawl is costing the region and the state big $$$ - remains questionable for me.
It seems like this conversation arises from fiscal concerns, but the REASON you re not reading about infrastructure maintenance costs anywhere except CC is because it makes more sense to focus on the bigger ticket items in the budget: health care, education, etc.
But the more interesting and contentious part of the discussion, as it has lately evolved, is whether more intangible costs are being incurred by this sprawl: reclamation of abandoned land, insufficient tax income in the center city.
Everyone on the podcast was willing to vaguely commit to the importance of the  central city  in regional economic health, but there s no agreement at all about how that should be accomplished  are we going to prohibit any further development of farmland in NEO?
Cleveland municipal infrastructure?
And in time-honored Cuyahoga County fashion, no agreement means business as usual.
I sympathize with Angie s desire for a regional land-use plan with teeth: something that local governments can t breach, or at least have to persuade a healthy slice of the region s voters to deviate from.
That would drive more businesses and developers to land that s already been developed and abandoned, which would in turn take a lot of financial stress off government.
And it would drive more residents to housing that s already built  and already on the infrastructure grid  which would give the center city more income tax dollars to work with.
But there is NO WAY that a land use plan stretching across NEO, from Elyria to Youngstown, will ever be drafted and mapped, much less agreed to by the hundreds of governmental bodies affected; it s a large project that would take substantial skilled staff and computer resources, and that sort of thing never gets off the ground in hard economic times.
Plus, I can t find any metro region in the US that s ever done that; the one Angie mentioned on air, Minneapolis, just has an advisory council that tracks land use planning, as far as I can tell, not a top-down land-use plan that s legally enforceable.
Imagine if in the 1970s, when metro Cleveland stopped growing, instead of building dozens of new communities, we used that money to fix the problems that were ailing the region: education, poverty, the environment.
Instead of addressing our problems we ve been building new communities to escape that.
Meanwhile, our social problems have been getting progressively worse.
Want to know what the cost of this is?
What did it cost to expand Richfield over the past decade?
What did it cost to expand Avon?
What have we spent trying to address the market failure we have created in the city?
Billions.
I mean, it s staggering.
You re not going to be able to pinpoint this stuff in the state budget.
It s bigger than that.
In particular I am thinking of the area around Cuyahoga Valley National Park  Semi-Rural places Richfield, Bath, Peninsula, Boston Heights and more suburban communities like Hudson, Brecksville, Valley View, Independence .
I strongly believe that the national park is one of Ohio s greatest assets and that we need to protect, promote and strengthen it at every opportunity.
I also think that the history of these communities is inseparable from the valley and that their future and the park are also inseparable.
George, I am going to try this just one more time.
You aren t going to be able to pinpoint this stuff in the budget because it is too big.
The state -- especially in NE Ohio -- basically has too many cities to for its population.
Too many school districts, too many highway miles, too many sewer lines, too many local governments.
If this were not true, we wouldn t have to tear down entire neighborhoods and schools.
We have an oversupply of these things.
Can you see how that is a massive fiscal problem?
My argument is that a few hundred thousand or even million from education or healthcare isn t really going to change anything.
Ohio will still be headed down the toilet 10 years from now if none of these investments are strategic and sustainable.
Right now in NE Ohio we make massive public investments in infrastructure without regard for how that will effect our environment and our national economic competitiveness.
Ohio s problems are systemic: that s my argument.
As for regional land use planning, George.
It is more nuanced than telling certain communities they can t do any development.
In Minneapolis, they have developed a transportation policy that recognizes the impacts of sprawl.
They do transit oriented development.
They have prioritized transit, backed off highway expansion.
They have found many ways to INCENTIVISE the type of development that is healthy for the region.
In our region, we incentivise unhealthy development: paving greenfields in Richfield and Avon.
NOACA is basically writing a big fat check to landowners in the sticks using the public purse.
If you don t believe me, see how much money the Dolans make off their property by the Avon interchange.
That s how we re investing our money as a region, not improving the Cleveland Public Schools.
I think we should be monitoring this regional planning process.
Pushing for a land use plan with teeth.
The leadership of the project and the leadership at NOACA is important, because there is a changing of the guard going on.
We need progressive people who aren t afraid to challenge the status quo in leadership positions.
From this perspective, I love the choice of Hunter Morrison for the Sustainable Communities process.
Howard Maier, on the other hand, who runs NOACA, has not been a strong enough leader to address these challenges.
He is retiring this year and the NOACA board will select his replacement.
I feel very strongly that these problems cannot be solved by marketing campaigns.
Developers know their business.
They are not going to be fooled by some slick graphic design and spin.
They aren t doing infill development because we haven t incentivised it economically.
We incentivise the opposite.
One way we do that is with free NEW infrastructure.
Then we make OLDER communities responsible for infrastructure maintenance.
A new Brookings study looks at the issue from a different perspective--through the lens of transit agencies and how effective they are at getting people to their jobs.
With the spread of population and the movement of jobs to the suburbs and exurbs, that challenge becomes very difficult for systems built around a central core.
As a semi-recent Texan from Cleveland I’d like to think I know a thing or two about sprawl.
I’m a planner who works Form-based Smart Codes in a largely Euclidean zoned region  not to mention a pro-property rights state  so I hope I can add some perspective to the many points already made.
The idea of containing growth in a reasonable way is somewhat of a sexy idea, right?
It speaks to fiscally responsible infrastructure investments and environmental sensitivity among other fuzzy -feeling concepts.
I see this love-hate relationship on a regular basis with the work I do.
The public will say it hates sprawl until push comes to shove and they end up defending it.
It’s not a pretty process but it does show that there is a place for both systems to coexist.
This is why it would be completely unrealistic to think a peanut butter application of anti-sprawl mechanisms would be possible.
So let’s not assume that the application of one will knock out the other.
There is a really great article, I think by the Congress of New Urbanism, which got to the heart of this matter and one I might post at a later time if I can find it.
Either way I highly suggest checking out CNU.
Whether you’re a fan of the organization or not, they give considerable effort to exploring where anti-sprawl tactics work and where they don’t.
Secondly, I read a lot of really good discussion about specific details  like housing, taxes and policy procedures  which undoubtedly play a role in growth patterns of any community.
To me though, these are concerns that are 20 steps ahead of where the conversation should be.
Instead the conversation should begin with identifying key organizational relationships and the core strengths of each.
Only in THAT discussion will Cleveland be able to match up their “regional wish list” with some tangible structure to begin the tough work ahead.
No offense but I will never understand why Cleveland is stuck under the notion that the starting point for regionalism is taxes or housing or whatever other detailed problem it faces.
Of all things suicidally holy!
There are other options out there.
It just depends on how creative we can be with it.
For instance what if NOACA and the Consortium joined as one entity?
There would be the technical expertise and financial backing that NOACA is known for with the regional representation the Consortium can offer.
Plus, each city that wanted to participate could pay a regular fee and would be able to receive any funding filtered through the NOACA-like arm of the organization.
Its a lovely mix ensuring a regional comprehensive plan AND that municipalities have a carrot to adjust it’s policies and capital improvements to align with a regional vision.
Of course this is just an example.
I’m sure there are many more.
And lastly, I won’t get too much into this, but the conversation thus far largely ignores how private investment influences the public choices we make.
I don’t mean the shady kind of influence.
I’m talking about regular ol’ market influences.
The banking and real estate industries have more standardized measurements influencing their locational decisions than the education system knows what to do with it.
So instead of only attacking the public-private mismatch with policy changes, why not figure out how to leverage the existing capital stack  capital, private investment, and the remaining 25-30-ish% that is so hard to finish with loans these days  with public dollars?
You make very good points.
This is not a public sector problem alone.
No matter what happens with infrastructure investment  we could spend every penny in our central cities  the dynamic of urban sprawl will never change without the private sector and the public at-large desiring  sustainable  development.
High energy prices and dislocation in the real estate market may be catalysts for driving a change in current business model.
Danielle,  concerning the role of private investment,  just look at Columbus.
When planning for the Polaris developments began, the city insisted that  the area be annexed in order to receive city water and sewer services.
I still fail to understand how a city can move beyond the county limits, but they did it.
Columbus is now in Franklin and Delaware Counties.
This is a great conversation each of you is bringing a different perspective to the conversation.
Angie and George you are onto something about simply raising awareness about the issue could lead to the policy change that Angie supports.
1,000 people or 10,000 people make a lot more noise in Columbus then 10 people advocating for policy.
I think the First Suburbs Consortium would be a good partner, if they re willing to make that leap.
Maybe the Fund for our Economic Future, but I m not sure.
The problem is, people living in the  expensive suburbs  are getting a bargain because people who live in the inexpensive places built their roads, extended their electric and sewer lines and helped build their schools.
They have these things at the expense of everyone else.
Also, the good schools argument is tiring to me.
The idea that it s better for kids to grow up in diversity-less, culturally void tax havens is pretty suspect in my opinion.
Yet it s almost unquestioningly accepted here.
This conversation is starting to go in circles.
I d rather not get into whether people living outside the city center are automatically racist, or evading diversity.
That would take this thread way off course, even though I think it s an interesting point.
But I agree with you that center-city people have paid more than their fair share of infrastructure costs, considering that they go out to the suburban malls once in a blue moon, compared to the way larger numbers of commuting shopping trips the outlying suburbanites and exurbanites make.
I thought we were talking about how to change that pattern, and it sounds like there aren t many ways to do it, other than persuade the people who want to build a brand new home in some low-density community to just not do it.
Am I missing something?
Also, Ryan, a lot of people don t agree with me, but I m just not convinced that Cleveland can pull itself up by its bootstraps so to say without real regional investment and cooperation.
I see what you are saying, Ryan and respect your opinion.
I definitely think you are partly right.
I think the cdcs have done an amazing job with the limited resources they have.
But the deck is just so stacked against them.
At first I was kind of excited about the idea of a regional infrastructure bank, but I guess NOACA sort of functions that way.
What I really think we need to do is completely stop expanding our auto-infrastructure.
We just don t need more roads in the region and to the extent that we build them we will just get more sprawl.
I would like to see us focused more on retrofitting our current infrastructure, restriping roads to include bike lanes and even removing highways.
I d be happy if there was some kind of recognition about the consequences of expanding infrastructure in  shrinking  places.
The state s not going to come through but the NE Ohio region should, of course, I don t think they will either.
People in NE Ohio don t recognize how sprawl is hurting them.
Meanwhile, our region is falling farther and farther behind.
My feeling is that the best way to address this would be with a campaign directed at NOACA.
But I realize I am totally on my own on this.
The thing is, right now, NOACA is functioning like a back room, doling out money based on political posturing.
Citizens aren t paying attention.
Money is flowing to exurban and suburban areas disproportionately.
People s commutes are getting longer.
Their taxes are getting higher.
But everyone on NOACA s board just tries their best to  bring home the bacon  for their community.
Hey George, I do want to do something about sprawl, but from where I m sitting, I m just about the only one in the region talking about this.
So I m not going to get ahead of myself and pretend we re living in a political environment where urban growth boundaries are an eminent possibility.
Here s what I would like to see happen.
I would like to see NOACA say, we re done.
We re not expanding infrastructure beyond our developed footprint.
They are going through a planning process right now where they could decide that.
But without some kind of organized political pressure, I cannot imagine they would make this type of decision on their own.
I think NE Ohio need a series of policy reforms.
The most immediate one I advocate is that construction costs for new infrastructure in this shrinking region be borne entirely by the developer.
But that is just me shouting into the wilderness, let s be honest with ourselves here.
I m just a blogger.
I don t have any power.
So I write things.
If someone invites me to develop a land use policy for the region, I d be more than happy to share my insights.
But I m not holding my breath.
NOACA controls millions of dollars in federal infrastructure money.
They are our only regional planning body.
They have very direct control over the way our region is shaped.
More so than any other organization.
I think the best strategy would be to attend a board meeting.
The public is welcome to speak beforehand.
Unfortunately, they are during business hours, and that discourages public involvement.
That is a bad policy and is not a transparent way to operate a government agency, but that is an aside.
In fact, if a few of us went and expressed our concerns, I think it would make a big impact.
I think it would make an even bigger impact if someone from the anti-sprawl camp regularly attended and represented the public on this issue.
We could look at, for example, how much money they are spending on city-serving bike, ped and transit projects as opposed to highway projects which promote sprawl.
We could look at what percentage of their money flows to outer-ring suburbs and how to bring it back into balance.
For example, they never award any money to East Cleveland because East Cleveland really doesn t have the capacity to compete for funds.
That furthers inequality in our region.
Sorry to be so long winded.
I would like to see NOACA, our regional planning agency, develop a regional plan.
And I would like that plan to include a sane and efficient land use and transportation policy.
And I would like to see them stick with it.
This is how  regional planning agencies  are supposed to operate.
That s why the federal government created them.
Right now, they operate more like a jobs shop and an unnecessary middle-man, adding no value to federal programs, IMO  and I used to work there .
This is a good idea, but the current reality is that MPOs have absolutely no authority over land use planning, land use decisions, or land use policy.
We do  and should, I would argue  consider land use issues, because land use decisions can have a marked impact on the transportation system  a new Wal-Mart in, say, Copley Township, being built on a narrow two-lane road ; and vice-versa  a new freeway interchange in, say, Avon, which will spur new development .
But an MPO does not develop a comprehensive land use plan for its region, and does not have any authority  such as veto power  over the development decisions of local communities.
It is not funded by USDOT or ODOT to perform these functions.
This is an interesting point, because there is too little discussion on the macroeconomic effects of urban sprawl, but is it really a budget buster?
Roads and sewers are maintained by all levels of government: the feds maintain the interstates and US highways, the state handles the state routes and the big nature reserves, the cities and townships handle their local roads and sewers, etc.
6B for infrastructure maintenance, out of a ~$57B biennial budget.
6B?
At the municipal level, I get the sense that the outlying communities gladly pay for their infrastructure: part of what entices people to pay higher housing prices  and often taxes  is the separation and seclusion of living in a low-density community.
I thought the budget problems in those communities mostly focused on education costs; if there s sentiment that infrastructure costs are too high, it hasn t reached my ears.
I ve heard differently about Kasich s budget but maybe I was wrong.
Regardless, the cost of infrastructure is enormous.
You also have to add to that cost, the cost of the government basically bailing out Cleveland and some of the failing inner-ring suburbs.
Plus there are enormous social costs that are unpriced, such as poor air quality, time wasted commuting, loss of agricultural land, poor water quality and an increasing gap between the rich and poor.
Ohio cannot afford to keep building new communities every 15 years and throwing the old ones out.
I heard ODOT director Jerry Wray speak in Columbus a few months ago and he said at the rate we re going, we won t have the money to maintain the highway system we ve got, much less expand.
The interesting thing is that is not a Cleveland issue or an Ohio issue, its a national issue, except for a few examples nearly every metropolitan area in the United States is sprawling outward whether they are gaining population or losing them.
In either case, the fragmentation and duplication of services increases the tax burden of residents and is detrimental to the environment.
The right to own property has driven this country s ambitions since the formation of the Union.
Why don t we have a national policy on planning and transportation?
Because land is not a scarce resource, even now fuel isn t scarce either.
So why plan for the adequate distribution of scarce resources when they aren t scarce in the first place?
I personally support the  re-densification  of America and the greater emphasis on public transportation, but the reality is even if we stopped developing new today, we would have to adapt the auto-dependent communities we have built to support higher densities and accommodate public transportation.
I m sorry, the costs of this just go on an on.
Throw in demolition costs in the central city.
School busing, because kids can t walk to school.
The cost of building new schools in the hinterlands and the cost of tearing them down in the city.
It is insane!
Add increased obesity rates and the associated costs, cause remember no one can walk anywhere in these unplanned car-centric suburbs like Avon.
All of this is very expensive and contributes to a lower quality of life for all citizens of Northeast, Ohio.
Furthermore, because of the off-putting decay in our central city, and because of the associated high regional taxes, people don t want to move here and we re hemorrhaging population -- an expensive undertaking in itself.
Every time someone builds a house in Avon, the rest of the housing in this region loses value very slightly, because we have more houses than we need already.
This has been happening for decades so that homeowners in the center have slowly lost all their home equity, contributing to the terrible poverty problem we have here.
I am surprised that maintenance is such a small portion of the budget.
I suspect it s actually much greater.
I remember reading a comparison of US and UK road budgets  unfortunately I can t seem to find it .
Unsurprisingly, the US has more roads per capita, and spends more money on road construction.
Surprisingly, the US spends significantly less per capita on maintenance.
If you followed the news of the bridge collapse in MN, it won t shock you that US roads are considered to be poorly maintained.
When a road is constructed or widened to serve a new exurb, it is generally done with federal or state funds.
This is a subsidy.
Since it is newly constructed, it can avoid major maintenance work, giving the illusion of low cost.
After a few decades, when major repairs have to be made, will taxes go up in the sprawl areas?
Or will the state or federal government again be expected to pay for it?
Federal funding of sewers is particularly nuts.
What better way to ensure that a cost-benefit analysis never enters the equation?
Roads and sewers aren t the only subsidies that these areas receive.
There are many: utility companies are often required to provide service at the same rates in cities and exurbs, even though it requires extensive new construction serving a low density of customers.
This applies to telcos, electricity, gas, even postal service.
A major hidden subsidy is simply the low cost of gas in the US.
Today, gas taxes already fail to cover the costs of the road network.
On top of that, there are environmental costs  from the oil spill in the Gulf to climate change to smog  as well as the military costs of maintaining a steady supply.
Large changes in cities have been made to accommodate exurban growth, from demolishing large swaths of them to make room for freeways, instituting parking minimums to make individual property owners subsidize driving, and reshaping streets to favor the auto over the pedestrian.
It is at best arguable whether this benefits the city or the suburban commuter.
I can see a basis for your list of hidden subsidies, but don t they detract from Angie s original point, that this year s Ohio state budget is spending a lot on sprawl?
If there were federal funding of new sewer construction, how does that hurt the Ohio budget?
Here is a link to the provocative post Angie referenced above.
Portland, Oregon instituted an  Urban Growth Boundary  long ago to combat such a dilemma.
Cities have forgotten their core while annexing outlying border towns.
I wonder if there is a good understanding from residents - in urban, suburban, or exurban areas - of both the cost and the bearers of cost of sprawl.
I seem to hear regular comments about the rights of individual citizens to choose their preferred environment in which to live, but less conversation about specifically how much infrastructure costs to build and to maintain, and how it gets paid for.
Similarly, I regularly hear sentiment expressed that those in outlying areas should not have to pay to support urban areas, but are urban areas actually paying to support outlying areas?
For example, how does water supply work in our region?
Which villages, towns, cities use what water and sewer lines?
If it costs money to maintain these lines, why don t we pay for water based on the distance our home is from the water source?
I think it would be helpful to understand1  costs that rise as a result of sprawl  for example, road maintenance, which presumably has a relationship to the number of miles of highway 2  costs that are unsustainable due to a lack of critical population concentrated in any particular area  schools might fall into this category  and3  how the built environment is paid for  property taxes for the citizens that choose to live there?
State federally funded dollars that come from a pooling of all our taxes?
Does such information exist?
You bring up a very good point of the citizen RIGHT to live where ever we choose.
Which is usually the common argument you here.
People don t live in the city because they don t want to live in the city.
They prefer the suburban lifestyle of strip malls and housing developments named after the trees or farms they replaced.
There needs to be some sort of education about the costs associated with living in suburban exurban communities and the interconnectedness of the region.
We buy cars now that tells us the miles per gallon, amount of CO2 emitted and number of barrels of oil consumed in a year, so why don t we get similar warnings about the environment impact of our home s location and the true cost borne by the community and the region?
Ditto.
I think that argument is basically hogwash.
Since when did anyone in NE Ohio tell anyone they couldn t live somewhere?
The prevailing attitude is,  So you would like to live 50 miles from the city in a completely undeveloped pristine environmental setting?
How can we help?
Build a multi-million dollar highway expansion?
Level every forest between here and Astabula?
Glad you asked.
You make a valid point, the general public is subsidizing the expansion of our region.
Our gas tax dollars are used for roads.
Our fees to water utilities go towards maintaining the new lines, etc.
But communities do have the right and do charge impact fees for the new development.
They charge for things including but not limited to infrastructure costs, parkland and the impact of increased students in the schools, but these fees are minimal when taken in context of the long term impact.
The issue lies at the state level, communities are competing with one another for new residents and commercial activity, and yet this competition is actually created by state law.
Communities cannot share services or revenue, so it creates an every community for themselves scenario.
People have a right to live wherever they want.
My argument is that they don t have a right to have other people pick up the costs for it, especially when the costs are so high.
A friend of mine is nearly 80 and has lived in a rural part of Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh.
She has a well and so doesn t pay for city water, etc.
Suddenly the area she is living is being annexed by the local town and they are doing street improvements and adding a sewer and water line, despite her vote.
She has lived there for decades and now suddenly she is facing a huge financial burden.
Angie, I would love to see data on what makes people move further and further away from the urban core.
School systems are a frequent answer but there has to be more.
For example, do people just not like living close anymore?
Is it housing stock?
I always wonder how long Beachwood will be able to maintain itself with decidedly 70 s style housing.
Is it the chicken and the egg?
Do people move further out because the road was built to carry them further out?
Are people just not working downtown anymore; therefore, commute time is not a problem.
I know some people just dislike old houses.
Is that a major factor?
Is it retail development?
As an eastside suburbanite, I  need  to go downtown rarely.
It would be good to get data points on people s motivations.
Meisha, our political system rewards people for moving farther away.
Take Avon for example.
Apart from its proximity to the lake, everything that makes Avon a desirable place to live is a political construct: Good schools, property taxes, relative economic and racial homogeneity.
We have developed a school funding system that arbitrarily favors Avon and punishes Cleveland, that motivates people to move further away.
Our system of small, fragmented municipal governance segregates people by race and income.
Furthermore, Avon residents are exploiting loopholes in the tax code to lower their tax burden.
They benefit from state, federal and regional subsidies for infrastructure but by en large do not help defray the costs of regional concerns like poverty and cultural assets.
Avon residents are acting in their economic best interests when they move away.
But it is also difficult for them because they have high transportation costs and little or no cultural amenities.
Given the choice, I lot of people have made the decision, based on economics, to move to Avon.
But in this system, everyone makes sacrifices and everyone s well being is diminished.
Look at Cleveland Heights, where the city actually tells residents how many children they may have based on their house.

Lynne Banki is the founder of Autism Day  Washington.
Her son Caspian, then about 4 years old, had  social and verbal skills well behind children his age – telltale signs of  autism.
Lynne had met other parents of autistic children in Colorado, but was  suddenly on her own in a new state without much of anyone who could relate to  the daily struggles of the parent of an autistic child.
It was that isolation that drove Banki to start  Autism Day.
Now in its 12th year, the free event is something of an annual  pilgrimage for autistic children and their families from around the Pacific  Northwest.
Located on Jubilee Farm in Carnation, the event  features hayrides, games and a slip-and-slide for children, as well as more  than 70 vendor booths.
The event has morphed from a gathering of 40 to more  than 600.
Banki said the event serves as a clearing house  for the services autistic children and their families end up needing.
Schools  and tutoring companies that specialize in helping autistic learners have  information about their services, and artists offer hands-on projects for  children.
Banki said the event is above all a place where  parents can let their guard down and meet others who are going through the  experience of being the parent of an autistic child.
Cyn has been a volunteer for YEARS!
She has  volunteered in both kids  classrooms and schools through the years doing  whatever was needed or she signed up for.
As a resident and volunteer in our community,  she inspires others.
I know very few people who can accomplish as much  as Nicky.
She has a very full life yet I have never had her fail me when I needed  help.
She seems to know how to stretch time.
She is efficient and pleasant and  always soltuion oriented.
She is involved in so many projects with the  Sammamish Kiwanis that I couldn t begin to name them all.
Although her  allegiance is strong with Kiwanis her focus is always on serving our community  especially youth and Kiwanis offers a good vehicle for her to do that but not  her only vehicle.
Every year she helps with the African Bike Drive and our  Harvest Festival.
She works extra shifts when someone doesn t show up for the  city s month long food drive.
She is constantly in service to our community.
Nicky should be recognized for this category for  quality of service and magnitude of her service to our community, especially  her support of youth organizations.
I witnessed her community dedication in 1998,  when she joined the Sammamish Kiwanis Club.
Nicky is unique in that she is able  to join in with her peers or lead a community project  she is normally first to  arrive and last to leave  Nicky is a true leader, full of ideas with the  ability to make her projects come true.
Result: Many Sammamish families enjoying outdoor  time because they can afford ski equipment.
Boys & Girls Club Dance - Result: quality  activity for our local youth.
All profits go back to B&G Club.
Result: In 2012 Sammamish Kiwanis gave a grant  over $5,000 to B&G.
This grant was difficult to secure several Clubs were  competing for it.
Nicky would not give up.
In addition to these programs Nicky has a  passion for recycling.
She has participated in recycling education for youth.
Jane Dulski has been serving Sammamish as a volunteer,  friend and all around good samaritan since she moved to Sammamish with her  family in 2000.
She stays involved as their guest  speaker for Western WA.
She has been involved in the PTSA since her  children started school at McAuliffe Elementary in 2002.
She held many board  and committee positions, devoting hours to the school.
From 2008-2010 she  served as co- President and won the prestigious PTA Golden Acorn award.
Still keeping involved at the school level, Jane  took additional positions with the LWSD District PTSA.
This year, she is  co-President of the Lake Washington District PTSA.
Her oldest son is on the verge of becoming an  Eagle Scout with his two younger brothers close behind.
This is in great part  due to Jane’s involvement with their scouting troop.
If you were stranded in the middle of the  woods, having Jane by your side would ensure your survival.
In 2011, Jane took on three-year term as  Community Advisor to Evergreen Hospital representing Sammamish providing input  on health care issues to Evergreen and its Board of Commissioners.
Susan joined the board of directors of the local  non-profit, International Smile Power in 1998 to do work that connects students  in local public and at-risk schools with children in need around the world.
Susan also works as a  volunteer art teacher and Community Outreach Facilitator at Echo Glen Detention  Center.
Children in our community learn from Susan that their compassion for  other children in need can make a difference around the world.
She empowers  local youth to affect change, and is helping to create the next generation of  volunteers and humanitarians.
Susan also has created an army of local adult  volunteers who now provide service in schools, tent cities and at Echo Glen.
Middle School , but one has to think about the role she has  played in the lives of 1,500-2,000 students over her years of service  I think  over 15 years – would need to be confirmed  at Inglewood.
Friday night!
Mahbubul has shown an amazing belief in giving  back through volunteer activism.
I have always focused on building my  professional and personal life around improving communities.
On reporting this, a fan of his, former City Council Member Mark Cross,  replied:   Oh, he is a rock star.  Mahbubul recently reupped as a Planning Commissioner for the City of Sammamish.
If that were not enough, wanting to learn about housing needs, he joined  the Citizen s Advisory Board for A Regional Coalition for Housing  ARCH , which  advises the City of Sammamish and other Eastside cities and King Co.
He truly exemplifies the  Circle of Service.
I ve witnessed Tom s involvement in several  community organizations over the past 15 years.
Tom s enthusiastic and  charismatic engagement with the Boy Scouts mentored numerous youth to  Do  Their Best  while enticing several adults to also volunteer their time and  talent.
Through Tom s service as Cubmaster, Scoutmaster and high adventure  events leader, his passionate commitment to our youth was evident well our  troop.
He now contributes the same energy to the Girl Scout programs with his  daughters.
Tom has also enthusiastically volunteered his time as a chaperone to  our school programs, as coach and mentor in his Martial Arts programs and as in  an active role in his faith community.
The energy that Tom contributes to our  community is contagious, inspiring me and several others to join him in serving  the youth in our community.
I am quite certain that she is involved with many more projects and  organizations than these, but the 2 mentioned certainly make her worthy of  being recognized.
Daphne s creative leadership, passion for  community and the arts has inspired the Sammamish Arts Commission from its  inception ten years ago to the active, integal and enriching Sammamish cultural  development program that it is today.
Daphne was appointed by city council to  lead the original arts task force from 2001 to develop cultural programs for  the arts within the Sammamish community to include an annual arts  fair,  cultural programs such as theatre readings, poetry events and arts for seniors.
Daphne s leadership has demonstrated fiscal responsibility to work  within a budget; her creative grant submissions have rewarded the city and the  commission; and, her focused dedication has developed an active, enriching and  growing arts commission sensitive to the needs and changing demongraphics of  Sammamish.
Daphne s innate passion for the arts and commitment to community  serve as examples for others to aspire.
Sally supports a model called Servant Leadership.
I believe that Sally Rusk has all the  qualities that one would hope to see in a SAMMI nominee.
She has been the  Activities Coordinator at Inglewood Middle School for the last 4 years.
She understands this philosophy because she s  spent many hours studying it, attending conferences on her own time and dime  and reading and reflecting on it.
She truly is a servant leader in our school  and teaches the kids to be the same.
She is constantly looking for activities, exercises and campaigns  that take leadership to the bottom of our school and pyramid it up in a way  that involves, includes, educates and inspires.
Lunch Time Supervision.
This is not part of  Sally s job.
It is actually her planning period.
A planning period is a  genuinely prized hour of an educator s day where they can organize, grade,  plan, etc.
On most days Sally chooses to spend that time in the lunch room.
She  seeks to interact with all of our students.
Sally knows that when kids love to come to school  that she is strengthening protective factors that will bond students to school.
Children who love school and are attached to that school are more likely to  graduate, less likely to engage in harmful activities and less likely to choose  to be involved in alcohol and other drugs.
Lock Ins.
Sally is the first coordinator who  has taken on this quest.
These evenings are completely volunteer hours.
Her students lead  activities, provide tours and are generally welcomed by her new leadership  students.
We ve seen firsthand how much a difference that makes to a new child who  is looking at a transfer to a new school as a very scary thing.
Summer Trainings and Institutes: Sally  spends three days in the summer taking her officers on a retreat.
She teams up  with other leadership students and directors from the west side of the state.
The hours spent on this retreat also reflects unpaid time.
She knows however,  that these events do indeed motivate her students.
When they see a young adult  willingly and joyfully engaging in the work that happens at these events, she  buys their trust and loyalty.
Dances.
Every activities coordinator plans  dances; it s a given.
Sally takes it to a new level.
Prior to the dance she  brainstorms themes with her students.
Last year I saw her plan  with their leadership officers and then schedule time for shopping.
The kids   parents carpooled and brought them to shopping areas to meet Sally and help  pick out fun and colorful decorations.
These outings often occurred Saturday  mornings!
Student Workshops.
Last year Sally organized  the first ever off site leadership workshop.
I predict that Sally will be  leading such workshops in the future.
She  has helped them to do teacher appreciation work that goes above and beyond  again.
Middle School last year.
That meant that last spring we had  two classes leaving and two new classes coming in.
That was a tremendous amount  of work for all of us.
Sally, however, saw it as an opportunity.
She personally  worked with our principal to invite every elementary school to come to  Inglewood for an afternoon.
She planned the activities; she welcomed and emceed  the events.
It was exhausting but she did it with a smile.
She also spent two long nights away from her  family as she organized and coordinated the 8th and 9th grade send offs.
She  does all of it with a smile and loves it.
That is a miracle in itself!
Sally is  one of a kind.
I hope this helps you  to see that she is way more than a staff person.
Her passion in Inglewood  Middle School and she makes a true difference.
Consequently, youth have  opportunities to fail, programs are not as polished as the adults would like,  but leaders emerge!
Through years of service, Bruce Salmon has  mentored and inspired many to follow his example.
I would like to nominate Dave Sanford for the  CIRCLE OF SERVICE AWARD.
He has been a long time friend, as well as an  outstanding dedicated community volunteer.
Dave has been a constant volunteer for his  Bellevue church for well over 30 years.
He has helped them, with building,  repairing, volunteering and doing whatever they need done.
He has always been  ready to commit his time.
He has  been a Sammamish Kiwanis member for about three years and is a very active  member doing most of the community service activities we have had during his  tenure with our club.
He has been willing to do what needs to be done for the  club and the community.
He has always stepped up to the plate when we needed  someone to help out.
This group helps  seniors in need of repairs on their homes or yards.
I know he has personally  helped repair, stain decks and clean up yards for seniors who cannot afford to  pay for this work.
He also arranged for Habitat for Humanity to help one senior  lady with repairs on her home.
Dave has  been a regular Habitat for Humanity volunteer for years and has organized work  days for our Kiwanis group to help Habitat as well.
He has continued to be a  steady asset for Habitat and goes to help whenever he can.
His latest  volunteer venture was to be trained by the American Red Cross and go cross  country to the East Coast for a week, where he helped feed people who needed  help after hurricane Sandy.
This shows his far reaching volunteer activity, I  am sure he will do this again in the future.
Dave has been a true friend and a great help to  me personally.
I am a widow and he has put a new roof on my shed, and fixed a  broken door lock on my garage.
He has cut off my rotting overhang and has  offered to paint my house for me in the future for just the cost of the paint.
I could not ask for a more caring friend.
Finally, he and his wife Beth were there for me  at a very emotional time.
They came over, late in the night, to keep me company  the night my husband died, until my son could arrive at my house.
I knew I  could call them and they would be there for me when I needed them.
I really  appreciate their friendship they are both so caring.
I would like to nominate Dave because he is one  of the most giving, committed volunteers I know and he is very deserving of a  SAMMI.
I know he will continue  to volunteer for the rest of his life and he is truly an inspiration to us all.
Mr.
Shedd for the last 6 years has been active in  Citizens for Sammamish in leading the finance sub group, working to analyze  city budgets.
He is now the leader  of CFS and this year has hosted meetings on diverse topics of interest in the  city.
Mr.
He  is positive, tireless and committed to achieving a better city and city  government for all citizens in our great city.
Since receiving the Spirit of Sammamish Award Mary has started a new  event by being the catalyst for the Mayor s Month of Concern for the Hungry.
She also has a  constant supply of food and is often called upon whenever there is an emergency  need in Sammamish  which happens more often than most of us realize .
Mary also sends  out a weekly or as needed call for volunteers becoming the go to source in  Sammamish when organizations need volunteers.
This organization and their  team of volunteers deserves ongoing support.
Steve has helped with getting an AM radio station  for the city in case of emergencies and was on the technical advisory  committee.
He is the Emergency Coordinator for the local amateur radio  community  SARGE  leading them in emergency preparedness.
He was recently  elected as director of Western Washington Amateur Relay Association  WWARA .
He  is a member of the Eastside Fire & Rescue Service Support Volunteers.
He is  also a member of the Sammamish Citizen Corps Council.
He is constantly volunteering  at numerous functions within Sammamish:   Concerts in the Park, Sammamish s Fourth of July celebration, Nightmare  at Beaver Lake and Sammamish Nights celebration.
Steve is one of the primary  volunteers within my organization, the ARAS Foundation.
Yearly he helps us with  the Harvest Festival where we assist families in need.
Also every year he helps  us with our Bikes for Africa Drive by collecting bicycles and doing repair work  to prepare the bikes for shipment to Africa.
He also volunteers for many of our  smaller projects throughout the year too.
Steve is intelligent and very  perceptive but never pushes his view point on to someone else.
He is a good  listener and always accesses a situation methodically before taking action.
He  has helped our organization on so many occasions that I couldn t begin to  recall them all.
He will do anything that is asked of him with an open heart and  willingness to do a good job.
Zoe embodies love and giving through her work as  a Puppy Raiser for Canine Companions for Independence.
As a puppy raiser, it is  her job to take the puppy to dog class every week, socialize the puppy in all  kinds of settings and work on 30 plus commands.
After having the puppy for 16 months,   from cute little butterball to full grown trained dog , Zoe then turns the  puppy over to CCI for further advanced training in California, knowing she will  not see the puppy again.
It is heart breaking to watch as Zoe turns over this  very well trained, very loved dog over to an organization that provides service  dogs to those in need.
Zoe is selfless in her love, care and time she commits  to raising these puppies that will one day become a service dog.
In the end, it is worth all  the tears at goodbye knowing how much these dogs change people’s lives.
Dave is always taking on the difficult project.
Dave has involved  related resources for funding, done the work himself, or supervised the team he  organized to get it done.
He has the Courage to stay with the project.
An example - When Kiwanis  Dave is a member  and  Rotary investigated the possibility of partnering in a non-profit group to  service Sammamish, Dave jumped right in.
Dave worked with CJ Kahler of Rotary,  Eastside Friends of Seniors and Habitat for Humanity to create Sammamish Cares.
Sammamish Cares has completed many projects  locally, but most noteworthy is the work they did for an older couple.
They had  few resources to make large repairs on their home.
The man’s health was very  poor.
Dave took this on, and like all his volunteer efforts, combined with  Rotary, ES Friends of Seniors and Habitat this couple have a safe home  including ADA upgrades.
Dave volunteers for many, many service  organizations.
He is very active with Habitat for Humanity.
Dave participates  on a weekly basis for HfH when a project warrants it.
He has been assigned to  oversee projects on very large builds.
Dave also fundraises for Habitat.
After completing certification as a Red Cross  Disaster Relief volunteer, Dave was recently deployed to the east coast to help  with the Sandy victims.
Sally is a long time  Sammamish resident who is an active volunteer in all facets of the community.
Sally  organizes giving to the YWCA family village.
She collects items from the  neighborhood to stock and decorate an apartment at the Y as well as school  supplies and Holiday baskets for children and families.
Sally also volunteers  regularly at Working Wardrobe to support those trying to get a job.
Sally is  active in supporting our military and collects items and gift certificates for  care packages to be assembled for our service men and women.
Sally is active in  her church and supports many causes there.
Sally is an active member of our  neighborhood, actively participating and volunteering at every opportunity.
I  know Sally also takes an active roll in the political process and encourages  others to do so.
I am sure there are many more  areas that Sally volunteers in that I am not aware of, because Sally doesn t  talk about her work much, she just does it with a giving spirit and expects  nothing in return.
Sally is a wonderful person, neighbor and friend.
Sally  deserves to be recognized for her volunteer work and community spirit.
Sarah is worthy of a SAMMI  award for her dedication to making those with disabilities feel included with  unconditional acceptance, compassion, respect, and dignity.
Sarah was recently named peer  tutor of the month at Eastside Catholic High School even though she was only in  her second month as a peer tutor.
As a peer tutor Sarah has not only assisted  students with disabilities with their class work, but has expanded their social  circles by introducing them to her friends and including them in  extracurricular school activities.
Thanks to Sarah, these students have many  new friends.
And they are truly friends, just like Sarah.
Sarah extends her dedication  to include those with disabilities far beyond EC.
She is currently the youth  leader for her 4-H club and has mentored a member with autism for the past few  years, enabling that member to participate and feel included in all of the  club’s activities.
Sarah also volunteers with a sports camp for special needs  kids each summer and has volunteered as a “buddy” for younger children with  autism through the Families For Effective Autism Treatment organization.
She  has also partnered with community members with disabilities to make it possible  for them to volunteer at the food bank.
But most of all, Sarah  doesn’t think of the time she spends with people with special needs as “volunteer hours”.
She thinks of it as spending time with her friends.
And  Sarah has a lot of happy friends, with a lot of very grateful parents.
He is an inspiration  to all of us.
His  participation and contribution to the community affects not only the attendees  of all of these events but serves as inspiration to all.
He has  served on the Sammamish Parks Commission for a number of years and has been  recognized as an outstanding volunteer at the YMCA.
Larry is a big promoter of  city events especially the Farmers Market and volunteers countless hours  helping at city events.
The Farmers Market is most important to Larry because  it involves people having access to natural healthy food and is eco-friendly.
Larry may well be involved in other community  activities that I don t know about because he is such a  gadfly  community builder.
It didn’t matter how big or small the job—he was always your man to get  it done!
I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with him and to call him  a friend!
Someone needs to be able to count all the  people that attend these events.
Larry was involved in trying to put together a  Sustainable Sammamish committee, he is also involved with the Community Garden  Steering Committee.
Larry is an incredible asset to our community  and I would be delighted to see him honored at the SAMMI Awards.
May Gross and Karin House s  dedication to the Eastside Catholic School community is seemingly endless.
Both  of these parents are dedicated to supporting our school community through  coordinating hospitality events to benefit current parents, faculty and staff,  as well as prospective families.
They have also coordinated the marketing of  event-related procurement drives as well as supported numerous middle school  and high school-related events such as uniform sales and student socials.
What  makes May and Karin special is their thorough ownership of the projects they  commit themselves to as well as their attention to the finest details of their  tasks.
May s creativity and time results in expertly-detailed meals and  confections which convey both her team s great care and support for those they  serve as well as the importance of the message they are associated with.
Karin s excellent attention to detail and work ethic keep processes moving  forward on time with tasks completed thoroughly.
During one week you might find  May and Karin working in the kitchen during a hospitality event and the next  week you might find them out in the parking lot during carpool times handing  out handmade treats to parents and students as a way of marketing an upcoming  event.
No task is too small or too great for this dynamic team of parent  volunteers.
May and Karin exemplify servant leadership, one of Eastside  Catholic School s three touchstones, by being true leaders who positively  influence others through their example.
He has made himself available to  drive our clients to Dr.
Nolen has become indispensable to our  organization.
He willing  rolls up his  sleeves and cheerfully does whatever needs to be done.
I wish  I could clone him!
First, Jill helps out with CERT Community  Emergency Response Team  & has passes along a bountiful of information to  other groups she participates in here Sammamish to help us out with emergency  readiness.
She is also the art docent  for her son Jack s class.
I have seen her crafting abilities first  hand, and she s making a fabulous art docent for the betterment of kids in  Sammamish!
She ll likely be heavily involved on Art Walk day too.
She has also  helped to facilitate 2 of the 4 MOMS groups that are another group of women s  groups at Mar, Queen of Peace church.
While this may all be time  feasible for a stay at home mom, Jill is not only a wonderful mother to her son  Jack, but she also works as a part-time nurse in oncology.
Bob has spent his entire life  taking care of others.
He loves being in service whether it is in a leadership  role or being supportive of someone else in charge.
Although one of his  professions is being a personal coach, he never turns anyone away if they are  unable to pay and goes beyond the call of duty to make certain they have the  tools necessary to be on a path of joy in their lives.
He spends countless  hours helping with projects within our non profit ARAS Foundation such as the  African Bike Drive and Harvest Festival as well as assisting other  organizations.
No job is too big or too little for him and he always brings the  very best of himself.
Tom has a true passion for the  sport of baseball, and a passion to develop boys to play and appreciate the  game.
It is fitting that he be  recognized for promoting community spirit through his volunteerism and promotion  of the All American Sport!
Thanks to Marla for  the MANY hours she has given pro bono to help honor the volunteers and  community of Sammamish.
This program gives children an opportunity to  foster personal growth while learning public speaking and leadership skills.
It is a project fostered under  the umbrella of Toastmasters of Sammamish.
Aside from youth leadership David has recently founded  the TRIO Northwest Chapter  Transplant Recipient International Organization   which is an advocacy group for those seeking organ transplants.
The territory for this chapter encompasses from southern Alaska  to Hawaii to Idaho and Oregon.
I hope Kira will be recognized for the  butterfly  she has become and the inspiration of courage, in spite  of circumstance, she is to our community.
Jenean got her notary certification so that  she could collect signatures from neighbors in support of keeping her business!
She has fought this disease  with grace and courage, even participating in the Susan G.
She truly exemplifies courage in our  community!
Jenean came to our board  meeting today at Inglewood.
Gave a quick update on herself – quite moving  actually – and ran the meeting with her Co-President.
We were all truly grateful and inspired to  have our president back at the helm.
She does not sit at home waiting for  something to happen, but is out volunteering in her kids  classrooms, PTSA  events, school events, Cancer walks, working in the healthroom at school, choir  events,  and making a difference to  others.
Jenean has been involved in  PTA at multiple levels.
She began working in PTA at Margaret Mead Elementary 10  years ago.
She never stopped, she chaired vision and hearing, health room,  helped in the classroom, joined the board and has been President at both Mead  and Inglewood.
She spent most of her day at the elementary school.
Some people  thought she was a staff.
She has also served on the Lake Washington PTSA  Council as an Area VP mentoring other local PTA s.
She also served as the 2nd  VP helping with the annual Lake Washington PTSA basket auction.
Jenean has been  a friendly face to all children in our local schools and she never said no to  any volunteer opportunity that came her direction.
Recently she had to step  away to focus on her health challenges and her family.
We nominate our departed  friend, Pam Austin, for a posthumous SAMMI in the Community Spirit category.
During her life, Pam gave heart and soul to her community, and we are all  enriched as a result.
Although disabled with  chronic illness, Pam considered it her purpose to participate in civic duties,  and to involve others with her.
She was President of the Demery Hill Homeowners  Association, and she was founder of the Issues in American Democracy Discussion  Group.
Her ethos held that people must learn civics in daily life, and she  brought this message to everyone who knew her.
She would spend hours preparing  lavish food for guests to enjoy, whether it was for the annual 4th of July  Picnic and Bike Parade, or as refreshments after the Discussion Group.
She was  an activist in local politics, working on various committees for her political  party.
She remained, to the end, inclusive and bi-partisan, even to often find  fault with her own party.
She connected humanely with friends and others of  differing political views.
Pam had courage.
Although  suffering physical pain, she also had the courage of her convictions.
Those who  knew Pam were changed forever as a result, and she served our community with a  call to action to get involved and to make a difference.
Honoring her memory  with a SAMMI will carry forward her message of civic responsibility.
Adithti is an involved,  dedicated and compassionate person who has integrated service to her community  into her life by enhancing the lives of children.
Recently, Adithti  single-handedly raised over 2700 dollars for Compassion International, an  organization that allows families to financially sponsor children in need and  develop a relationship with the children and their families.
To do so, Adithti  performed a solo Bharatnatyam  Indian Classical Dance  Recital, a talent and  passion she has developed for over 10 years.
Adithti attributes all her  actions to her passion for empowering her generation to become engaged,  well-rounded, and productive future citizens.
She is a natural teacher and  works as a skilled and motivated Bharatnatyam instructor for her dance school  based in Sammamish.
There, she helps students develop dance skills and teaches  them how hard work and discipline can positively impact their futures.
She also  teaches beginning piano students at home so that children can have lifelong  musical skills and appreciation for music.
Adithti also works in the Kids Club  at Pine Lake Athletic club to show kids how to stay healthy and active from a  young age.
She has recognized the value  of service and strives to give back to her local and global communities.
Adithti is an active member of Key Club at Skyline High, an International  Bacchalaureate candidate, and is recognized for her service by her peers,  instructors, and community members.
Adithti aspires to open her own dance  academy to provide free access to Indian dance in her community.
Lauren Christian is a  remarkable young adult who continues to contribute her volunteer support at  Eastside Baby Corner!
During the summer, she spent a great deal of time  developing and implementing a vastly improved new system for inventory control  at our hub.
Her creative new system has greatly improved our efficiency AND we  have much better control over our clothing inventory.
Her creative solution allows  us to distribute more pieces of clothing when available and it allows us to  more quickly train new volunteers on our sorting protocol.
She has also  recruited her Girl Scout troop to volunteer here and we are always grateful for  the opportunity to share our mission with new volunteers.
Lauren is reaching  out to explore new volunteer opportunities but she also continues to volunteer  at Eastside Baby Corner.
Thank you for the opportunity to recognize one of the  important people who help us reach children in need!
I was introduced to Tinuola  by her mom Arinola.
They are originally from Nigera and expressed interest in  our African Bike Drive.
Tinuola recognized the value of bikes in Africa.
She decided  to conduct a drive of her own, recruited volunteers and collected dozens of  bikes.
She even arranged to have them delivered to our cargo container.
She  also held a fundraiser for our Harvest Festival Toy Drive and collected $400.
She purchased the toys and delivered them to me.
She spent hours helping with  the city s month long food drive by passing out flyers at grocery stores as  well as sorting food at the storage unit.
She has great follow through and can  be relied on to complete a project beyond expectation.
She is pleasant and  bright and a natural born leader.
Prabha Dublish embodies the  Youth Spirit category of a youngster who shows passion for helping others by  volunteering in our community and setting a positive example.
She has always  been a willing participant in local non profits as a young volunteer, but has  really hit her stride this year as a Girl Scout working on her Gold Award.
The  focus of the organization will be on service to local organizations.
The list  of non profits that she has contacted includes the Sammamish Rotary, Eastside  Friends of Seniors, ARAS Foundation and Eastside Baby Corner.
Charity Circle  meets every third Thursday at City Hall.
As a member of the Rotary  Club of Sammamish Community Service Committee I had the pleasure of meeting  with Prabha and hearing about her plans for the Charity Circle.
She really  impressed me as an organized and energetic person who is highly motivated by a  sincere drive to serve her community.
Part of her motivation for starting  Charity Circle is to provide an activity that brings students together from all  three high schools through a common purpose.
The students will enjoy making new  friends while providing needed services to local nonprofits.
Prabha’s  enthusiasm is infectious and I’m sure the Charity Circle will become a popular  activity for local teens who wish to serve.
I would like to nominate  Prabha Dublish for the 2012 SAMMI Award for her passionate desire to involve  the youth in the community to give back while meeting and working with new  people with mutual interests.
Charity Circle, a non-profit organization Prabha founded  in September of 2012, reflects that desire.
Charity Circle provides a  much-needed voice for Sammamish teenagers, encouraging the youth to take a  larger stride to develop themselves and shape the world around them.
Its 38  members have partnered with Birthday Dreams -- An non-profit organization  dedicated to providing birthday parties to homeless children and foster  children living in group homes  -- and raised 73 gifts for their cause;  Prabha and Charity Circle have also partnered with Operation Bald Eagle -- a  non-profit organization that helps serve the people who served our nation --  and wrote 20 letters expressing Charity Circle s gratitude to troops fighting  in Afghanistan.
Prabha also co-founded a club  at Skyline High School in January: Shock Club, which is also dedicated to  getting students involved in change and to give back to the community.
So far,  Shock Club has raised $350 for Echo Glen Children s Center.
This school year,  Shock Club is running a drive with the non-profit Generation Joy to raise  supplies and money so that children in Southern Africa can go to school and  have a better education, getting more people involved in the global community.
With support, Prabha hopes to  inspire more teenagers around the world to contribute back to the community.
I would like to nominate  Prabha Dublish for the 2012 SAMMI Award for her active and passionate  involvement in the community.
Charity Circle is a  non-profit community organization which encourages the youth to participate in  developing the community for its general welfare through volunteer service.
So  far since its establishment in September of this year, Charity Circle has  raised around 75 presents to give to a non-profit organization called “Birthday  Dreams” which will provide these presents to homeless and foster children on  their birthdays.
Prabha is also involved in  the community through Skyline High School, where she helped start Shock Club,  also focused on involving more students in the community.
It is partnering with  Generation Joy to help raise school materials for the needy children in Southern  Africa.
Not only is Prabha inspiring  the youth in Sammamish, but she is creating a global impact which touches many  people she has never, and probably will never meet.
Thank you for considering my  nomination for Prabha Dublish.
I am voting for Prabha  Dublish for the 2012 SAMMI Award for her passion in “youth spirit”.
She is very  involved in the Skyline High School and the Sammamish community, particularly  in encouraging the youth in the community to participate in community building  and service projects.
One of her major concerns is to concentrate on teens  physically volunteering, rather than just collecting donations, so you can see  the impact of your service.
With this in mind, Prabha  started a non-profit organization called Charity Circle in 2012 September,  which she has been planning since June.
Charity Circle voices Prabha’s dream to  expand the meaning and the idea of community service among her peers in the  local community.
Charity Circle has partnered with Birthday Dreams to collect  Birthday gifts to foster children, and they have also partnered with Operation  Bald Eagle to write letters of gratitude to thank our troops fighting in  Afghanistan.
Prabha also helped found  Shock Club in Skyline High School, which this year is focusing on collecting  food, money, and supplies to send to children in Southern Africa who are less  fortunate and cannot afford education.
Prabha’s unique and  creativity in tackling the issue of global community awareness and volunteering  of the youth makes me choose her as the 2012 SAMMI Award nominee.
Prabha defines “youth  service” because she is a committed member of the community, as she volunteers  with passion and selflessly and motivates the youth of Sammamish to do the  same.
The main way she is inspiring the youth to contribute to the community is  through a non-profit organization she founded this September called “Charity  Circle”, which encourages the youth to create a larger societal impact.
Prabha also started up a club  in Skyline High School called Shock Club, which has a similar concept.
Shock  Club is creating a global reach this year by helping run a money and supply  drive for children in Africa to aid their educational purposes.
It is also  creating a community impact by raising money for Echo Glen’s Children’s Center.
Charity Circle also partnered  with another non-profit  Birthday Dreams , which whom they collected 75 gifts,  which Birthday Dreams will give to foster and homeless children on their  birthdays.
Prabha Dublish serves as a  very inspiring individual among her peers at Skyline High School, and as  someone the city of Sammamish can look up to, especially teenagers.
She hopes  encourage more and more teens in the community and in the world rise up as  individuals to give to something larger.
Kaylee Hansen is now in her second year as Event Chair for this event.
Kaylee s leadership and  dedication with Relay for Life has been above and beyond any professional staff  could dream of having from a volunteer.
While spending 10-15 hour a  week volunteering for Relay, Kaylee is also involved with the Sammamish Teen  Center, EHS Honor Society and works locally at a daycare.
Kaylee is a leader,  role model and has played a very critical role in the Sammamish community these  past few years.
She has also been involved with our Parent’s Night Outs.
Kaylee has also been involved with  an Earth Day Stream Restoration Project, Middle School Dance, World Wide Day of  Play and she was a part of a group who met with MBA students from the  University of Washington.
They will be involved in a King County Teen  Summit, hosting another Family Movie Night, Parent’s Night Out, as well as  being involved in our Holiday Helper Program.
Teddy has served for three  consecutive years on the Sammamish Youth Board.
Overall  Teddy is a mature young adult who does not hesitate to give of himself and  always has the greater good in mind.
I think Arjun Kumar is a  wonderful example of what can be accomplished by a organized and hard working  young man!
He volunteers throughout the community and we are always delighted  to see him name on the Eastside Baby Corner volunteer roster.
Arjun is an  especially valuable volunteer because he is willing to take the initiative and  move forward when he sees a task that needs to be done - he doesn t wait to be  asked - he takes action!
He volunteers here on a regular basis and he is now  recruiting from his vast network of friends and contacts to encourage new  people to join us!
His support is appreciated!
Amanda Levenson has been  volunteering at Eastside Baby Corner for the past couple of years and her level  of involvement has steadily increased!
She is a very productive worker and she  has shared her organizational and artistic talents with us in a number of ways.
This year, she designed and created a Pants Party poster to help us promote our  annual Pants Party event in the community.
She also volunteered to support this  important event by contributing her time as our Pants Party intern.
She helped  recruit volunteers, in kind sponsors and gift certificates and our event was a  great success!
In addition to helping with this event, she volunteers here on a  regular basis and she is always willing to jump in and help with a broad  variety of tasks.
Eastside Baby Corner relies of the support of more than 1,500  volunteer hours every month to help us reach 500 children on a weekly basis.
Amanda s cheerful support is infectious and inspiring!
I am pleased  to submit my support for the SAMMI Nomination of Jerome Siangco in the Youth  Spirit Category.
As Co-chair  of the Rotary Sammamish Concert in the Parks; I have had the pleasure of Jerome  attending and working the Rotary Booth and our Nightmare at Beaver Lake booth  during each week of the Concert series.
He was a youth leader, motivator and  exemplary in the support for the concert activities each week.
Jerome also was  a leader of the High School Interact club, Nightmare at Beaver Lake, the  Challenge Day race and many other activities.
I highly support Jerome’s  nomination.
I hereby  respectfully nominate Jerome Siangco for the SAMMI Awards Foundation YOUTH  SPIRIT award.
First  becoming aware of Jerome in early 2012 as a founding member of the Sammamish  Rotary Interact club within Eastside Catholic High School, I found out from Bob  Sprung, Eastside Catholic’s college counselor, that Jerome almost  single-handedly, and overnight, recruited a core group of students large enough  to found the club.
Today, the club stands at close to 40 members, largely due  to Jerome’s energy, drive and enthusiasm for community service.
Later, I  observed him helping us at the Summer Concerts at the Park helping at the  Rotary food concession raising money for local charities.
Often arriving early  for set-up and only leaving after close as we packed up for the eve.
I believe  he helped out each and every Thursday during the concert series.
Seeing his  enthusiasm is infectious, and he is a pleasure to have around.
Lastly, as  Deputy Chair, Nightmare at Beaver Lake, I found him volunteering at our “Facebook Booth” encouraging our Nightmare attendees to have their pictures  taken and helping to promote our charity event widely across the social media.
Again, his volunteerism and enthusiasm was and remains and inspiration to all whom  worked alongside Jerome.
Jerome  Siangco is a model for our younger generation.
His commitment to volunteerism  and his enthusiasm for charitable endeavors is remarkable.
He works from the  heart, never appearing to seek recognition.
I recognize this young man for  having an inner spirit that sets him apart from others.
I hope that SAMMI  Awards Foundation will also recognize this young man and let him know that his  spirit is contagious and to keep setting an example for all.
It is my  pleasure to write you on behalf of Jerome Siangco, a 15 year old sophomore at  Eastside Catholic High School in Sammamish.
As chairman  of the Sammamish Rotary Foundation, I have been one of the founders of an  Interact Club at ECHS.
Interact is a Rotary sponsored service club for high  school students.
Jerome has  been catalytic to rallying his classmates for community service so that the  ECHS Interact Club is one of the largest in Puget Sound.
Not only has he  stirred enthusiasm and activism with his peers but he has been exemplary in  leading the way to community service.
Jerome  volunteered multiple nights across the summer at the Sammamish Concerts in the  Park serving alongside of Rotarians to provide fun, family friendly experiences  at the Rotary hamburger stand.
Jerome also  volunteered multiple nights during October for the annual Nightmare at Beaver  Lake event, working a photo booth and adding to the fun memories of youth and  their families.
Jerome has  demonstrated a heart for service and a vision for involving others in making a  difference in our community and world.
I enthusiastically recommend Jerome  Siangco for your consideration of SAMMI recognition of Youth Spirit.
I am honored  to write a letter in support of Jerome Siangco’s nomination for the YOUTH  SPIRIT award.
In reviewing the characteristics for this award – helping others,  volunteering and setting a positive example, Jerome exemplifies these traits  like no other young teen I’ve known.
I first met  Jerome just last spring when he signed up to become a member of the new  Interact Club  Eastside Catholic Interact – Fidelis   when he was a freshman.
He was always prompt to meetings and was not shy about  contributing.
During the course of the year, I would see Jerome participating  in band, or the Super Fan Club, or Bamba Club  Eastside Catholic’s sister school  in Kenya, Africa , or the dance team, or as a Student Ambassador, and so on and  so on.
The point is – Jerome was EVERYWHERE.
This was not because he was a young  man trying to pad a resume; he simply enjoyed being active at school and  participating in activities that furthered the mission and spirit of Eastside  Catholic.
As the  Interact Club was just trying to get its legs, I needed someone who could get  the message out to the students and enlist new members.
The obvious choice was  the young man who was everywhere – and so I appointed Jerome as Director of  Recruitment.
Overnight  literally  I had at least 10 new members.
Then a few  more students the day after that.
Within a week, Interact was up to about 25  members and we now stand at close to 40.
As the sophomore year got underway,  Jerome – without needing direction – took it upon himself to speak at freshman  homerooms to talk about the merits of being a member of the Interact Club and  getting involved in the community.
He’s been my greatest asset and the greatest  advocate for the Interact Club.
When Jerome speaks to students about the merits  of the Club, he mentions friendship, community and service to others.
He takes  obvious great joy in talking about Interact and has thoroughly enjoyed the  outreach opportunities made available to him.
If Jerome  were to submit a resume to a college tomorrow, it would include the following –  volunteering at the Sammamish Rotary food booth; volunteer supervisor at St.
Anthony’s School in Renton; Acolyte Alter Server – St.
Anthony’s Parish; Dancer  for “Barrio Fiesta” – St.
Anthony School Filipino-American Community; Asia  Club; Student Ambassador – Eastside Catholic; Eastside Catholic Interact – Fidelis; Bamba Club; Junior State of  America.
Some of these activities extend as far back as middle school to  present.
And it’s important to know that these are not one and done activities  for him.

BLED, Slovenia – Glenn Ochal has been in big boat races many times before this.
He has been on three senior national teams and rowed in two boats that won the Head of the Charles Regatta.
S.

That is the most pressure I have ever felt going into a race,” Ochal said.
Pressure is off.

B final into second place and captured one of the last five of the 11 spots available for the Olympics.
S.
The men’s pair and men’s single sculls crews also placed high enough to qualify.
Also securing a spot to qualify for London in the Paralympic Games, was the legs trunk arms four with coxswain, which finished third in the semifinal and advanced to tomorrow’s final.
S.
The two boats hold the last chances for medals from the men’s squad.
By advancing to the final, they will also qualify the boat for the Olympics by completing the race.
B final.
While the medals count is important, the critical mission for the Olympic-class boats is securing spots for London.
The championships serve as the first opportunity for nations to qualify crews for the 2012 Olympic Games, although specific athletes won t be selected until next spring.
On the men s side, the top 11 finishers in the single sculls, double sculls, quadruple sculls, pair, four, lightweight double sculls and lightweight four all qualify their boats for the Olympics, while the top seven men s eights gain automatic qualification.
For the women, the top nine finishers in the single sculls; the top eight in the pair, double sculls and lightweight double sculls; the top seven in the quadruple sculls; and the top five in the eight will qualify their boats.

Bled will have another opportunity at the Olympic Qualification Regatta scheduled for May 20-23, 2012, in Lucerne, Switzerland.
Any crew that qualified on Lake Bled can consider its job fulfilled.
This feels great,” said Stitt, of qualifying the men’s quad.
It always feels great to qualify a boat for the Olympics.
I think the Olympics is a huge step for any athlete and I think this was our short and long term goal – to qualify, and we did just that.
B final.
It felt great to get the job done,” said Stangel.
We raced a hard semi yesterday; we maybe pushed a little bit harder than we needed to, but today, we were just confident in what we needed to get done.
Our coaches, Bryan  Volpenhein  and  head men’s coach Tim McLaren , have really helped us out this year, helping us find this late-end speed and helping us find our confidence.
Today we executed the best we have.
That was probably our best last 500.
We’re really happy.
Nichols and Hedstrom had to fight the entire length of the 2,000-meter course to secure a spot in the finals.
74.
That’s the way lightweight racing goes,” Nichols said.
It’s all the boats across, all the time.
You can’t expect to get out on anyone, and it’s competitive all the way to the line.
We’re really excited to have hit the qualifying mark for the Olympics and we’re looking forward to the medals tomorrow,” she said.
That was pretty awesome,” said Englert.
I always wanted to go to the Paralympics, not that I’m going to go, necessarily, but it was great to qualify.
I thought the race went pretty well.
I was a little worried; I never really hear the beep, so when I found out, I was pretty excited.
C final of the event and finished second in the race, and 14th overall in the regatta.
Watch all four days of finals, from Sept.

NEW YORK  AP  - Walk into Eddie DaRoza s office and you ll find two of him there: the actual 32-year-old video producer, and a 5-inch statuette of him.
There are a lot of double takes.
Los Angeles native said.
He had the statue made on a lark.
While waiting for his brother at a mall, he stepped into a studio that scanned his body and sent the scan off to a 3-D printer.
These studios are popping up rapidly as 3-D scanning and printing technology gets more advanced.
In New York City alone, there are at least four stores that offer the service, including three just in the past year.
You can get scanned in just a few seconds and get your statue delivered in days.
The advent of digital cameras and smartphones killed the traditional mall portrait studio, but 3-D printing has sparked a new trend.
Overloaded with digital photos, statues may be moving in to fulfill our desire for portraits that stand out.
Many of the customers of the statue studios are parents who want statues of their kids.
Sylvain Preumont, who opened a New York branch of his London-based iMakr store this year, said a soldier s wife had their three children scanned so he could bring them to Afghanistan.
Victor De Los Angeles, owner of New York 3-D printing and scanning store Cubo, has scanned several pregnant women.
New York s Museum of Art and Design offered scans and statues earlier this year.
Shapeways, the company that supplied the exhibit, said it scanned about 6,000 people and sold about 1,500 statues for $30.

The Smithsonian Institution scanned President Barack Obama and revealed a 3-D printed bust of him this summer.
It will be added to the National Portrait Gallery.
The typical 3-D-printed statue is printed in full color in a material known as  sandstone  - really, gypsum powder.
It s glued together by color ink ejected from a head similar to the one found in an inkjet printer.
The statues range from three to eight inches tall.
The technology allows for a lot of variation in materials.

Wal-Mart s British unit, ASDA, starting testing a service in November that lets customers buy 8-inch figurines of themselves for 60 pounds, or $100.
The studio is now permanent in one store, and it s been so popular that the company is considering rolling it out to other locations.
ASDA spokesman Russell Craig.
A Staples store in New York scans people s faces and puts them on NBA and Star Trek figurines.
The goal of the pilot program is to get small businesses to use Staples Inc.
3-D scanning and printing jobs, just like they ve provided those services for paper.
One example of what that might look like: A bakery that wants to use statues of the bride and groom as wedding cake toppers would need a printer that cost $60,000 or so, plus the expertise to use it.
Staples wants to do that job for them, for $70.
Before that can happen, small businesses like bakeries have to learn about the possibilities of 3-D printing.

AT&T Mobility LLC es una empresa filial de telefonía móvil completamente abosorbida por su casa matriz AT&T Inc.
8 millones de clientes ,  con lo que se convierte en uno de los proveedores de telecomunicaciones inalámbricas más grandes de los Estados Unidos, después de Verizon Wireless .
Para el tercer trimestre de 2010, AT&T Inc.
000 clientes.
6 por ciento , en comparación con los resultados del año 2008.
Originalmente Cingular Wireless LLC ,   alianza comercial entre SBC Communications y BellSouth  , adquirió a la antigua AT&T Wireless Services Inc.
2004; SBC Communications adquirió a la original de AT&T Corporation , remarcándola  The New AT&T   La Nueva AT&T .
Cingular Wireless se convierte así en la casa matriz de The New AT&T en diciembre de 2006 como resultado de la adquisición de BellSouth por AT&T Inc.
En enero de 2007, Cingular Wireless confirmó que podría renombrarse bajo el anterior nombre de AT&T Corporation.
Aunque el cambio de nombre comercial no se produjo inmediatamente, tanto por razones legales como por el posicionamiento que ya tenía la marca entre el público en general; estos dos nombres comerciales fueron utilizados en los logotipos de la empresa y en la publicidad durante el período de transición,  misma que concluyó a finales de junio, precisamente antes del lanzamiento del iPhone de Apple .
Entre los servicios que AT&T Mobility promovió agresivamente en los Estados Unidos, se encontraba su servicio de conservación de minutos  Rollover Minutes Service ,  en su popular plan Nation  Nación  con lo que le permitía a sus clientes conservar los minutos no utilizados en el mes corriente y pasarlos al mes siguiente durante un ciclo de doce meses.
A partir de julio de 2007, AT&T Mobility permite a los suscriptores del plan AT&T Unity  Unidad AT&T o AT&T Unida, doble sentido en inglés que fue usado en la publicidad y en los anuncios , tener el servicio de conservación de minutos, el cual era exclusivo del plan Nation.
Además, en el 2007, AT&T Mobility lanzó su servicio para compartir vídeo, en tiempo real, con la cámara incorporada al teléfono móvil, este servicio consistía en la posibilidad de transmitir una vídeo-llamada de un teléfono a otro a través de la red 3G en los aparatos telefónicos con esta capacidad.
AT&T Mobility lanzó el 20 de septiembre de 2009, un programa llamado A-List  Lista-A , similar a My Circle  Mi círculo  de Alltel Corporation  que posteriormente fue adoptado por Verizon Wireless con el nombre de Friends & Family {Amigos y Familia} .
Los suscriptores del plan individual Nation de USD $59,99 o de valor superior, podían utilizar el programa A-List, con el servicio de conservación de minutos incluido, y seleccionar hasta cinco números telefónicos nacionales para llamar a cualquier hora, incluyendo teléfonos fijos y números móviles de cualquier operador, sin usar ninguno de los minutos del plan.
Los suscriptores del plan FamilyTalk  Charla-Familiar  con planes de USD$89,99 o mayor cuantía, podían seleccionar hasta diez números con los que, cualquier persona de la familia suscrita al plan, podía hablar tanto como quisiese.

Cingular Wireless LLC fue fundada en el 2000 como una alianza comercial entre SBC Communications y BellSouth .
Cingular surgió de un conglomerado de más de 100 empresas.
Con 12 empresas bien conocidas de la región derivadas de Regional Bell Operating Companies  Compañías Regionales Operadoras de Telefonía Bell .
SBC Wirelss LLC , ya había operado en varios mercados del noreste de los Estados Unidos bajo la marca de Cellular One , mientras que las operaciones de telefonía móvil de BellSouth estuvieron vinculadas a la antigua Houston Cellular .
El linaje de Cingular Wireless LLC se remonta a Advanced Mobile Phone Service Inc.
AMPS Inc.
AT&T Corporation creó en 1978 para suministrar el servicio de telefonía celular en todo el país.
AMPS Inc.
Regional Bell Operating Company como parte del Proceso de liquidación de BellSouth .
Exceptuando a Pacific Bell Wireless LLC y BellSouth Mobility DCS Inc.
D-AMPS  Digital-Advanced Modular Processing System .
900 MHz  .
En octubre de 2007, El presidente y el director ejecutivo Stan Sigman de AT&T Corporation anunciaron sus respectivos retiros.
Ralph De La Vega , el presidente del Group Regional Telecom & Entertainment  Grupo Regional de Telecomunicaciones y Entretenimiento , fue nombrado presidente y director ejecutivo de AT&T Mobility.
41 millones de dólares estadounidenses .
Esto era más de dos veces el valor comercial de la empresa.
La fusión se completó el 26 de octubre de 2004.
La compañía combinada tenía un total de 46 millones de clientes en ese entonces, por lo que Cingular Wireless se convirtió en el mayor proveedor de servicios de telefonía móvil en los Estados Unidos.
AT&T Wireless fue legalmente nombrado New Cingular Wireless Services Inc.
11] Poco después, los comerciales de televisión muestran la transformación del logotipo de AT&T Wireless al logotipo de Cingular Wireless, el texto del logotipo de Cingular Wireless se vuelve azul para dar a conocer el cambio.
La primera emisión del comercial fue el 22 de junio de 2005, Cingular Wireless anunció la intención de suspender sus actividades en el Caribe y en las Islas Bermudas , licencias que adquirió Cingular Wireless al momento en que AT&T Wireless se apropia de la empresa irlandesa emplazada en Jamaica : Digicel Group , bajo términos financieros no divulgados.
En el 2006, un año después de la operación, una fuente de alto rango que estuvo presuntamente cerca de la negociación en Barbados , como lo señaló el periódico Daily Nation de Barbados al respecto de algunos documentos de la Security and Exchange Comission  SEC por sus siglas en inglés  hechos por Cingular Wireless, en los cuales puede establecerse una idea del monto de la transacción.
De acuerdo a los documentos de la SEC Cingular pagó cerca de USD$122 millones de dólares estadounidenses, gran parte de ese dinero estaría destinado a la compra de los antiguos activos de AT&T Corporation en Barbados.
Al momento de la fusión, existían dos redes: la histórica de AT&T Corporation  azul  y la red de Cingular  naranja .
Ambas redes contenían una mezcla de las tecnologías de acceso múltiple por división de tiempo  Time division multiple access TDMA , por sus siglas en inglés  y GSM .
000 estaciones de telefonía móvil tenían que ser fusionadas.
Desde un punto de vista técnico, las redes  azul  y  naranja  se consideraron diferentes hasta la integración, que se completó en el 2005.
18] Durante este proceso la Selección de red mejorada   ENS por sus siglas en inglés  fue utilizada en dispositivos ya sea para la red azul o naranja durante este proceso.
En California , Nevada , el norte de Nueva Jersey y Nueva York , Cingular y T-Mobile USA mantuvieron y compartieron una red GSM-1900 antes de la adquisición de AT&T Wireless Services Inc.
Comodidades y servicios GSM.
19] El acuerdo de compartir la red le permitió a Cingular ofrecer servicio local en el norte de Nueva Jersey y Nueva York y a T-Mobile ofrecer el servicio en California y Nevada.
El 25 de mayo de 2004, Cingular y T-Mobile USA anunciaron su intención de disolver dicha alianza supeditada a la exitosa adquisición de AT&T Wireless por parte de Cingular, la red de Cingular fue transferida a T-Mobile USA, y Cingular continuó trabajando en los servicios GSM en los emplazamientos de AT&T Wireless.
Como resultado de su formación a través de fusiones y adquisiciones, como también por el rápido cambio tecnológico en la industria de telefonía móvil AT&T Mobility opera redes en su área de cobertura en los Estados Unidos con diferentes estándares de comunicación inalámbrica.
El patrón básico tecnológico de la red inalámbrica de AT&T Mobility es el llamado sistema global para las comunicaciones móviles o GSM por sus siglas en francés.
Gran parte del área de cobertura de la red de AT&T Mobility actualmente utiliza el patrón 3G de telefonía móvil   UMTS   HSPA   para los circuitos conmutados y la conmutación de paquetes de datos, simultáneamente.
AT&T Mobility ofrece también el servicio Pulsa y Habla utilizando la tecnología de red de Kodiak Networks .
Cingular, la predecesora de AT&T Mobility, recibe el legado de las redes inalámbricas D-AMPS TDMA y análogas .
En marzo de 2006, Cingular anunció que esas redes serían cerradas en febrero del 2008.
A partir del 31 de marzo de 2007 Cingular dejó de soportar la TDMA para los clientes de GoPhone  Plan Pre-pago .
El 18 de febrero de 2008, AT&T Mobility finaliza oficialmente los servicios en las redes AMPS y TDMA , exceptuando las zonas en las que operaba Dobson Communications ; las redes AMPS y TDMA de ésta última fueron deshabilitadas el 1° de marzo de 2008.
Las redes que anteriormente eran operadas por los predecesores de AT&T Mobility, incluida Cingular con los servicios de Mensáfono  también llamado dispositivo de radio-búsqueda o radio-mensajería, buscapersonas, beeper, o familiarmente busca  de la división Cingular Interactive, la cual se convirtió en Velocita Wireless .
Velocita fue luego comprada por Sprint Nextel Corporation .
La red de datos de AT&T Mobility inició operaciones en el 2002 como una iniciativa de Cingular llamada Project Genesis  Proyecto Génesis  lo que involucró una superposición del GPRS sobre toda la red.
El Preject Genesis se completó a finales del 2004.
Más adelante esta red fue actualiza a EDGE en toda la extensión del GSM .
En el 2005, AT&T Mobility lanzó una red de banda ancha conocida como BroadbandConnect  BandanchaConectada , basada en UMTS y HSDPA para contrarrestar las EV-DO de Verizon Wireless y Sprint Nextel .
C.
2006.
A partir de los principios del 2009, AT&T Mobility completó su actualización de la red 3G al patrón HSUPA ,  e iniciaría una nueva tanda de actualizaciones para el patrón HSPA+ .
AT&T Mobility, Verizon Wireless, y otras compañías de telefonía móvil   Sprint Nextel Corportation da inicio a la única red al migrar al competido patrón WiMAX   optaron construir sus nuevas redes 4G , con una  Evolución a Largo Plazo    3GPP Long Term Evolution , LTE por sus siglas en inglés .
La LTE es el siguiente paso para dejar las tecnologías 3G , W-CDMA y HSPA y migrar a la tecnología GSM , también lo hizo así AT&T.
Esta nueva tecnología de acceso de radio será optimizada para ofrecer altas velocidades de transferencia de datos de hasta 100 Mbit s en descarga y 50 Mbit s en subida  tasas pico .
A las redes se les establece un límite de la velocidad para asegurar que todos los clientes podrán utilizar de manera eficiente la LTE.
Se espera que las velocidades sean realmente de entre 6Mbps a 8Mbps con la excepción de 20 Mbps  pico espacial  aproximadamente, sin embargo esto va a cambiar con el tiempo.
Diseñado para ser compatible con las técnicas GSM y HSPA , LTE incorpora múltiple-entrada múltiple salida  Multiple-input Multiple-output, MIMO por sus siglas en inglés  en combinación con la técnica división de Frecuencia Ortogonal de acceso múltiple  Orthogonal Frecuency Division Multiple Access OFDMA, por sus siglas en inglés , en los enlaces de descarga y en los de carga solitaria; acceso múltiple por división de frecuencia  Frecuency Division Multiple Access, FDMA por su acrónimo en inglés  en los enlaces de subida para proporcionar altos niveles de eficiencia espectral, la tasa final del usuario excedía los 100 Mbnit s, junto a importantes mejoras en la capacidad y reducciones en la latencia.
LTE soportó anchos de banda de canal de 1,25 MHz a 20 MHz tanto en FDD como en TDD en operación.
Verizon Wireless , anunció su intención de poner una activa LTE en línea de la red a finales de 2010.
AT&T Mobility no ha fijado una fecha oficial para comenzar a construir su red LTE.
Dependiendo de la cantidad de espectro que la compañía despliegue, se espera que AT&T desplegará 10MHz = 70Mbps.
AT&T ha notificado que comenzará su actualización a HSPA 14,4 como parte de su esfuerzo para mejorar su red inalámbrica 3G , así como la transición a LTE.
Además ha afirmado que sus mejoras se completarán a finales de 2010 después de que las conexiones de red de retorno que van desde sus torres celulares hasta la red troncal estén finalizadas.
El 20 de noviembre de 2005, Ed Whitacre , el entonces director general de la recién fusionada SBC AT&T, anunció los planes para comercializar el servicio de Cingular bajo la marca AT&T.
El portavoz de BellSouth Jeff Battcher respondió que los términos de la alianza comercial le permite, a cualquiera de las partes, vender el servicio con otro nombre, y que él cree que se va a utilizar la marca para los clientes del mercado.
25] El presidente de Cingular Stan Sigman concordó con la posición de BellSouth , indicando que la marca Cingular continuaría pero bajo la marca AT&T en la que se ofrecen paquetes con otros servicios de AT&T, tales como datos y telefonía fija.
Sin embargo, AT&T Inc.
05 de marzo de 2006  que adquiriría a BellSouth.
La adquisición se completó el 29 de diciembre de 2006, cuando la FCC emitió su aprobación final.
De acuerdo con AT&T Corporation, la compañía iniciaría el cambio de nombre de Cingular Wireless al de AT&T Mobility.
El 12 de enero de 2007 AT&T Corporation anunció  una mayor campaña de transición de marca de Cingular a la The New AT&T  La Nueva AT&T  en febrero de 2009 la palabra  New  fue removida .
Las anteriores tiendas de Cingular, después de haber sido renombrados con la marca AT&T, vendían todos los productos y servicios de AT&T: telefonía móvil, telefonía fija , Internet , U-Verse , y más.
El 14 de enero de 2007 AT&T lanzó por televisión la transición de la marca Cingular a AT&T a los clientes, mediante la creación del lema  Cingular is now The New AT&T   Cingular ahora es La Nueva AT&T .
El 15 de abril de 2007, AT&T Mobility comenzó a introducir nueva marca de teléfonos móviles AT&T.
En la etiqueta alfa  parte de la pantalla del teléfono, que muestra el nombre de la red a la que está conectado el teléfono  de la activación del teléfono nueva también se comenzó a leer  AT&T .
Aproximadamente el 11 de mayo de 2007, el nombre de Cingular fue sustituido por AT&T en la mayoría de los anuncios.
El 19 de mayo de 2007, el logotipo de AT&T sustituye al logo de Cingular en el automóvil que patrocinó en la NEXTEL Sprint Cup Series regulada por la NASCAR , propiedad de Richard Childress Racing y conducido por Jeff Burton .
Sin embargo, se retiró pronto, ver más abajo para más detalles .
El 24 de mayo de 2007, Palm, Inc.
Treo 680 que, entre otras cosas, actualizó la etiqueta alfa del teléfono  pantallas de inicio y apagado y los fondos de escritorio  de Cingular a los de AT&T.
Cingular.
En junio de 2007, las líneas de atención al cliente comenzaron contestar:  Thank you for calling The New AT&T, about your wireless service    Gracias por comunicarse con La Nueva AT&T, y preguntar sobre su servicio de telefonía móvil  .
Además, todas las nuevas tarjetas SIM estaban identificadas con el logotipo de AT&T.
El 16 de junio de 2007, la mayoría de los teléfonos en la red de la compañía AT&T la muestran como la proveedora del servicio en lugar de Cingular.
A principios de 2009, AT&T había retirado la parte  The New  de su marca en toda la publicidad y las comunicaciones.
En las líneas de servicio al cliente se comienza a contestar:  Thank you for calling AT&T   Gracias por llamar a AT&T .

Power and Associates  empresa prestadora de servicios de mercadeo  posiciona a Cingular consisitentemente en o cerca de la posición inferior de cada región geográfica en su  2006 Wireless Call Quality Study   Estudio de calidad de 2006 sobre telefonía móvil , que se basa en un estudio pequeño de 23 mil usuarios de telefonía móvil.
Sin embargo, muchos empezaron a quejarse de que tenían caídas de llamadas todo el tiempo con AT&T.
Esta campaña tenía que llegar a un abrupto final.
Desde 2008 hasta ahora, han habido muchos comentarios en blogs  diarios o bitácoras en línea  sobre lo mal que funciona la red de AT&T.
Telephia, cuyas pruebas a redes inalámbricas fueron hechas basadas en más de 6 millones de llamadas al año, lo que sirvió de fumadamento para decir que fue el mayor programa de estudio de redes de telefonía móvil del mundo, se negó inicialmente a dar los detalles de tal estudio, un vocero de la compañía dijo que; de acuerdo con The Boston Globe ,  Cingular no debería haber mencionado el nombre de la compañía Telephia a los medios informáticos .
34] La empresa de investigación indicó más adelante que Cingular, efectivamente, tiene una  significativamente menor taza de reducción en la caída de llamadas que sus competidores, estadísticamente hablando, a lo largo de algunos sectores del mercado y períodos de tiempo , pero que Telephia no tenía conocimiento de la metodología específica  mercados, períodos de tiempo o umbrales estadísticos  que Cingular utilizó para declarar su  menor cantidad de llamadas caídas .
35] Mientras que AT&T abandonaba su reclamo verbal de  El menor número de llamadas caídas  en sus anuncios televisados continuó mostrando situaciones en las que dos personas hablan entre sí con sus teléfonos móviles, y a uno de ellos se le cae la llamada.
AT&T afirmaría entonces que  Continuaremos haciendo hincapié sobre la importancia de no dejar caer las llamadas , esta campaña continua hasta hoy.
El 29 de junio de 2007, el iPhone de Apple Inc.
AT&T es el proveedor exclusivo del dispositivo en este país.
Poco después del lanzamiento del iPhone se produjeron problemas en el proceso de facturación de AT&T, los primeros en adquirir la innovación comenzaron a recibir mensualmente unas facturas excepcionalmente detalladas,   una de las más referencias a este hecho, con el blog en vídeo Factura de 300 páginas iPhone fue la productora y editora Justine Ezarik en su blog de vídeos  .

Cingular Wireless comenzó su patrocinio del vehículo número 31 de Chevrolet del equipo Richard Childress Racing en la Copa NASCAR .
En 2004 cuando Nextel  actualmente Sprint Nextel   compró los derechos del nombre a la Copa NASCAR y pasó a llamarse oficialmente Nextel Cup Series, Cingular y Alltel , patrocinador del vehículo número 12 de Dodge  propiedad de Penske Racing y conducido por Ryan Newman  , se les permitió permanecer como patrocinadores en virtud de una cláusula abuela .
A principios del 2007, tras la compra por parte de AT&T, Cingular comenzó un esfuerzo de re-marcado de AT&T Mobility.
NASCAR rápidamente afirmó que una cláusula en su contrato con Sprint Nextel, no permitiría a Cingular cambiar el nombre o marca anunciada en el coche número 31.
Después de fallar en su intento de persuadir a NASCAR de aprobar la adición del globo, logotipo de AT&T, en la parte trasera del coche, AT&T presentó una demanda en contra de NASCAR el 16 de marzo de 2007.
El 18 de mayo, AT&T ganó un interdicto preliminar en el Tribunal Federal de Distrito para el Distrito Norte de Georgia en Atlanta y, a raíz de una moción de emergencia no de una suspensión de NASCAR el 19 de mayo, remarca el automóvil número 31, ahora conducido por Jeff Burton , a tiempo para la Carrera de las Estrellas de la NASCAR de esa noche.
64] NASCAR solicitó posteriormente una apelación para ser oída el 2 de agosto.
El 17 de junio, NASCAR anunció que había presentado una demanda por USD$100 millones de dólares en contra de AT&T y que tal como con AT&T, quería a todas las otras empresas de telecomunicaciones fuera deporte para el 2008.
El 13 de agosto, un fallo del Tribunal de Apelaciones del Décimoprimer Circuito de los Estados Unidos abrió el camino para que NASCAR evitase que AT&T Inc.
El Circuito número 11 remitió el fallo a un tribunal inferior que le impidió a NASCAR detener los planes de AT&T.
La corte de apelaciones devolvió el caso al tribunal de distrito.
Jeff Burton en el Chevrolet Impala patrociando por AT&T en la Pista Internacional de Daytona Beach en el 2008.
En la primera práctica para la Sharpie 500 en la Bristol Motor Speedway el 24 de agosto, el coche número 31 era de color naranja y negro, pero estaba vacío, es decir, sin patrocinador principal  pero aparecieron patrocinadores asociados  en el coche, similar a la Fórmula Uno en la que los coches compiten en las carreras sin publicidad de tabaco pues está prohibida.
El equipo de mecánicos llevaban camisetas grises de la Richard Childress Racing y Burton tenía un traje de color naranja fuego normal con los patrocinadores asociados.
El coche que llevaba un esquema de  publicidad subliminal , llegó en una jaula negra sólo con el número 31 a un costado.
Los oficiales de la NASCAR dijeron que el coche no lo tenía durante la inspección de los logotipos de AT&T.
67] Durante ese fin de semana, AT&T dijo que había hecho llegar la propuesta de dos esquemas de pintura alternativos propuesto por AT&T-one publicitando su plan  GoPhone  y otra con el antiguo lema de Cingular  more bars in more places   más barras en más lugares  que AT&T había comprado recientemente, los cuales fueron rechazadas por NASCAR.
El esquema GoPhone había sido utilizado en el pasado.
68] NASCAR más tarde negó estas afirmaciones.
El vehículo quedó al descubierto en la noche de la carrera el 25 de agosto, aunque ESPN transmitió el logotipo de AT&T durante las tomas de dicho automóvil.
Fox Sports lo había hecho antes de la competencia, con las palabras  Cingular es la nueva AT&T  en la pantalla durante estas tomas.
El 7 de septiembre de 2007, se logró una solución en la que AT&T Mobility podría permanecer en el vehículo número 31 hasta finales de 2008, pero el patrocinio asociado al Chevrolet número 29 de Holiday Inn para la Nationwide Series no se verían afectados porque estaban en serie inferior.
Richard Childress Racing anunció que el patrocinio de AT&T Mobility se trasladaría a la carrera de autos deportivos de la Grand American Road Racing Association y en el 2009 con el patrocinio de la Childress-Howard Motorsports el número 4 de AT&T a la carrera de autos deportivos de la Pontiac Daytona Prototype .
Childress es un co-propietario de este equipo.
En el 2008, Verizon   Verizon Wireless   se adueñó completamente de Alltel , y junto con AT&T, a Verizon se le prohibió la publicidad en la Copa Sprint .
71] Tras la fusión, la decisión del Penske Racing se hizo para retirar los esquemas de Marlboro del coche número 12, donde los elementos de diseño de la empresa se muestra pero el logotipo de la empresa real no se muestra.
AT&T es el segundo operador de telefonía móvil en los Estados Unidos.

The Panasonic HX-A100 wearable wi-fi camera sits on display at the International Consumer Electronics Show, Wednesday, Jan.
8, 2014, in Las Vegas.
The camera features full HD recording as well as real-time broadcasting and SMS sharing via smartphone.
LAS VEGAS  AP  - Gadget lovers are slipping on fitness bands that track movement and buckling on smartwatches that let them check phone messages.
Some brave souls are even donning Google s geeky-looking Glass eyewear.
For the technology industry, this is exciting time, but also a risky one.
No one really knows whether the average consumer can be enticed to make gadgets part of their everyday attire.
The question is: Can tech companies create wearables with the right mix of function and fashion?
Wearable computing devices are igniting an explosion of hope and creativity that s engaged both startups and big companies including Samsung, Sony, LG and others.
At the International Consumer Electronics Show this week, companies are showing off hundreds of new watches, wristbands and eyeglasses with built-in video screens or cameras.
Fitbug Orb activity trackers are worn by an exhibit representative during the International Consumer Electronics Show, Sunday, Jan.
5, 2014, in Las Vegas.
Fitbug has introduced KiK Plans, which are the first ever customized exercise and diet programs that work with Fitbug activity trackers to provide the guidance needed to reach health and fitness goals for important occasions.
The industry is encouraged by the attention Google s Glass is getting.
The device is worn like a pair of glasses and projects a small video screen into the wearer s field of vision.
Companies are also encouraged by the success -albeit on a small scale- of the Pebble and Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatches.
Its CEO, Brian Krzanich, demonstrated a onesie that can measure a baby s temperature, pulse and breathing rate.
It sends a wireless signal to a parent s  smart  coffee cup, which shows a smiley face in lights if the baby is sleeping well and a worried face if the child is too hot or close to waking up.
The outfit can also send a signal to a smart bottle warmer, so it can be ready with warm formula when the baby wakes.
Krzanich said, showing off the brains of the onesie -a computer the size of a stamp.
The smart onesie is one example of the many gadgets at the show that are designed to demonstrate what technology can do.
What s less clear is whether they tackle real problems, and improve life so much that people will care to buy them.
Magellan Echo smart sports watches sit on display at the International Consumer Electronics Show, Wednesday, Jan.
8, 2014, in Las Vegas.
The watch can sync with mobile devices to make the most out of the user s sports apps.
The wearables industry is haunted by an earlier false start: Bluetooth headsets, which were commonplace a few years ago, fell out of favor.
The shift away from phone calls and towards texting was one factor, but many say it simply became uncool to walk around in public with a listening device protruding from one s ear.
It s easier to convince consumers to wear gadgets on their wrists, and that s where most of the industry s energy is focused.
Fossil.
Rosales has been making smartwatches for years, but only now does he believe they can break into the mainstream.
It s not so much a matter of technology - smartwatches worked fine in 2006, as one of social acceptance, he says.
S.
600,000 in 2013.
Russ Crupnick, senior vice president of industry analysis at research firm NPD Group.
S.
He thinks the image a smartwatch projects of the owner is a more important driver.
The June bracelet by Netatmo sits on display at the International Consumer Electronics Show, Sunday, Jan.
5, 2014, in Las Vegas.
The jewel on the band connects with an iOS device and alerts the user when the skin has received too much sun exposure.
Crupnick says.
Fitness bands are also an effective way to brand oneself, and they ve seen a big surge in interest recently.
S.
12 months, up from 3 percent the year before.
But the staying power of these products is questionable - much of their motion tracking can be done by smartphones, which already contain the motion sensors that let the fitness bands act as advanced pedometers.
At CES, some bands are being revealed that do more than phones can; Epson s Pulsense, for instance, measures a wearer s heart rate by shining a light through the skin.
It s developing a patch with a tiny needle that measures the wearer s blood glucose level and relays it wirelessly to a smartphone.
That could be useful not just for diabetics, but for anyone trying to control their eating habits.
The patch, which is at least two years away from being sold, would be worn discretely under clothing.
Google Glass is the opposite: it s blatant and in your face, literally.
Many people balk at the image of the man-machine integration it conveys, and since it contains a forward-facing camera, the gadget has given rise to privacy concerns.
In theory, Glass wearers could be recording or taking pictures of anything they see, unbeknownst to others.
Intel CEO Brian Krzanich talks about geo-fencing in a wearable tracker during a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show, Monday, Jan.
6, 2014, in Las Vegas.
But even if some people balk at wearing gadgets of their own accord others- such as children and workers -may not be able to avoid wearables.
New York-based Filip is making colorful, rubbery wristphones for kids.
They can track the kids location and can place calls to five pre-programmed numbers.
They can also show text messages, like  Time for dinner!  AT&T started selling them in November for $200.
Startup XOEye Technologies is building cameras into safety glasses.
They can stream live video for 45 minutes over Wi-Fi before they need a recharge.
The wearer can talk to and hear whoever s watching the video.
In effect, the glasses provide a way for an expert or supervisor to look over the shoulder of a remote worker to walk them through repairs.
Conversely, an expert could wear the glasses and walk the viewer through a process.
Anthony Blanco, XOEye s head of business development.
The gadget s battery life is too short for all-day video streaming, but the glasses can be set to snap photos every 30 seconds instead, which extends the battery s limit.
That could give employers a way to track workers all day, sort of like an eye-level security camera.
Blanco sees the potential for cutting down on worker s compensation fraud.
Blanco says.

Our trolls need to understand that their free market IS merciless.
As an international company, the concept of community means nothing to the new McBoeing.
Their duty and motivation is to make $$ for the shareholders and to enrich the managers.
Nothing else matters.
Moving ALL of any company to wherever the profits can be higher is implicit on pure capitalism.
There is NOTHING any government can do to compete with lower wages and higher govt subsidies.
China!
NOW things can get really ugly.
Why should McBoeing remain in the US at all?
The cost of moving headquarters to Chicago was peanuts, the cost of moving ownership to Beijing or Brazilia would be even less.
The only real strings keeping Boeing here is Troll-land are the likelihood that Unca Sam would not allow the Boeing defense IP to move out of the country.
NOW, oh Trolls, ask yourself if the same issue pertain to Airbus?
Airbus IS a European, socialist endeavor.
Yep, I have been channeling through SJ all along.

Pyongyang, October 27  KCNA  -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il visited the newly built Pothonggang Shop one August day this year.
After making round of the counters on the first and second floors, he stopped walking on the first floor and asked officials whether there was an elevator in the shop.
Hearing the reply of an official that it was not envisaged in the design as it was a two-storied building, he said: It may be difficult for the aged to go up to the second floor on foot.
It will not be a matter for the young people, but will be inconvenient for the aged and women to go up and down the stairs, carrying goods with them.
He admonished the officials that whatever they may do, they should perfectly promote convenience of the people, not any slightest inconvenience.
As seen above, he thinks first of the convenience of the people who will use it.

Amid an ongoing uproar over accusations that Israel harvested the organs of dead Palestinians, media watcher Andrea Levin issues a fresh plea to Aftonbladet to correct  the factual errors that litter the article .
Only a few generations ago laws prevented the teaching of the theory of evolution in some communities and regions in the United States.
The Bible was commonly accepted as true and a reliable account of our origins.
But now almost the opposite is true.
The Bible is banned from classrooms in American schools, and serious discussion of the biblical view of the creation of our universe—and our human origins—is forbidden.
At the same time, criticism of the theory of evolution is at times ruthlessly suppressed in academic and scientific circles.
We consider the evidence evolutionists cite to support the theory.
Perhaps most important, we look at the scientific facts evolutionists don t discuss in public—for reasons that will become clear.
You can know whether evolution is true.
What you believe does matter.

Tsafrir Abayov   AP Photo Israel thrived during the global collapse—thanks to an entrepreneurial culture built on compulsory military service.
S.
For all the press coverage of the Middle East, there is one side of Israel that gets scant attention: the country’s economy has the highest concentration of innovation and entrepreneurialism in the world today.
For years, multinational technology companies and global investors have been beating a path to Israel.
5 times greater than in the United States, more than 30 times greater than in Europe, 80 times greater than in China, and 350 times greater than in India.
And Israel still boasts the highest density of start-ups in the world  a total of 3,850 start-ups, one for every 1,844 Israelis .
More Israeli companies are on NASDAQ than companies from all of Europe, China, India, Korea, and Japan combined.
My personal concern is not with the opium but with the lack of alliances.
It seems to me the best way of thinking about Afghanistan is to divide it into three problems.
1.
Threat to the US.
We need enough force to assure that this will not happen again.
That result, however, is likley jnot dependent on who governs fghanistan.
2.
Threat to her neighbors.
US had NOT prevented Russia from taking over Afghanistan, wouldn t we be better off now?
Why can t we get a coalition of neighbors to work their will in Afghanistan?
3.
Opium.
Why do we care?
The majotr impact of Afghani Opium is on Europe and the Muslim countries.
If the Taliban did make the poppy the natural resource so many fear, how would that hurt the US?
Wouldn t the result be rreactions by Pakistan, Russia, Europe, Iran to the threat to their societies?
I am afraid that the big reason we are in Afghnaistan is Reagunesque US Cowboyism.
What happens if we decide that issue 1 and 2 are NOT US concerns?
There is a model for this sort of thing.
Mao s foreign policy was a sort of  do not ask. do not tell.   Even today China pursues an amoral self interest by working in its own national interest in cess pools like Burma or the Congo.
If we took a similar attitude, could the American public sput aside their need to do good?
Afghanistan issue.
What so we NOT know about US diplomacy?
When BHO came to office he had to deal with a precipitous fall in American influence in the world.
This has meant a continuous push t redefine our image and our relationships around the world with a goal of creating a new, multicentric balance.
Imagine this outcome.
Obama, Putin, Hu, Amadinejad, Sarkozy and Singh announce a summit.
The summit, chaired by Hu, announces a plan to replace the US Nato forces with a multinational force.
How would such a force work?
Ten lucky readers of The Local can now win tickets to watch the critically acclaimed Armando Iannucci satire In the Loop.
Starring Peter Capaldi, James Gandolfini and Tom Hollander, In the Loop is set in the political backrooms of Washington and London, as the President and Prime Minister try to drum up support for a war in the Middle East.
When a hapless British cabinet minister, Simon Foster, comments in an interview that war is  unforseeable , he is given a dressing down by the prime minister s agressive, foul-mouthed attack dog, Malcolm Tucker.
But Foster comes to be seen as a useful ally by various anti-war officials in Washington.
Flattered by the attention, he becomes a pawn in a political game that is way above his head.
In the Loop has won plaudits from critics on both sides of the Atlantic.
It is a spin-off from The Thick of It, one of Britain s most biting political satires, which points its guns at the pettiness, vanity and brutality of politicians.
West Wing-style glamour and high-mindedness is replaced by a sardonic, very British view of politics.

MOSCOW  Reuters  - Russia s President Dmitry Medvedev told leaders of three opposition parties on Saturday he was open to ideas on how to change election laws that they say favor the pro-Kremlin party.
The Nationalist Liberal Democratic Party  LDPR , Fair Russia and the Communist Party walked out of parliament this week in a rare act of protest against disputed regional elections, which independent observers say were rigged.
Russia s ruling party, United Russia, chaired by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, crushed opposition parties in the elections held across much of Russia, including Moscow.
63 Puddy I figured the  r  word would get your attention.
I have no problem with a Black guy who says those genes are irrelevant.
It is quite a different matter when you use your skin to defend your right to act like a racist.
You remind me of some librul Jews who crap on Israel and say that this is OK because a Yid can not be an antisemite.
You remind me of Medved or Rabbi Lapin.
You denigrate Obama by playing games with his middle name and playing on the use of the sound Black kids used in their song about him.
This would be the equivalent of my referring Michael Moshe Medved or Lapin the Cheredi.
What issues of equlaity do you take on?
You never take on the cause of equality whether that is pushing for the much needed better schools or criticizing the Reprican party for this persistent racism.
You play not the not so subtle racist attacks on ACORN.
You give Rev Wright no respect while tolerating Bachman, Beck, and Bush.

This is really not a right vs.
Condescending toward the c0rrupt Black government of Detroit is as bad as pretending Bush s policies were not a Christian failure.
Let me use some Jewish history to make my point.
In our Passover story we celebrate the liberation from slavery but not OUR liberation alone.
As Jews we are taught that the lesson of Egypt, the lesson of Spain, the lesson of the Shoah should gbe a lesson for all people.
Does this mean all Jews must be liberal?
Does it make Goldwater or Marx bad because they were converts?
No.
But when a Jew uses OUR heritage to defned herself against charges of bigotry, then the stakes must go up.
Same for Black people.
SJ admires Obama not because he is Black but because he uses his heritage to help all people.

Pyongyang, October 21  KCNA  -- The anti-Japanese heroine Kim Jong Suk was engaged in knitting by a campfire one night in November of Juche 26  1937 .
A guerrilla silently approached her and said that she should have a rest as the night was far advanced.
She made haste with her work, saying that it should be finished within the night.
He was surprised to see what she was doing.
She was knitting gloves by unraveling her woolen underwear.
The underwear was presented to her by members of a revolutionary organization.
She came back to the unit after carrying out the underground work a few days ago.
Then she told guerillas that she was moved to tears by the sincere souvenir the people had arranged by sparing every penny in dire poverty and would preserve the underwear with care and make revolution with credit until the day of the national liberation and live up to their expectation.
And she had kept it in her knapsack with care.
Next morning she handed to an orderly of the headquarters a package of the gloves which she had knitted all night.
She asked him to give the gloves to General Kim Il Sung without fail when it got colder and detailed him how to protect the General on march and during break.
Later General Kim Il Sung was told about the story.

Lobbying by the Am Cancer Society to limit sales the smoked form.
Hell THC is a lot cheaper to produce and is easily included in “heart healthy foods” like cookies and diet drinks.
4.
Of course, profit, cost and regulation will drive the market to RJ Reynolds, Proctor and Gamble, and Kraft.
Lee’s community will naturally fight to keep their “natural” product on the market, but they will lose most of the market.
Even Starbucks will want environmentally friendly Missippi Bud.
America dominate this new industry?
Is there a Marlboro Man, Ronald McDonald, or or Michael Jackson in the future of the American Marketing of Pot?
It may be fun for Lee and other to think about applying NOW for this job.
But I don’t expect that MJ-man will be in the hippy mold.
Imagine instead, something based on a software type, manly yet urban.

Deregulation to support a new UW Sustainable Business Model  - stephenm.schwartz@gmail.com :  The UW s Board of Regents recently posted the minutes from its October 15, 2009 meeting.
Current state forecasts are predicting further deficits in the State General Fund budget, raising the prospect of further reductions in State General Fund support for the UW.
The administration anticipates putting forward a number of proposals in the 2010 supplemental budget session related to providing the university with more management flexibility as well as more autonomy in controlling university resources, while preserving an appropriate level of accountability to the State as a public agency.
8 million replacement of Balmer Hall.
9 million per year would be used from the UW building account for debt service.
The state funded design for Balmer Hall has been completed.
It is most cost effective to proceed with construction as soon as Paccar Hall is complete in 2010.
This funding would also allow the UW to take advantage of the current excellent construction climate.
The Legislature was not able to fully fund the UW Tacoma Phase 3 project in the 2009-11 State capital budget.
In an effort to support the continued expansion of the UW Tacoma campus, the UW is considering supplementing State capital funds for the UW Tacoma Phase 3 project with a combination of UW Tacoma reserves, debt that would be supported by retail rental revenue, debt that would be supported out of the UW Tacoma operating budget, and debt that would be supported from building fee revenue generated by UW Tacoma students.
Legislative approval is required to utilize student building fee dollars for debt service; $513,000 per year would be used from the UW building account to pay for debt service.
If the legislature approves this issuance of building fee supported debt, the administration will present an action item to the Board of Regents that has a full financing plan and the specific project approval for completion of the remainder of the scope of the UW Tacoma Phase 3 project.
I realize that public education is in dire straights right now-- a situation that could be made even worse by the passage of I-1033.
But I m alarmed at the willingness of the UW President and Board of Regents to push privatization  passing the costs of higher education from the state to the students  and  deregulation  without much of any public discussion first.

Witches  By Christian Pastors :  EKET, Nigeria — The nine-year-old boy lay on a bloodstained hospital sheet crawling with ants, staring blindly at the wall.

ATLANTA, Georgia  CNN  -- An all-male college in Atlanta, Georgia, has banned the wearing of women s clothes, makeup, high heels and purses as part of a new crackdown on what the institution calls inappropriate attire.
The policy also bans wearing hats in buildings, pajamas in public, do-rags, sagging pants, sunglasses in class and walking barefoot on campus.
However, it is the ban on cross-dressing that has brought national attention to the small historically African-American college.
The dress-wearing ban is aimed at a small part of the private college s 2,700-member student body, said Dr.
William Bynum, vice president for Student Services.
We are talking about five students who are living a gay lifestyle that is leading them to dress a way we do not expect in Morehouse men,  he said.
Before the school released the policy, Bynum said, he met with Morehouse Safe Space, the campus  gay organization.
We talked about it and then they took a vote,  he said.
There has been a positive response along with some criticism throughout the campus, he said.
Senior Devon Watson said he disagrees with parts of the new policy, especially those that tell students what they should wear in free time outside of the classroom.
I feel that there will be a lot of resentment and backlash,  Watson said.
It infringes on the student s freedom of expression.
Senior Tyrone McGowan said he has mixed feelings about parts of the policy.
But I have been inspired by the conversation it has created,  he said.
We have to find a way to create diverse leaders from this college.
Those breaking the policy will not be allowed to go to class unless they change.
Chronic dress-code offenders could be suspended from the college.

Senior Cameron Titus applauds the change.

Teaching, research and clinical faculty members are eligible to vote.
If they vote to unionize, they would form a new chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which represents UConn faculty on the Storrs and regional campuses.
If we re going to move forward on that, we need to get all the parties together on the same page and figure out how we re going to go - which is the governor, the hospitals, UConn, Democrats, Republicans,   Donovan said.
When we did UConn $2 billion, everybody was in on it.
Right now, there seems to be less and less people interested in it.
I think it is very hard to capture a story about a union vote at the Health Center.
It is not just because the UCONN hospital is  cash-strapped , it is also about the undesirable alternatives recently being considered, like a twenty-five percent pay cut for faculty or the non-compete clause as considerations were being given to essentially turning over clinical operations to Hartford Hospital.
President Hogan is right; something has to be done.
Many faculty think a seat at the table is better than being in the audience in such deliberations.
The clinical and basic science faculty, the research and teaching doctors want as much as anyone to find a solution to this microcosm of the larger health care problem.
It is not just about a union vote.

Challenger Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco, which backs the BMW Oracle Racing team, told the SNG that it is considering filing a complaint with New York courts on the grounds of breach of fiduciary duty, in part because of the selection of Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, as the site of the best-of-three showdown.

Mr.
Scott St.
Claire, a paid right wing propagandist working for a tax free  think tank  called the Evergreen Freedom Foundation.
He also appears, without identifying himself as a political flack, on the liberal blog HorsesAss.
Who is EFF?
Like Fox News, the EFF claims to be non partisan.
Worse, EFF claims to be a non political organization and collects tax free donations.
Its leadership includes a number of far right local politicians, including John Carlson, as well the members of the far right talk radio  hosts.   Interestingly, if you donate to the EFF, they give you credit for a donation to their  mission.   It would be intersting to know if the EFF is actually a front for some church.
Recently the EFF sponsored, and probably subsidized, the appearance of Glenn Beck at SAFECO field.
In effect this was a publicly subsidized function of the Republican Party complete with several Republican candidates for office and booing sessions against Mr.
Obama and Ms.
Gregoire led from the speaker s podium.
What does Scottie St Claire do for this far right organization?
Mysteriously, his is the only staff job at EFF with no assigned tasks.
I’m part of that wing of the new journalism coming out of think tanks.
As I happens I remember Scottie talking about his job search when things were nto going well in the head hunter business.
EFF in part BECAUSE of his activity at HA.
Why would the EFF do this, except to hire him as a flack?
Typically his posts are shallow and lacking in any information.
The best one can say for Scottie is that.
Piper Scott does not use the N word or or call folks f–ckers.
My guess is that EFF would not find such speech appropriate for the  representative of a tax free foundation but does like to keep a finger in the muck to see how hot things might be.
By the way, PS has also been a paid flack of Glenn Beck’s favorite whipping boy the SEIU.
So perhaps he is simply a hired gun with no real beliefs?

Background: Identification of ubiquitin ligase substrates remains an unmet challenge.
Results: Two proteomic strategies were used to identify novel substrates of the E3 ligase HRD1.
Conclusion: These methods identified populations of substrates enriched for potential targets of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.
Protein ubiquitination is a key regulatory process essential to life at a cellular level; significant efforts have been made                      to identify ubiquitinated proteins through proteomics studies, but the level of success has not reached that of heavily studied                      post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation.
HRD1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been implicated in rheumatoid                      arthritis, but no disease-relevant substrates have been identified.
To identify these substrates, we have taken both peptide                      and protein level approaches to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins in the presence and absence of HRD1.
At the protein level,                      a two-step strategy was taken using cells expressing His6-tagged ubiquitin, enriching proteins first based on their ubiquitination and second based on the His tag with protein identification                      by LC-MS MS.
Application of this method resulted in identification and quantification of more than 400 ubiquitinated proteins,                      a fraction of which were found to be sensitive to HRD1 and were therefore deemed candidate substrates.
In a second approach,                      ubiquitinated peptides were enriched after tryptic digestion by peptide immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific for                      the diglycine-labeled internal lysine residue indicative of protein ubiquitination, with peptides and ubiquitination sites                      identified by LC-MS MS.
Peptide immunoprecipitation resulted in identification of over 1800 ubiquitinated peptides on over                      900 proteins in each study, with several proteins emerging as sensitive to HRD1 levels.
Notably, significant overlap exists                      between the HRD1 substrates identified by the protein-based and the peptide-based strategies, with clear cross-validation                      apparent both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating the effectiveness of both strategies and furthering our understanding                      of HRD1 biology.
The 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin plays a central role in the regulation of cellular processes.
In addition to targeting                      proteins for proteasomal degradation, ubiquitination modulates membrane protein trafficking   1  , alters protein-protein interactions, and controls the activity of many signal transduction pathways   2  .
A large family of enzymes involved in ubiquitin conjugation controls these diverse functions.
Ubiquitin conjugation to a target protein occurs via a three-step process.
First, the C terminus of ubiquitin is coupled to                      a ubiquitin-activating enzyme  E1  via a thioester linkage to a reactive cysteine residue on the E1.
Next, the activated ubiquitin                      is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  E2 , again coupled through a thioester linkage.
Finally, a complex of the                      E2 ubiquitin and an E3 ubiquitin ligase recognizes the substrate and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to a lysine residue                      on the substrate, forming an isopeptide linkage between the ubiquitin C terminus and the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue                        3  .
The many functions of protein ubiquitination combined with the wide range of proteins subject to this modification are reflected                      in the diversity of E3 ligases.
Several classes of E3s exist, the largest of which is the RING domain family, with over 600                      members predicted to be encoded by the human genome   4  .
The identification of substrates for this diverse repertoire of E3s remains a significant challenge for the field.
HRD1  also called synoviolin  is a transmembrane RING E3 originally studied in yeast and then mammalian systems for its role                      in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation  ERAD  2 of misfolded membrane proteins   5 , – , 7  .
It was independently identified as being up-regulated in synoviocytes from rheumatoid arthritis  RA  patients   8  .
Transgenic mice overexpressing HRD1 developed spontaneous joint pathology characterized by synoviocyte hyperplasia and                      invasion into cartilage and bone, whereas heterozygous HRD1 knock-out animals showed decreased susceptibility and severity                      in two arthritis models   8  .
Both peripheral blood cells and synoviocytes from RA patients display elevated levels of HRD1 mRNA   9  , and HRD1 expression is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines known to contribute to RA pathogenesis   10 , 11  .
Taken together, these findings implicate HRD1 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.
However, disease-relevant substrates                      of HRD1 remain to be definitively identified.
Initial proteomic approaches to study ubiquitination primarily used yeast systems expressing tagged ubiquitin   12  .
Affinity reagents directed at the ubiquitin protein have also been applied   13 , 14  , allowing the study of native tissues without the need for exogenous protein expression, and these tactics have been combined to increase specificity for ubiquitinated proteins   15  .
Approaches focused on enrichment of ubiquitinated proteins are complicated by the difficulty of confirming that the identified                      proteins are actually ubiquitinated.
High protein coverage is typically required to allow ubiquitination site identification,                      and targeted follow-up studies to demonstrate ubiquitination of select proteins are labor-intensive.
Gel shift analysis on                      a proteomic scale has been proposed and applied   16  , but a relatively high false positive rate is observed, and analysis may be confounded by other post-translational modifications                      of the observed proteins.
Recently, the use of an antibody directed against the diglycine moiety left on a ubiquitinated lysine                      residue after trypsin digestion has been reported to enrich ubiquitinated peptides   17 , – , 20  .
This strategy is implicitly specific for modification with ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like protein but has not yet been reported                      for the association of substrates with a particular E3 ligase.
In this study, we apply both protein level and peptide level enrichment in combination with siRNA technology and quantification                      by stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture  SILAC    21   to identify and validate novel HRD1 substrates.

To identify HRD1 substrates, we first established a method to enrich, identify, and quantify ubiquitinated proteins.
Proteins                      extracted from HeLa TREx cells expressing His6-tagged ubiquitin and grown in light or heavy SILAC medium, mixed at the point of harvest, were enriched for ubiquitinated                      proteins through a two-stage process.
Immunoaffinity enrichment of all ubiquitinated proteins was performed as the first step,                      with eluting proteins further enriched through an IMAC chemical affinity step specific for the His6-tagged ubiquitin.
We found that use of the two orthogonal enrichment strategies led to maximum specificity of the method                      for ubiquitinated proteins.
Proteins eluting from the IMAC enrichment were separated by SDS-PAGE and fractionated by slicing                      the gel lane into bands, with the proteins in the individual bands separately digested and analyzed by LC-MS MS.
The specificity of this method was validated using cells expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin as a negative control and comparing                      with cells expressing His6-tagged ubiquitin with quantitation by SILAC   supplemental Fig.
S1  .
In this experiment, ubiquitinated proteins derived from the His6-ubiquitin-expressing cells  heavy SILAC condition  are enriched compared with those derived from HA-ubiquitin-expressing                      cells  light , whereas nonubiquitinated background proteins are expected to appear at a 1:1 H:L ratio.
Several peptides derived                      from ubiquitin itself were identified and quantified in this study, and they were found to be enriched in the heavy form,                      as expected   supplemental Fig.
S2a  .
Many other proteins were observed as well, nearly all of which possessed a similar H:L ratio to ubiquitin itself   supplemental Fig.
2b  .
Quantitative analysis of these data using Elucidator revealed that the H:L ratio of the entire population of identified                      proteins is shifted to center around the ubiquitin H:L ratio   supplemental Fig.
S3  , validating the specificity of our two-step enrichment strategy and allowing for the assertion that essentially all proteins                      identified through this enrichment strategy are, in fact, ubiquitinated.
We applied our validated method to the task of identifying HRD1 substrates through the use of HRD1-specific siRNA technology.
A three-way SILAC study was performed, comparing cells treated with control siRNA to cells treated with two different HRD1-specific                      siRNAs   Fig.

We hypothesize that HRD1 substrates will have decreased ubiquitination levels and will be less abundant in our processed                      sample in cells with decreased HRD1 levels  both heavy SILAC conditions .
461 proteins were identified and quantified in this                      study   supplemental Tables S1 and S2  .
Most were quantitatively unaffected by the HRD1 knockdown, as expected   supplemental Fig.
S4  .
However, the levels of a fraction of these ubiquitinated proteins were decreased with HRD1 knockdown, making them candidate                      HRD1 substrates   Table 1  .
43  in the levels of these proteins after our ubiquitination-based enrichment in the presence                      of at least one Hrd1 siRNA as compared with the control, some decrease with both Hrd1 siRNAs, and an average reduction at                      least one standard deviation below the median of all proteins detected.
Note that, consistent with the known biology of HRD1                      and its involvement in the ERAD process, nearly all of the identified candidate substrates are transmembrane proteins, lending                      credence to the validity of our findings.

As a parallel approach, we pursued a second strategy toward the same goal of HRD1 substrate identification, but at the ubiquitinated                      peptide level   Fig.
1 b .
Tryptic digestion of ubiquitinated proteins produces a peptide from the substrate protein with a missed cleavage at the                      ubiquitinated lysine.
This lysine also retains the two C-terminal glycine residues from the ubiquitin protein attached to                      its side chain ϵ-amino group through an isopeptide linkage.
This non-native K-GG motif is easily identified by LC-MS MS as                      a 114-Da nominal mass shift localized to an internal lysine residue   11  .
The ubiquitin branch antibody   Cell Signaling Technology antibody 3925  has been produced to recognize and specifically immunoprecipitate peptides containing this K-GG motif.
Again using SILAC for quantitative comparison of cells with and without HRD1 siRNA, protein extracts were made and digested                      with trypsin.
Peptides containing the K-GG ubiquitination motif were enriched through immunoprecipitation with the ubiquitin                      branch antibody.
These peptides were eluted and analyzed by LC-MS MS, and relative changes with and without HRD1 siRNA were                      quantified using Elucidator.
Three different siRNAs were used to knock down HRD1 expression in parallel experiments to allow                      detection of single siRNA-specific events   supplemental Fig.
S5  .
This study resulted in identification and quantification of more than 1800 ubiquitinated peptides from over 900 proteins                        supplemental Tables S3 and S4  .
As expected, most ubiquitination sites were quantitatively unaffected by the presence or absence of HRD1, exhibiting a                      H:L ratio near 1:1   supplemental Fig.
S6  .
A fraction of these peptides were, however, quantitatively reduced in samples treated with HRD1-specific siRNA, making                      them candidate HRD1 substrates   Table 2 ; prerequisites for inclusion similar to those for Table 1 ; see table legend for details .
Some responsive ubiquitination sites, such as those on phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase                      type-1 α  PIP5K1A  and flightless 1 homolog  FLII , clearly do exhibit siRNA-specific effects   supplemental Table S3  , but most have reproducible quantitative results across all three siRNAs used, consistent with ubiquitination by HRD1.
As                      with our protein level approach, transmembrane proteins are again highly represented among the candidate HRD1 substrates.
Log2 SILAC ratio of HRD1 siRNA control  for each siRNA are reported.

Assessment of qualitative and quantitative reproducibility of this study was gained by replicating the study with HRD1 siRNA                      1, with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment as in our previous studies, and also without MG132 treatment.
This allowed                      us both to determine whether observed effects were MG132-dependent and to explore the fate of the HRD1 substrate candidates                      after their ubiquitination.
More than 400 ubiquitinated peptides were identified and quantified in this study, with the lower                      number caused by both the use of a shorter LC-MS gradient and the analysis of two rather than three independent samples in                      parallel.
Both qualitatively and quantitatively, the results of this study were consistent with the previously described experiment                        supplemental Fig.
S7  , with similar effects of HRD1 knockdown observed for candidate substrates both with and without proteasome inhibition.
Looking                      at peptides derived from the ubiquitin protein itself, the level of the ubiquitin K48-diglycine peptide is increased in the                      presence of MG132, as expected, because K48 linkages are associated with proteasome-targeted protein degradation.
Also as                      expected, the ubiquitin K63-diglycine peptide is quantitatively unaffected by MG132 treatment.
Both the protein level and peptide level enrichment strategies yielded collections of candidate HRD1 substrates that contained                      striking numbers of transmembrane, lumenal, and secreted proteins, 76 and 56%, respectively   Tables 1 and 2  , compared with 26 and 24%, respectively, for the total population of ubiquitinated proteins detected in the two enrichment                      approaches   supplemental Fig.
S8  .
That both methods identified candidate HRD1 substrates highly enriched for potential ERAD targets, consistent with the                      known function of HRD1, provides further support for the validity of our two approaches.
Comparing the results obtained by both the protein level and peptide level analyses reveals that a surprising number of candidate                      substrate proteins were identified by both of these highly divergent strategies, with similar quantitative effects of each                      HRD1 siRNA   Fig.
2  .
This qualitative and quantitative overlap gives us a high degree of confidence in the results obtained by each method.
Furthermore, HRD1 substrates identified by both methods can be considered validated, because two independent approaches have                      confirmed their sensitivity to HRD1, whereas proteins and sites of ubiquitination found by only one method are classified                      as candidate substrates until confirmation can be made by other means.
Substrates for HRD1 identified both at protein level and at peptide level.
Although the two methods employed used vastly different strategies, the population of candidate substrates from each approach                            is highly overlapping, validating both methods.
Representative HRD1 substrates are presented, with their quantitative response                            to HRD1 siRNAs both at the protein and peptide levels.
The error bars represent one standard deviation of the values obtained in the peptide level experiment for proteins for which more than                            one ubiquitinated peptide was identified.
To test whether substrates identified by our proteomic studies could in fact be ubiquitinated by HRD1, we examined the ubiquitination                      of ATP6AP1 in vitro   Fig.
3  .
In a ubiquitination reaction with ATP6AP1, HRD1 generated a ladder of more slowly migrating species indicative of polyubiquitination                      of ATP6AP1.
These species were not detected when HRD1 was omitted from the reaction, indicating that HRD1 is required for                      their generation.
In reactions performed with methylated ubiquitin, which prevents elongation of ubiquitin chains, monoubiquitinated                      ATP6AP1 was still detected, but more slowly migrating species were eliminated, confirming that the ladder seen in the second lane of Fig.
3 is due to polyubiquitination of ATP6AP1.
That HRD1 can promote ubiquitination of ATP6AP1 in a biochemical assay further confirms                      that our proteomic approaches identified bona fide HRD1 substrates.
FIGURE 3.
In vitro ubiquitination of ATP6AP1 by HRD1.
ATP6AP1 was incubated with HRD1, ubiquitin  Ub  or methylated ubiquitin  me-Ub , and E1, E2  UbCH5B , and ATP as indicated.
The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and ATP6AP1 species were detected                            on Western blots probed with a monoclonal antibody to ATP6AP1.
Migration of molecular mass markers in kDa is indicated.
Striking among the substrates identified by both methods is the MHC class I molecule HLA.
In a recent study of ERAD of HLA,                      depletion of HRD1 with siRNA impaired degradation of misfolded HLA, as did overexpression of a dominant negative form of HRD1                        24  .
In addition, HRD1 depletion reduced HLA ubiquitination in cells, and HRD1 coimmunoprecipitated with misfolded, but not                      properly folded, HLA.
The identification of an independently validated HRD1 substrate in our study further confirms the power                      of our methods.
The role, if any, of the HRD1 substrates we have identified in rheumatoid arthritis of course remains to be elucidated.
HRD1                      overexpression in RA would be predicted to down-regulate cell surface HLA and hence class I antigen presentation.
Mice lacking                      CD8+ T cells, which recognize antigen presented by class I, develop disease normally in arthritis models   25  .
However, CD8+ Treg cells have been reported to suppress a mouse model of arthritis   26  , suggesting that in the appropriate context, down-regulation of class I by overexpressed HRD1 might promote inflammation.
CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with 17 different protein isoforms described in the UniProtKB database.
CD44-deficient                      mice show increased disease in arthritis models   27  , consistent with the hypothesis that HRD1-driven down-regulation of CD44 might contribute to RA.
However, CD44 blocking                      antibodies reduce the severity of mouse arthritis models   24  .
Therefore, an understanding of the sites of HRD1 overexpression and knowledge of the functions of the CD44 isoforms expressed                      at those sites is needed before a disease role for HRD1-mediated ubiquitination of CD44 can be assigned.
Finally, both the protein level and peptide level enrichment studies identified multiple integrin chains as potential HRD1                      substrates.
Among these, integrins α3 and α6 were validated in both studies.
Integrin α6β1 has been shown to be expressed                      in fibroblast-like synoviocytes   28  , the cell type in which HRD1 was originally shown to be overexpressed in RA.
Integrin β1 was a strong candidate substrate                      in the peptide level enrichment study   Table 2  , whereas one of two siRNAs decreased its signal in the protein level enrichment experiment   supplemental Table S1  .
Thus, it is possible that HRD1 down-regulates both chains of integrin α6β1 in RA synoviocytes.
This down-regulation could                      alter the adhesion or migratory behavior of synoviocytes and hence their invasion into cartilage in bone, contributing to                      disease.
However, in all cases, demonstration that HRD1 overexpression reduces the cell surface expression, and function of                      the substrates we have identified awaits experimental confirmation.
In summary, we have established and utilized two approaches to identify substrates of the ubiquitin E3 ligase HRD1.
Each approach                      is effective, and a similar population of ubiquitinated proteins has been discovered using each method, allowing confident                      identification of HRD1 substrates.
These two strategies can be readily applied to interrogate the biology surrounding other                      E3 ligases and could be easily adapted to the study of other enzymes in the ubiquitin pathway as well as other ubiquitin-like                      molecules.
We thank Hao Chen for construction of tagged ubiquitin expression vectors, Roxanne Splett-Young for expert and patient bureaucratic                      navigation, and Jo Hulme and Duke Virca for support of this work.

Studies of traumatic brain injury from all causes have found evidence of chronic hypopituitarism, defined by deficient production of one or more pituitary hormones at least 1 year after injury, in 25–50% of cases.
Most studies found the occurrence of posttraumatic hypopituitarism  PTHP  to be unrelated to injury severity.
Growth hormone deficiency  GHD  and hypogonadism were reported most frequently.
Hypopituitarism, and in particular adult GHD, is associated with symptoms that resemble those of PTSD, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, irritability, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, cognitive deficiencies, and decreased quality of life.
However, the prevalence of PTHP after blast-related mild TBI  mTBI , an extremely common injury in modern military operations, has not been characterized.
We measured concentrations of 12 pituitary and target-organ hormones in two groups of male US Veterans of combat in Iraq or Afghanistan.
One group consisted of participants with blast-related mTBI whose last blast exposure was at least 1 year prior to the study.
The other consisted of Veterans with similar military deployment histories but without blast exposure.
Eleven of 26, or 42% of participants with blast concussions were found to have abnormal hormone levels in one or more pituitary axes, a prevalence similar to that found in other forms of TBI.
Five members of the mTBI group were found with markedly low age-adjusted insulin-like growth factor-I  IGF-I  levels indicative of probable GHD, and three had testosterone and gonadotropin concentrations consistent with hypogonadism.
If symptoms characteristic of both PTHP and PTSD can be linked to pituitary dysfunction, they may be amenable to treatment with hormone replacement.
Routine screening for chronic hypopituitarism after blast concussion shows promise for appropriately directing diagnostic and therapeutic decisions that otherwise may remain unconsidered and for markedly facilitating recovery and rehabilitation.
The risk factors and the mechanisms, other than immediate trauma-induced tissue damage and subsequent edema, for chronic hypothalamo-pituitary dysfunction due to TBI are unclear.
Roles for polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E genotype  APOE , inflammatory processes – both systemic and neural, and anti-hypothalamic  AHAs  and anti-pituitary antibodies  APAs  have been proposed, and each has empirical support.
There is evidence that the apolipoprotein E  APOE  ε3 ε3 genotype may be associated with a reduced risk of TBI-related hypopituitarism.
APOE ε3 is the most common of the three alleles and is found in more than half of the general population.
The ε2 and ε4 alleles have been associated with altered risks for Alzheimer’s disease, hyperlipoproteinemia, and atherosclerosis.

2009 ; Ziebell and Morganti-Kossmann, 2010  .
In addition, animal studies provide evidence of the development of a chronic inflammatory state after TBI.
Three months after moderate focal brain injury in rats, persistent major histocompatibility complex  MHC -II up-regulation, mononuclear phagocytosis, and elevated interleukin-1β  IL-1β  and tumor necrosis factor-α  TNF-α  synthesis were observed in large areas of the ipsilateral hemisphere   Holmin and Mathiesen, 1999  .
In another study, 2 months after cortical contusion injury to the medial frontal cortex of rats, IL-1β was significantly increased in the cortex and hypothalamus compared with a sham–trauma group, and glial fibrillary acidic protein  GFAP  was elevated in the cortex, hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary of the TBI group   Kasturi and Stein, 2009  .

EDTA , placed on ice, and centrifuged at 4°C prior to removal of the plasma fraction.
Blood samples for measurement of serum hormones were collected in serum-separator tubes, allowed to clot at room temperature for 10 min, and centrifuged to isolate serum.
Serum and plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at −70°C.
Twelve pituitary or target-organ hormones were measured in these samples.
The type, source, and performance characteristics of the assay kits used for the measurement of hormone concentrations in serum and plasma are shown in Table 1 .
ACTH, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone  TSH , oxytocin, and vasopressin concentrations were determined in plasma; free thyroxine, luteinizing hormone  LH , follicle-stimulating hormone  FSH , total testosterone, insulin-like growth factor-I  IGF-I , growth hormone, and prolactin were measured in serum.
Measurements of plasma and urine osmolality were not available but urine specific gravity was measured and used as a criterion to determine functional vasopressin insufficiency.
The criteria for PTHP, derived using hormone measurements from the 59 community control participants are shown in Table 2 .
For each hormone, age-adjusted percentiles based on the lognormal distribution from community control participants were estimated and dysfunction in each of seven hormonal axes was defined   R Development Core Team, 2011  .
Hypopituitarism was defined as a dysfunction in at least one of these seven axes.
These criteria were modeled after those used in published studies of hypopituitarism after TBI from all causes.

Five Veteran participants with mTBI  T-4, T-8, T-16, T-25, and T-28  were found to have serum IGF-I concentrations below this cutoff line.
None of the Veteran participants in the DC group were found to have subnormal age-adjusted IGF-I levels  Figure 1  .

The screening criterion for growth hormone deficiency was an IGF-I level below the age-adjusted 10th percentile of IGF-I concentration  diagonal red line  in the community control reference group.
Serum IGF-I values of five Veterans with mTBI fell below this cutoff line.
None of the DC group met this criterion.
Three participants with mTBI  T-4, T-13, and T-28  were found with abnormal hormonal profiles indicating probable hypogonadism.
The criteria were a total testosterone concentration less than the 5th percentile of the reference sample together with an LH or FSH level below the 10th percentile reference level  Figure 2 ; Table 2  .
989 .
Elevated prolactin levels in conjunction with low testosterone are also indicative of hypogonadism.
A serum prolactin concentration markedly higher than the 95th percentile of the reference sample was found in serum from participant T-4.
A subnormal prolactin concentration  <5th percentile , also associated with sexual dysfunction, was measured in serum from T-13.

Green circles mark data from 3 T subjects falling below both cutoffs.
No DC subjects met both criteria.
None of the Veterans in the DC group were found to have hormone levels indicative of hypogonadism.
One participant in the DC group was found with a total testosterone concentration below the 5th percentile reference standard and another had an LH concentration below the 10th LH percentile, but neither exhibited the combined gonadotropin and testosterone deficiencies consistent with hypogonadism.
None of the Veteran participants in either the T or DC group exhibited abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary–adrenocortical or hypothalamic-pituitary–thyroid axis  Table 3  .
The corticotrophs and thyrotrophs are located in the protected median wedge of the anterior pituitary and are anatomically less vulnerable to injury than gonadotropin- and GH-secreting cells.

In addition to the findings of anterior pituitary hormone abnormalities in six Veteran participants with mTBI, eight instances of anomalous posterior pituitary hormone levels were found in six Veterans in the mTBI group, one of whom, T-28, also had evidence of presumptive GHD and hypogonadism.
The plasma oxytocin concentration was unmeasurably low in this individual  Table 3  .
None of the Veterans in the DC group were found to have abnormal posterior pituitary hormone values.
Three additional participants from the mTBI group  T-10, T-14, and T-22  also were found to have circulating oxytocin concentrations below the reference sample’s 5th percentile level.

In addition, plasma vasopressin concentrations in participants T-2 and T-12 were abnormally elevated above the 95th percentile of the reference group.
After completion of hormone measurement and identification of Veterans with apparent hypopituitarism, participants in the T group were divided into two subgroups, based on the presence or absence of hormone abnormalities, for comparison of demographic, deployment history, blast exposure, and medication use data with each other and with the DC group.
The three groups of Veteran participants did not differ in age, education, or body mass index at the time of enrollment, and the two mTBI subgroups did not differ significantly from one another on any of the measures of deployment history or blast exposure  Table 4  .

Our findings in this preliminary study support the hypothesis that blast mTBI carries a risk of PTHP similar to that found in several previous studies of hypopituitarism in the general population after TBI from all causes.
We have found that blood samples from 11 of 26, or 42% of Veterans of combat in Iraq or Afghanistan had abnormal circulating hormone concentrations consistent with PTHP.
Five participants with blast mTBI exhibited evidence of anterior pituitary dysfunction, five additional subjects had anomalous posterior pituitary hormone levels, and the eleventh was found to have both anterior and posterior pituitary hormonal abnormalities.
In contrast, none of the seven Veterans of deployment to Iraq and or Afghanistan in the study who did not experience blast trauma – the DC group – were found to have evidence of pituitary dysfunction.
As Kokshoorn et al.
2010  pointed out in their review of 14 investigations of PTHP conducted between 2000 and 2009, these early studies used a broad variety of screening criteria that were sometimes described in general terms rather than with specifically defined cutoffs.
We attempted to use relatively conservative and explicitly defined criteria based on the distribution of specific hormone concentrations measured in a reference population.
LH, FSH, and prolactin to screen for hypogonadism.
It should be cautioned that the determinations of basal hormone concentrations, such as those made in this study, are meant to be screening tools, and are not intended to be, nor should they be interpreted to be, diagnostic in the absence of clinical assessment.
Measurement of basal circulating hormone concentrations is generally considered an appropriate screening tool for provisional identification of deficient thyroid function, hypogonadism, and prolactin and oxytocin deficiencies.
Diagnosis of significant abnormalities of vasopressin secretion normally require confirmation by measures of plasma and or urine osmolality, urine specific gravity  UGS , and or the administration of a water deprivation test.
Although provocative testing is generally considered necessary for diagnosis of sAI and GHD, measurement of basal cortisol and IGF-I concentrations remain valuable screening tools to identify individuals most likely to benefit from additional testing and clinical referral.
Evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms are essential for definitive diagnoses in all cases.
Previous studies have found GHD to be the most prevalent chronic endocrine consequence of TBI, and it carries with it a potentially large range of symptoms.
Provocative testing is considered to be a requisite for the reliable diagnosis of GHD because serum GH concentrations measured in the morning are not valid indicators of daily secretion or somatotroph function.
1992  .
However, GH stimulates hepatic production of IGF-I that provides a useful index of somatotroph function.
IGF-I concentrations have low diagnostic sensitivity for identifying GHD but are highly specific.
The presence of normal IGF-I values cannot be used to exclude GDH because it is often diagnosed in individuals with normal or even elevated IGF-I levels.
2011  .
Circulating IGF-I concentrations decline markedly with increasing age, and this decline must be taken into account when interpreting them.
2005  .
4 SDs below the age-adjusted means of the reference sample.
The high specificity of IGF-I measurements at this level assures a very low likelihood of false positives in diagnosing GHD.
However, in light of the low sensitivity of IGF-I concentrations in predicting GHD, it is probable that some Veteran participants with normal IGF-I levels may be growth hormone deficient.
The long-term sequelae of GHD in adults for health, quality of life  QoL , and morbidity are multifaceted and complex.
2010  .
GHD also has significant deleterious effects on body composition and cardiovascular function.
Adult GHD is associated with lipidemia, reduced lean body mass, and increased adiposity.
2006a , b ; Colao, 2008  .
2008  .

Many of the symptoms of GHD can be successfully ameliorated or reversed by growth hormone replacement therapy.

Three of the Veteran participants in the T group met our criteria for hypogonadism: a total testosterone concentration less than the 5th percentile of the reference sample together with an LH or FSH level below the 10th percentile reference level.
2010b  .
Hypogonadism has significant deleterious consequences in addition to its adverse effects on fertility, psychosexual function, and general well being.
Testosterone deficiency in males is associated with decreased energy and motivation, muscle weakness, reduced lean body mass, and impaired exercise tolerance   Agha and Thompson, 2005  .
2001  .
5 times higher than the next highest concentration measured in the T group and more than four times higher than the highest value in the DC group.
Hyperprolactinemia has been causally linked with hypogonadism, specifically by reducing LH and FSH secretion, blocking LH stimulation of testicular testosterone secretion, and producing oligospermia by reducing FSH levels, resulting in hypoactive sexual desire and erectile dysfunction.
Prolactin is the only anterior pituitary hormone that is under predominantly inhibitory control.
Its secretion is suppressed by dopamine, and in the absence of this inhibition, prolactin is released at high levels.
Hyperprolactinemia frequently results from the use of antipsychotic medications that act as antagonists at dopamine D2 receptors   Holt, 2008 ; Inder and Castle, 2011  .
2011  .
2004  .
T-4.
One of the Veterans with mTBI was found to have a subnormal  less than 5th percentile  prolactin concentration.
2009  .
We found no evidence of dysfunction in the thyroid or adrenal axes as a result of blast mTBI.
2010  .
This pattern may be due in part to the location of pituitary corticotrophs and thyrotrophs in the gland’s protected median wedge and their blood supply via both the long hypophysial portal vessels and the inferior hypophysial artery.
GH-secreting somatotrophs, on the other hand, are anatomically more vulnerable to damage because of their location in the pituitary’s exposed lateral wings and their primary dependence on vascular input from the portal system alone.
Gonadotrophs are distributed throughout the anterior pituitary, and the cells in the lateral wings are relatively vulnerable.
In addition to the six participants with hormonal levels consistent with hypogonadism and or GHD, six of the Veterans with mTBI  including one with anterior pituitary hormonal abnormalities  exhibited abnormal plasma vasopressin and or oxytocin concentrations.
Oxytocin concentrations below the 5th percentile value of the community control group were observed in four of the mTBI participants.
003.
The occurrence of deficits of both vasopressin and oxytocin in two participants suggests the possibility of disruption of the pituitary stalk or hypothalamic damage in these individuals.
In addition, elevated plasma vasopressin concentrations above the reference 95th percentile were measured in two subjects.
Our finding of a high frequency of abnormal peripheral hormone levels after blast mTBI in this preliminary study is consistent with the investigations cited above, in which the prevalence of pituitary dysfunction fell in the 30–60% range in 11 of 22 reports.
However, in general, those studies focused exclusively on anterior pituitary dysfunction.
2004  , found significant evidence of damage in that lobe as well.
1% of this group as well.
2001  .
The only other ongoing study of hypopituitarism after blast mTBI of which we are aware recently reported preliminary results based on two retrospective chart reviews.
Of 147 Marines with blast-related mTBI screened approximately 1 year or more after injury, 25% were found to have abnormal levels of one or more anterior pituitary hormones   Stokes and Gallagher, 2011  .
The Veteran groups in this study are highly similar in demographic characteristics and share the common experience of deployment under highly stressful and dangerous conditions accentuated by extreme heat and the burden of heavy equipment even when not actively engaged in combat.
Despite these commonalities, the experience of blast trauma and the combat situations in which these exposures occur have major long-term consequences well beyond those of deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan.
The considerable overlap between the constellations of symptoms typical of chronic hypopituitarism and persistent post-concussive symptoms  PPCS , in addition to the similarities of both to PTSD, make accurate diagnosis of the etiology, progression, and identifiable differences between the conditions of critical importance for successful treatment, recovery, and rehabilitation   Masel, 2005  .
The consequences of undiagnosed and untreated pituitary hormone deficiencies are manifold and significant and include diminished QoL, cognitive deficiencies, fatigue, sleep disturbance, sexual dysfunction, deleterious changes in metabolism and body composition, behavioral and psychiatric problems including anxiety, irritability, social isolation, depression, and increased cardiovascular mortality.
PTHP, unlike PTSD and PPCS, is readily treatable if correctly diagnosed, and many of its symptoms can be reversed or ameliorated with appropriate hormone replacement therapy.
To our knowledge, this is the first published study of basal hormonal evaluation of combat Veterans with blast mTBI, and our preliminary findings of PTHP in 42% of study participants supports the advisability of routine screening for hypopituitarism after brain injury in both military and civilian populations.
Routine provocative testing for sAI and for GHD, the most frequently observed chronic endocrine disorder resulting from TBI, is neither economically nor practically viable.
However, measurement of basal concentrations of a panel of pituitary and target-organ hormones similar to those performed here may provide valuable preliminary indications of those individuals most likely to benefit from further clinical evaluation.
Similar preliminary screening for pituitary dysfunction after blast concussion shows promise for appropriately directing diagnostic and therapeutic decisions that otherwise may remain unconsidered and for markedly facilitating recovery and rehabilitation.

JOE SCARBOROUGH, on “Morning Joe,” re the AP phone-record seizure: “This goes beyond incompetence.
BREAKING – “RGA: Name a special prosecutor,”  by Kevin Robillard: “The Republican Governors Association’s leadership on Tuesday called on President Barack Obama to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups.
To be blunt, this is Big Brother come to life and a witch hunt to prevent Americans from exercising their First Amendment rights,’ Wisconsin Gov.
Scott Walker and Louisiana Gov.
THE BIG PICTURE -- “Scandal politics sweep Capitol Hill,” by Jake Sherman and Lauren French: “Two separate committees — Oversight and Government Reform, and Ways and Means — will probe whether the IRS was treating right-leaning groups unfairly.
Republicans moved swiftly to secure the IRS acting director for a Friday hearing … GOP aides hinted … that widespread calls for the director’s resignation could come shortly.
Ways and Means Republicans say they are interested in when top IRS officials, specifically former Commissioner Douglas Shulman, was told about search terms used to single out conservative groups.
Shulman told Ways and Means members in March 2012 that the IRS was not engaged in any manner of political targeting.
Top GOP sources acknowledge that it’s highly unlikely the White House was directly involved in the IRS mess … There are currently five separate committee investigations into the attack … in Benghazi, and a probe into Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius raising millions of dollars to promote Obamacare.
Ways and Means is demanding answers to seven questions on this matter, as well.
R]oughly one-third of House committees are engaged in investigating some aspect of the Obama administration.
As Obama tries to jump-start immigration reform and a deficit deal and raise the debt ceiling, it’s becoming clear it could be a long, hot summer for the White House.
The uptick in oversight opens a new chapter in Boehner’s tumultuous relationship with Obama, and ensures that the president and House GOP’s political fortunes will be determined in the unpredictable committee hearing process.
Focusing on scandals that play well with its base ahead of the 2014 midterms is great politics for the House GOP leadership.
Republicans have little to do legislatively, as this week it will pass for the 37th time a repeal of Obama’s health care law.
It’s commonplace these days to see bills that could be completed in one day take most of the week.
The decision to engage in a multipronged attack against the Obama administration poses both risks and rewards for the Republican leadership.
The party has yet to fully coalesce around a legislative agenda, a plan to raise the debt ceiling or a broad-based governing strategy.
Republicans, who have tried to soften their image, now risk being defined by shouting matches.
Their job-creating message is in danger of being overshadowed by scandal.
Perhaps the best thing about this spate of investigations is that it has unity without having to scrounge 218 votes for any legislation.
But the risks for Obama could not be greater.
He has just 3½ years to legacy, hardly an easy task when Congress is at war with him.
Imagine cutting an immigration deal with Issa — who is involved in that debate — when he’s dragging administration officials in front of his committee all summer.

You may want to sit down for this.
Then get up.
Then sit down again.
That s because there s a desk out there that tells you to do exactly that.
The Stir Kinetic is probably the world s first  smart  desk.
It has a built-in touch screen, so you can see this either as a desk with a smartphone in it or a smartphone with a desk attached.
Why does a desk need to be smart?
One answer is that it has motors and needs smarts to control them.
The motors raise and lower the desk surface.
You program it with the height you need for sitting and the height you need for standing.
It moves, quietly, between them.
The other reason the desk needs smarts is that you don t have them.
Well, not you, in particular, but people like you.
Apparently we know that sitting all day is not good for us, but when we get motorized desks, we don t use them very much.
Swedish researchers put it in 2005.
Stir was founded by a former Apple engineer, making it sort of like the Nest thermostat of desks.
Both are everyday objects imbued with top-notch software.
The Nest figures out when you re home and varies the temperature accordingly; the Stir desk knows if you re in front of it.
The Stir knows if it s at the standing or sitting level and keeps track of how long you ve been in that position.
After 20 minutes or whatever interval you select, it will tell you to switch positions.
It does so by  breathing  - it gently moves up an inch, then settles down.
Nothing further happens unless you tap the touch screen twice to confirm you want to change positions.
You can buy a  dumb  motorized standing desk for $1,500.
There are also some nifty designs with mechanical counterbalances for the same price.
There was even a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign offering a bare-bones motorized table for $369.
The Stir Kinetic costs $3,890, plus tax and $299 for shipping.
So if you disregard the other qualities of the desk  and the white-glove delivery service , you re paying more than $2,000 for its smarts, which do the same thing as any number of free timer apps.
A standing desk isn t going to do you any good on its own, says Alan Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University.
What helps is moving around a lot and switching positions.
Hedge says.
So the $2,000 question here is whether you have the willpower and presence of mind to do that without a smart desk reminding you and helping you track your behavior.
I used the Stir for a week, and the benefits of the sit-stand regime were pretty obvious.
I felt more alert at work and less tired at the end of each day.
I m less sure about the benefit of the reminders.
They tended to come at the wrong times.
Bloated with lunch, I didn t want to stand up.
When on a roll, I didn t want to sit down.
The Stir is supposed to learn your habits, much like the Nest.
But it takes four weeks for it to get your measure and start to use that knowledge to time its prompts.
As I had it for only a week, I couldn t test this feature.
I was, of course, popular in the office that week.
Everyone came by to look at the fancy new desk with its shiny, Apple-like white acrylic top.
I was happy to demonstrate its features, which include USB and traditional AC power outlets hidden under lids.
There s plenty of space to hide your laptop power brick under these lids, too.
Through the touch screen, you can connect the desk to Wi-Fi so it can download software updates.
All in all, it was a very pleasant experience.
The worst I can say is that the touch screen is fairly sensitive and reacts not just to finger touches, but also to random objects landing on it.
If a book, phone or pen edges on to the screen, it can start the desk surface moving.
The company says it shouldn t be happening.
My remedy was to lock the screen by swiping down.
This adds the extra step of unlocking it when you want to change positions.
But the question remains in my mind: Would I feel just as good with a $1,500 sit-stand desk that doesn t remind me to move?
If money is no object, by all means get the Stir.
But there s quite a bit happening in the world of sit-stand desks, as evidenced by the recent Kickstarter campaign.
It wouldn t surprise me if desks that are cheaper, but just as capable, are just around the corner.

A number of open questions remain regarding the role of low-level jets  LLJs  and nocturnal mixing processes in the buildup of tropospheric ozone.
S.
Southern Great Plains during summer makes this region an ideal site for investigating the structure of the nocturnal boundary layer and its impacts on urban air quality.
Ozone \  \mathrm{O}_{3} \  and nitrogen oxide concentrations measured at regulatory monitoring sites in the Oklahoma City  OKC  area and simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry  WRF Chem  model were analyzed to show how the nocturnal LLJ moderates boundary-layer mixing processes and air quality.
Datasets collected during the Joint Urban 2003 campaign, which took place in July 2003 in OKC, provided detailed information about nocturnal boundary-layer structure and dynamics.
In general, \ {\mathrm{O}_{3}}\  time series show the expected behavior that urban \ {\mathrm{O}_{3}}\  concentrations decrease at night due to nitrogen oxide titration reactions, but elevated \ {\mathrm{O}_{3}}\  concentrations and secondary \ {\mathrm{O}_{3}}\  peaks are also seen quite frequently after sunset.
LLJs developed on most nights during the study period and were associated with strong vertical wind shear, which affected the boundary-layer stability and structure.
Near-surface \ {\mathrm{O}_{3}}\  concentrations are higher during less stable nights when active mixing persists throughout the night.
The WRF Chem model results agree well with the observations and further demonstrate the role of LLJs in moderating nocturnal mixing processes and air quality.
The highest nocturnal \ {\mathrm{O}_{3}}\  concentrations are linked to a strong LLJ that promotes both nocturnal long-range transport and persistent downward mixing of \ {\mathrm{O}_{3}}\  from the residual layer to the surface.

ABSTRACT: An examination of various United States pressure groups  messages regarding  how to inﬂuence or censor library collection content.
Looks at the beliefs and goals of  several different groups that have web presences and who wish to challenge and  change the material holdings, collection development and Internet policies of school and  public libraries.
Describes what libraries can do to resist attempts of control and censorship by these groups and how libraries can maintain intellectual freedom standards and  First Amendment rights for their library patrons.
A l’autre extrême, on trouve des partisans de la protection des enfants qui  mettent en accusation la position de l’ALA.
Dan Kleinman et son site safelibraries  constituent, à notre sens, une des incarnations les plus caricaturales de cette  branche.
Le site recense tous les cas où des mineurs ont pu être exposés à des  contenus inappropriés à leur âge dans l’enceinte d’une bibliothèque.
L’ALA est sa  cible principale en tant qu’organisation « Terrorist Friendly, Child Unfriendly, and  Dishonest »221.
Des témoignages et analyses viennent étayer les thèses les plus  folles selon lesquelles l’ALA est un Croque-mitaine car elle refuse l’application de  filtres sur les postes internet : « Il est temps que quelqu’un assigne de nouveau  l’ALA en justice pour complicité d’agression sur mineur dans une bibliothèque.

For any who are interested, here s what I ve found.
I was looking to find.
It presents such a strong anti-ALA stance that I feel we should all know about it to form an articulate response to why we do or do not support ALA and why we do or do not support Safe Libraries.
It s more complex than it seems.
Nobody would argue against keeping kids safe from porn or molestation.
However, is the ALA really responsible for such crimes?
To hear Safe Libraries tell it, it is.
Head shake    As librarians and school employees, I believe we need to know about these organizations for better or for worse.
American Library Association is exposing America s children to harmful library materials and pornography.
These websites seek to inform parents of the dangers of allowing their children unsupervised access to library materials and to fight for the removal of all questionable materials from availability to any library patron.

Self-described gay activist Kevin DuJan and Megan Fox, who co-host a conservative political blog, took a tag-team approach.
DuJan criticized the board s unwillingness at its November meeting to allow an  expert  to rebut -- via a Skype connection -- an American Library Association representative s comments supporting unrestricted access.
He cites a 2003 Supreme Court ruling that he said allows libraries to ban pornography without fear of a lawsuit.
No library has ever been sued because someone said,  You blocked my pornography,   Kleinman said.   It has never happened.

Note, my appearance on the page is only as one of the  75.   Basically, full frontal nudity is coming to a library near you.
To the ACLU, this fight isn t about porn.
The problem is filters.
Mankind can pack 1,000 songs onto a cell phone, but has not yet invented an Internet filter that blocks pornography without blocking many reproductive rights, LGBT, and teen suicide prevention websites.
Kleinman argues that people who run into unintentional blocks can simply ask a librarian to lift the filter.
Pornographic Required Reading in Knox Schools?
Wes Hall, The Knoxville Journal, 9 March 2012, where article says,  Out of 216 pages there are 281 occurrences of such words Seal considers inappropriate for any 15-year-old,  that number comes directly from me .
Dan Kleinman, a self-described library watchdog who runs a blog called Safe Libraries, agreed that books should not be removed simply because of their topics.
Sonnie replied the book had only received two challenges, including one in a Texas juvenile hall prison facility where the book was removed for its sexual content.
Sonnie said they informed her it was made  the list because unlike other books that were simply challenged, her book was actually removed.
Interestingly, the title of the same article as eventually printed and as pictured at right deletes  Selection  and puts the onus on  Parents :  Schools Once Again Face Bind Over Censorship vs. Book Lists; Pressure from Parents, Boards a Rite of Fall Season.   See cover pictured at right.
The pressure is really from the ALA to force schools to accept material they would otherwise not select without such pressure, yet the title change deletes  selection  and adds  pressure from parents.   Do you see the spin evident in the title change?
There is intense debate over whether those challenges involve censorship or are just parents seeking age-appropriate reading material.

Jim Walsh, Courier Post, 20 August 2010.
Dan Kleinman, a Morris County-based  safe library  activist who backs  Sweet s decision, said the protesters were well-intended but mistaken.
Dan Kleinman, a New Jersey resident who operates a blog                and Web site that focuses on national library association   policies              that he says put questionable material in the   hands of young people,              said Cheshire residents   seeking to ban the book would be better served              working   toward changing the library s policies, which Harten said                don t permit the Library Board or any of the town s elected leaders                to overrule her decision.
Kleinman               said.
It is wrong to say  children  should              not have books because there s witchcraft  in them.
AFP, referring to some  of the  arguments put forward by religious              fundamentalists.
Kleinman, whose website is a clearing              house for information about challenging books,   insists              that he does not want to see books banned, but   says there is a legitimate              legal basis for restricting   children s access to sexually explicit              material in   libraries.

Organizers of efforts to have books removed from public libraries or school reading lists say that their efforts are aimed at keeping graphic material, such as obscene language or sex scenes, out of the hands of young children.
Banned Books Week is  propaganda to convince parents to allow school boards and libraries to continue making inappropriate material available,  he said.
Kleinman cited the decision by the school board in Oak Lawn, a Chicago suburb, to keep a book on a summer reading list for eighth-graders despite its use of profanity and description of adolescent sexual desires.

Or there was the man who was stabbed at the Brooklyn Public Library by someone accusing him of watching Internet porn.
If only there had been porn filters!
And maybe some body armor.
But there s not a lot to say about that either, especially since Safe Libraries Guy was nowhere near the BPL.
Stabbing people is bad.
Don’t do it.
Get well soon.
That s pretty much it.
American Library Association, Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom, LX:3  May 2011 .
Finally, the influence of outside lobbying groups on local Internet filtering policies in libraries should not be understated.
Internet filters into local school and public libraries.
These groups can provide local politicians in their like-minded political party with template proposals for Internet filtering ballot measures, city council resolutions, policy changes, and so on.
This often provides the politician, in his or her mind, with a clear winning platform for the next election.
These prewritten policy-change templates require the politician to insert only his or her city, school, or county name.
With such an easily presented fast lane to election supremacy, libraries and intellectual freedom advocates must stand vigilant and constantly remind politicians that their constituents include people who believe in the right of choice, not only people who believe in their right to remove everyone else s choice.

Most challenges are brought by parents and grandparents, or adult community members who happen to stumble on a book in the library, Caldwell-Stone said, but there are also organized groups, using names like  family friendly,   citizens for decency,  or  safe libraries.     say they are there to protect kids, that they are there to protect parents  rights to raise their kids the way they see fit, and they think this gives them the right to dictate what is in the library,  she said.

Guess Who Is Back?
Teri Lesesne  Professor Nana , The Goddess of YA Literature, 11 October 2014.
This is a very mean attack by her.
False, of course.
I will respond in a separate post as she keeps censoring my comments.
Here Ya Go!
Teri Lesesne  Professor Nana , The Goddess of YA Literature, 9 October 2014.
This is her response to her previous censorship of days ago.
Naturally, my response has again been blocked.
Terrific, may I comment now?
Booktoss said I used  conspiracy theory rhetoric.   Where?
I discuss sexual harassment of librarians and the potential for complicity by ALA s OIF.
There is a big problem with sexual harassment within the ranks of librarians and the library profession.
I report that ALA OIF is poo pooing claims of sexual.
The response is to attack me for reporting that.
And you are not the only ones.
I supported Amanda Goodman for speaking out on sexual harassment and Stephen Francouer responded by saying librarians can t let Dan Kleinman be the only support for Amanda, as if silencing me takes precedence over supporting sexual harassed librarians.
ALA OIF itself responded to me via that statement where it said sexual harassment of librarians essentially never happens.
I provide a link below so you can see this for yourselves, see ALA OIF Deborah Caldwell-Stone speaking on the issue, saying it really hardly ever exists.
So here I am speaking out about the issue of sexual harassment within librarianship for longer than anyone and I get attacked for it.
Don t let Dan speak out.
He s uses  conspiracy theory rhetoric.   Library Journal absolutely never says word one about the topic except to call it  poppycock.   American Libraries never discusses it.
The few people who do, like myself and the sexually harassed librarians themselves, are ignored.
Heck even #TeamHarpy is being attacked for speaking out by some.
The only time ALA paid attention to me publicly was when Rory Litwin interviewed me in a weird way in which he kept digging to find out why I oppose ALA OIF and that it must be due to -- sexual harassment he imagined I must have experienced when I was young.
Sexual harassment is not only ignored within the library profession, but the idea of it is used as the means to smear those trying to expose it!
Gee, is it any wonder there s a problem with sexual harassment in librarianship?
People mock it.
Leadership says it doesn t exist.
Library media jokes about it or simply ignores it.
What did one of #teamharpy just say?
ByShieldMaiden: @Talen_Lee We accept the support of anyone who is against sexism, harassment, oppression, and silencing.
That includes me.
On the other hand, there s Professor Nana and booktoss.
On the other hand there s ALA OIF s Deborah Caldwell-Stone who, in response to me, tells a local library at its trustee meeting that sexual harassment of librarians hardly ever happens because the rules are so stringent, and times when it did happen it really didn t happen.
Skipping to beginning of speech by ALA OIF Deborah Caldwell-Stone, Esq.
Professor Nana, as long as you continue to mock me instead of including me as one of the voices speaking out against sexism, harassment, oppression, and silencing, you are part of the problem.
Thanks for writing about me.
I see you are  annoyed.  Are you the Annoyed Librarian?
You have misrepresented me and ascribed words to me I did not say.
Had you spoken with me I could have set you right.
I am certain you do not wish to intentionally mislead your readers.
I haven t updated it in many years.
People are allowed to improve, right?
The quote you cited on the main page was not mine.
The quote on the Porn Pushers page is mine, but without context, I d have to agree with you that it s a gem.
The PABBIS site is not mine and it is even older.
My SafeLibraries blog is updated regularly.
It references reliable sources, such as Judith Krug saying in the rare instance a book does not meet a school s selection policy,  get it out of there.  I am not aware that it violates copyright, but I suspect you mainly had the PABBIS site in mind since it provides multiple, extensive excerpts.
I don t do that.
Professor Nana, how would you like to speak with me directly about your concerns?
Then you can report more accurately on the topic.
Overarching all, however, is the actions of ALA that I report, not that people don t like that I report it or how I report it.
For example, #TeamHarpy is now discussing sexual harassment of librarians.
Great!
I have been speaking about that topic for many years but ears close because of my connecting the dots showing sexual harassment of librarians can be laid directly at the feet of ALA s Office for Intellectual Freedom and its pro child pronography policy.
In reality, sexual harassment of librarians can be laid directly at the feet of ALA s Office for Intellectual Freedom.
I report on it.
ALA does not.
Indeed, OIF s Deborah Caldwell-Stone recently said, mainly in response to me, sexual harassment of librarians almost never happens .
I m happy #TeamHarpy is discussing sexual harassment of librarians, but I have been discussing it for years, people like you attack the messenger, and OIF to this day makes light of sexual harassment of librarians.
Have you helped anyone by mocking silencing a whistleblower?
Professor Nana, who is the real problem here?
The inartful reporter, as you may view me, or the powerful ALA OIF in a position to exacerbate the sexual harassment of librarians by claiming it almost never happens so not filtering child pronography may continue unabated?
And that s just one example.

Good Faith ,  by Stephen Bertrand, She Said He Said  Kankakee Public Library , 23 October 2007.  This was in response to my comment on the previous library blog post entitled,   Is the ALA Out of Touch?
Contains a letter from ALA s Deborah Caldwell-Stone discussing what I said in the Chicago Tribune but not mentioning me by name.
You can quote me on that].
Like the Annoyed Librarian says, the ALA s freedom of speech is the freedom to speak and think like them.
All else are cut off.
My point has not been lost as the content has now been removed.
I ll have no need or desire to ever engage again with that group.
Done deal.
Why are you still sending e-mails to me on civil discourse?
How has it transpired that my opposition to the crude and illegal fellatio uploads  now turns on the false fulcrum of my lack of  civility  and not upon a focus of the heterosexual male prerogative  which considered it suitable to penetrate and push pass the boundaries of professionalism in such a way?
I would not deign to upload a cunnilingus graphic on ALAConnect.
Why?
Because there should be boundaries.
My private propensities are mine alone - and those with whom I share particular pleasures.
The selfsame dynamic evidenced on ALAConnect is what has been now forced before the Bench and Bar.
The Library Foundations are now party to the suits as enablers and facilitators; those mandated with representing the interests of the library workers are defendants, not plaintiffs.
Now, you might say that it is I who am exaggerating the sinister intent and power of organizations like those represented by Mr.
Kleinman.
If so, just check the election results for 2000, 2002, and 2004 and consider the narrow margins by which the presidency and other offices have been won in  battleground  states like Florida, Ohio and  yes  Missouri.
Since I have now had a request for an interview from Dan Kleinman of SafeLibraries,  I am more convinced that Councilor Rosenzweig may indeed be right about the ideological conspiracy although I am sure that this incident  is far more complicated than that, but SafeLibraries is a smear of major proportions.
I responded to Mr.
Mr.
You have a right to your opinion, but I’m not interested in being a part of your destructive and misguided zealotry.
Now more than ever.

For an organization that constantly preaches about openess in government  and an organization that receives government funding , they seem to be incapable of being the least bit open themselves.
Remember folks, this is the very same library that broke its own rules to allow two representatives from the pro-porn ALA to speak in November on their behalf but then refused in December to bring a laptop into the room so that Kleinman  who is arguably the best legal expert on porn in libraries in the country as acknowledged by CIPA author Ernest Istook who called him a  trusted source   could refute the ALA’s particular brand of noxious lies.
There is no one more well-versed in the ALA s tactics, lies, intimidation techniques, and actual court cases involving pornography in libraries than Kleinman; refusing him the right to speak on behalf of children and parents who don t want porn in libraries is nothing less than willful deceit of the public on behalf of the OPPL.

Sean O Connor, Chicago Libraries Examiner, 6 November 2013.
First Amendment right to do so despite what the US Supreme Court said.
If you are a library that allows porn viewing, you are contributing to the further persecution of sex crime victims.
The video is clearly promoting an end to illegal immigration enforcement, to usher in an era of open borders.
The bottom line is this.
The ALA did not respond to a WND request for comment.
The issue is not gay penguins.
The problem has nothing to do with WorldNetDaily.
Here s the problem.
The American Library Association is faking its annual top 10 challenged book list to promote its own political purposes.
Here s the evidence.
One of the authors on the list unwittingly admitted that, essentially, the ALA faked the list to promote her book over others that were actually challenged more often.
Further, despite the ALA announcement saying the top book, the one about the penguins, was challenged dozens of times, in truth it was challenged 4 times all year.
The proof.
I have a recording of the author stating essentially the ALA faked the list.
And I myself spoke with the very ALA guy who compiled the list, and I think the number 4 has been confirmed elsewhere.
My view.
Four times is not such a big deal.
Saying it was challenged dozens of times is deceptive, however.
Put that together with the unwitting admission of the author, in response to a question I asked, and anyone being honest could come to the conclusion that the ALA has faked its top 10 list.
Now I know little about Wonkette, but I can see WorldNetDaily has been unfairly ridiculed here, and what has been overlooked is that the ALA fakes its yearly top 10 challenged book list.
That s the news here, not WorldNetDaily.
And that news is backed up with solid evidence, including the very words of a listed author admitting the ALA explained why her book was on the list, and it was for political purposes.
Takeaway.
The ALA s faked list is not authoritative and schools using it as guidance should stop doing so.
The only other challenges that I m aware of are these two, and I talked to the ALA Office of Intellectual Freedom about it.

Nancy explained the revision to the policy which basically is that the computers will have filters on at all times and if a patron wants to have access to a site that they need unblocked for research purposes they will have to fill out a request form, including the website they want to view.
The library will have 72 hours to respond.
The librarians have every right to say no if someone want to access sexually explicit material.
Patrons may also ask for certain sites to be blocked if they deem them inappropriate.
Dan Kleinman.
A] move fully supported by  Dan Kleinman , a library watchdog who encourages concerned citizens to challenge any book they feel uncomfortable with in their local library and teaches his audience methods to oppose the American Library Association.
I advise communities that they are being intentionally misled by the American Library Association.
Some communities react by purging the negative influence of the ALA.
This point of view gives us some great food for thought about what it means to be banned and or challenged.

Right Hon.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Ms.
We—the undersigned—are women who work in different capacities to end violence against women and to protect and advance women’s rights to equality.
Prostitution is a practice in which women’s subordination to men is inherent and lived out repeatedly.
Consequently, we are writing to you today to urge you to support the “Nordic approach” to legislation on prostitution for Canada, because it includes legislation, intensive social supports, and public education strategies, all designed to reduce and eliminate prostitution.
We are aware of the March 27 open letter from the Gender and Sexual Health Initiative at the University of British Columbia  GSHI , which calls for decriminalization of all aspects of prostitution, including buyers and profiteers, on the grounds that this is the only “evidence‑based” policy option.
The list of signatories implies that only those with formal credentials can “research” or interpret evidence.
We reject both of these premises.
Evidence about the harms of prostitution is gathered by academic researchers, survivors of prostitution and those working on the front-line.
That evidence proves that prostitution is violence against women.
This is not only a dispute about evidence; it is a dispute about goals and principles, and legislators will have to decide carefully which principles they wish to uphold, and which goals they wish to pursue, for women in Canada.
The evidence in the same studies and government reports cited in the GHSI letter supports intensive efforts, worldwide, to reduce and eliminate prostitution.
1] Merely attempting to reduce the ancillary dangers of prostitution is an inadequate, and in our view, discriminatory strategy.
We believe that prostitution constitutes violence against women because it is a practice of subordination and exploitation that is gendered, raced, and classed; that, as the Supreme Court of Canada found in Bedford, most women cannot be said to choose prostitution, and consequently, in the experience of women, any line between prostitution, trafficking and child prostitution is more artificial than real.
Therefore, we believe that a strategy that affirms the human dignity of women and girls is essential and the only approach consistent with Canada’s principles of equality.
Prostitution is a social institution that both manifests and embeds the inequality between women and men, perpetuating women’s subordination to men, and their status as sexual commodities for men’s use.
In Canada, as elsewhere, men are overwhelmingly buyers and women are the ones being sold.
It is not sufficient in the face of these facts to take an approach that might merely reduce the harms that surround prostitution, when prostitution itself is a reinforcement of women’s subordination.
Further, the evidence is clear, including in affidavits filed by both the claimants and the defendants in the Bedford case, that women enter into prostitution because of economic need and profound social disadvantage.
As it makes no sense to penalize women for their sexual, social, and economic inequality, we endorse the legislative approach of the Nordic model, that is, to decriminalize those—usually women— who are being bought and sold, but to apply criminal sanctions to buyers, pimps, and those who profit from the sale of women’s bodies.
The criminal law by itself is not a solution to the inequality problem that prostitution represents, but it is essential, in our view, that the criminal law convey a clear message about women’s equality in Canada: in this case, the message that men’s purchase of sex is an egregious and impermissible violation of equality rights.
Who is in Prostitution?
Most women in prostitution in Canada are there because of poverty, homelessness, addictions, lack of social supports, racism, and the many harsh impacts of colonialism on Aboriginal communities and families.
Aboriginal women and girls are disproportionately represented in street prostitution and among women in prostitution who have been murdered.
Many women enter prostitution as children; many have histories of child sexual abuse.
Most say they would leave prostitution if they could.
These are well‑established facts.
Prostitution is evidence of, and entrenches, sex, race, and class hierarchies.
Prostitution for poor, racialized women in Canada cannot be called liberty.
The Native Women’s Association of Canada  NWAC  has made a public call for help to stop the buying and pimping of Aboriginal women, and to stop the poverty and abuse that funnels them into prostitution.
The Asian Women Coalition Ending Prostitution  AWCEP  makes the same call.
We support NWAC and AWCEP and join our voices to theirs.
Well‑designed interventions by Canada’s governments, with long‑term commitments to address the social and economic disadvantage of women and girls, and particularly of Aboriginal and other racialized women and girls, will be needed, not just piecemeal short‑term exit services, drop‑in centers, or safe houses.
Creating conditions that minimize the risk of women entering prostitution, and genuinely helping them to leave it, requires providing women and girls with adequate alternative sources of income, including social assistance sufficient to meet basic needs, adequate housing, access to all levels of education, decent work, child care, and counseling, addiction, and mental health services.
On this point too we find the Nordic model helpful, because it is clear that criminal law, by itself, is not a sufficient solution to the profound inequality that prostitution represents.
Genuine programmatic and budgetary commitments by governments are also necessary to address the deeply rooted social and economic disadvantages of women and the history of sexism, racism, and colonialism that underlie prostitution.
Legalizing or decriminalizing prostitution has been tried in the Netherlands, Germany, the state of Nevada, some states in Australia, and New Zealand.
Such an approach means that governments and societies accept that there is an underclass of women  defined by some combination of poverty, race and addiction  who can continue to be exploited in prostitution, even though prostitution is inherently an institution of sex inequality and violence.
We do not agree that prostitution is acceptable for any women, or that the goal of equality between women and men can be abandoned for some women.
The Native Women’s Association of Canada  NWAC  flatly rejects the prospect of indoor prostitution in legalized brothels as an advance for Aboriginal women and girls.
They point out that Aboriginal women and girls who are in street prostitution are unlikely to move indoors because poverty and racism keep them in the most dangerous forms of prostitution.
Even if this were not the case, NWAC finds that, over time, Aboriginal women and girls have been shifted from institution to institution by settler governments—residential schools, group homes, prisons.
The brothel appears to be the most recent institution that is considered better and safer for Aboriginal women.
But this is not equality for Aboriginal women and girls.
As AWCEP knows from the experience of its members, indoor prostitution is no answer; it merely puts hard walls around the inequality of poor and racialized women, and leaves it unchanged.
We believe that this is a wrong approach: men must be held accountable when they subordinate and exploit women.
Equality for women cannot be achieved in Canada if we are unwilling to engage with the cruel reality that men exploit women in prostitution.
5] The violence inherent in prostitution is accepted by legalization, and the violence regularly associated with prostitution does not disappear.
In addition, what is legalized and normalized is not just individual prostitution transactions, but the prostitution industry.
It not only becomes legal for individual men to purchase access to women’s bodies, but also legal to own and run a business that sells access to women’s bodies, or for employers in isolated work locations to provide men access to women for sex as an aspect of employment.
For Canada to take this step would be both dangerous and discriminatory.
Where Should Canada Stand?
Canada has a history of commitment to women’s equality, to racial equality, and to vigorous social programs as a means of creating a more egalitarian society in which the basic needs of all Canadians are met.
In addition the rights of Aboriginal peoples, and of Aboriginal women to live free from violence, are set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, recently endorsed by Canada.
Consistent with Canada’s long‑standing commitments to equality, we urge you now to support a Nordic‑model approach to new legislative, programmatic, and public education strategies to reduce and eliminate prostitution in Canada.
We do not accept prostitution as a solution to women’s poverty; we want something much better for Canada’s poor and racialized women and girls.
We believe you do too, and we urge you to act on your commitments to women and to an egalitarian Canada.

World Development, vol.

I guess Canada has also ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime and its Protocols?
It should be clear that legalisation decriminalization of prostitution normalises buying sex and thus increases demand.
To meet the supply, trafficking increases.
Isn’t decriminalization thus in contradiction with the Palermo Protocol?
That would suggest an element of logical thinking around reality rather than opinion posing as reality such as the sex industry promotes.
Thought the exposure of the implication that only the pro sex trafficking lobby has the right to call their research ‘evidenced’ was really to the point too, am so fed up of pro trafficking slavery trying to pull a constant fast one over everyone’s heads by their refusal to acknowledge that legalising demand feeds slavery.
The sex industry lobby’s push to normalize the idea that prostitution is equivalent to sex between consenting adults and just a benign business transaction is a dangerous lie.
With dire consequence for the most disadvantaged women on the planet.
Animals”, are you serious?
Not that I would be surprised to hear about sexual libertarians promoting bestiality, after all people are really critical of it so it must be the height of “transgression” and “sexual boundary pushing” and therefore a good thing, right?
At least that’s what they would have us believe.
I suspect that a lot of the “sexual boundaries” libertarians want to destroy are either there for a good reason or they were set up by women for women or both.
They may accuse other people of characterising humanity as brainwashed, but they sure seem to be under the impression that any woman who disagrees with them has internalised “sex negativity” from the culture.
Even if we grant that the culture contains “sex negativity” there is way less “sex negativity”  in mainstream culture  than there is promotion of gender conformity and yet they insist that it is wrong to argue that women are indoctrinated into femininity.
Sexual libertarianism has more inconsistancies that a fantasy novel.
I say animals because there is a fair amount of bestiality on line now in porn … Which is a totally against the notion of its all consensual … How can a sheep or dog consent to sex with a human?
Agreed.
Prostitution is not about sex, it is about domination and control.
It’s not sex, it’s abuse.
Meghan, is there a French-language version of this letter?
