Second inauguration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg on the steps of City Hall, 2006.
The Mayor of the City of New York is head of the executive branch of New York City s government .
The mayor  s office administers all city services, public property, police and fire protection, most public agencies, and enforces all city and state laws within New York City .
The budget overseen by the mayor s office is the largest municipal budget in the United States at $70 billion a year.
1 million students  the largest public school system in the United States , levies $27 billion in taxes, and receives $14 billion from the state and federal governments.
The mayor s office is located in New York City Hall ; it has jurisdiction over all five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan , Brooklyn , the Bronx , Queens , and Staten Island .
The mayor appoints a large number of officials, including commissioners who head city departments, and his or her deputy mayors.
According to current law, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms in office.
It was changed from two to three terms on October 23, 2008, when the New York City Council voted 29–22 in favor of passing the term limit extension into law.
2] However, in 2010, there was a referendum, reverting the limit to two terms, which passed overwhelmingly.
In 1665, Governor Richard Nicolls appointed Thomas Willett as the first mayor of New York.
For 156 years, the mayor was appointed and had limited power.
Between 1783 and 1821 the mayor was appointed by the Council of Appointments in which the state s governor had the loudest voice.
In 1821, the Common Council, which included elected members, gained the authority to choose the mayor.
An amendment to the New York State Constitution in 1834 provided for the direct popular election of the mayor.
Cornelius W.
Lawrence , a Democrat , was elected that year.
Gracie Mansion has been the official residence of the mayor since Fiorello La Guardia  s administration in 1942.
Its main floor is open to the public and serves as a small museum.
The mayor is entitled to a salary of $ 225,000,  but early 21st century mayor Michael Bloomberg , the 16th-richest  man in the world, declined the salary and instead was paid $1 yearly.
Bloomberg had an estimated net worth of $33 billion as of 2014.
In 2000, direct control of the city s public school system was transferred to the mayor s office.
In 2003, the reorganization established the New York City Department of Education .
Tammany Hall revolves around Boss Croker in this 1899 cartoon in Puck .
Tammany Hall, which evolved from an organization of craftsmen into a Democratic political machine, gained control of Democratic Party nominations in the state and city in 1861.
It played a major role in New York City politics into the 1960s, and was a dominant player from the mayoral victory of Fernando Wood in 1854 through the era of Robert Wagner  1954–1965 .
The Mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to assist him and to oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government.
The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter.
The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia  who appointed Grover Whalen as deputy mayor  to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend.
Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor.
There are currently seven deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor.
Deputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor  the order of succession is the city s public advocate, then the comptroller .

The New York City mayoralty has played a central role in several films and television series.
Spin City  1996–2002 , set in City Hall, it cast Barry Bostwick as the dim-witted mayor, but starred Michael J.
Fox as a deputy mayor, whose primary task was to keep the mayor from embarrassing himself in front of the media and voters.
City Hall  1996  starred Al Pacino as an idealistic mayor and John Cusack as his deputy mayor, who leads an investigation with unexpectedly far-reaching consequences into the accidental shooting of a boy in New York.
The Taking of Pelham One Two Three  1974  features Lee Wallace as an indecisive, flu-struck mayor who is bullied by his deputy and booed by the citizenry.
The comic-book series Ex Machina posits an alternate history in which the 2001 election is won by the independent Mitchell Hundred, a former superhero called the Great Machine, who sweeps to victory after saving the second tower of the World Trade Center on September 11 .
A fictional mayor is also featured in the 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series .
Local tabloid newspapers often refer to the mayor as  Hizzoner , a corruption of the title   His Honor  .
Several mayors have appeared in television and movies, as well as on Broadway—most notably in The Will Rogers Follies .
In the 1980s and 90s, Mayors Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani had appeared on Saturday Night Live on several occasions, sometimes mocking themselves in sketches.
Giuliani and Bloomberg have both appeared, as themselves in their mayoral capacities, on episodes of Law & Order .
Giuliani also appeared as himself in an episode of Seinfeld .
Giuliani has made cameos in films such as The Out-of-Towners and Anger Management .
Bloomberg has appeared on 30 Rock and Curb Your Enthusiasm .

Mayor Bill de Blasio is the 109th Mayor of New York City.
From his early days as a young City Hall staffer, to serving on his local school board, to his most recent position as Public Advocate for the City of New York, Bill de Blasio has spent his life fighting to ensure that every New Yorker - in every neighborhood throughout our five boroughs - gets a fair shot.

For a list of the Mayors of Brooklyn from 1834 to Brooklyn s consolidation into the City of New York in 1898, see History of Brooklyn .
This list includes mayors who governed the city of New York at times when its territory was smaller than it is today.
Before 1874, the city covered little or no land beyond the island of Manhattan , but later annexed territory in the area that formed the Borough of the Bronx in 1898.
The city s consolidation in 1898 defined the current boundaries of the five boroughs : Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island .
See History of New York City .
The current Mayor of New York City,  and 109th in the sequence of regular mayors , is Bill de Blasio , a Democrat .
During the Dutch colonial period from 1625 to 1664, New Amsterdam was governed by a Director-General .
For the year prior to the establishment of the office of Mayor of New York in 1665, New York was run by Richard Nicolls , who was the British military governor of the Province of New York .
Thomas Willett was the first person to be specifically appointed mayor.
Mayors were appointed by provincial governors until 1777 when a Council of Appointment was formed by New York State.
In 1821 the New York City Council – then known as the Common Council – began appointing mayors.
Since 1834 mayors have been elected by direct popular vote.
The longest-serving mayors so far have been Fiorello H.
La Guardia  1934–1945 , Robert F.
Wagner, Jr.
1954–1965 , Edward I.
Koch  1978–1989 , and Michael Bloomberg  2002–2013  each of whom was in office for twelve years  three successive 4-year terms .
The shortest terms in office since 1834 have been those of acting mayors Thomas Coman  five weeks from Monday, November 30, 1868, to Monday, January 4, 1869  and Samuel B.
H.
Vance  one month from November 30 to December 31, 1874 .
Although being Mayor of New York City has been described as the  second toughest job in America  after the Presidency ,  and although several mayors – most recently John Lindsay and Rudolph Giuliani – have sought the Presidency, no one person has yet held both positions.
Indeed no sitting or former mayor has been elected to another public office since Ardolph Loges Kline  acting mayor in late 1913  was re-elected Alderman in 1913 and later elected in 1920 to his only term in Congress.
Neither has any mayor so far  out of more than a hundred  been female, nor has any except David Dinkins been non-white.
Before 1680, mayors served one-year terms.
As of 1680, they served two-year terms.
Exceptions are noted thus  * .
A dagger  †  indicates mayoralties cut short by death in office.
After 1820, the mayor was appointed by the city s Common Council .
Peter Delanoy  1689–1691  was the only mayor elected by popular vote before 1834.
See Note 1 directly below this table .
Peter Delanoy was the first and only directly-elected mayor of New York  until 1834.
Appointed mayors resumed in the wake of Leisler s Rebellion .
Under the Charter of 1834, mayors were elected annually.
After 1849, they served two-year terms.
John T.
Hoffman resigned after his election as Governor of New York state but before the end of his mayoral term.
Thomas Coman , President of the Board of Aldermen, completed Hoffman s term as acting Mayor until his elected successor, A.
Oakey Hall , took office.
William F.
Havemeyer died during his last term of office.
Samuel B.
H.
Vance , President of the Board of Aldermen, completed Havemeyer s term as acting Mayor until his elected successor, William H.
Wickham took office.
The 1898–1901 term was for four years.
The Charter was changed to make the Mayor s term a two-year one beginning in 1902, but after two such terms was changed back to resume four-year terms in 1906.
George B.
McClellan, Jr.
1904 to 1905, during which he was elected to a four-year term from 1906 to 1909.
See New York City mayoral elections#Terms and term limits  since 1834  .
Ardolph L.
Kline , the unelected President of the Board of Aldermen , succeeded as acting Mayor upon William Gaynor s death, but then sought re-election as an Alderman  successfully  rather than election as Mayor.
Kline has thus been the only mayor since 1834 never to win a city-wide election  having been appointed Vice President of the Board of Aldermen by his colleagues and then succeeding to the Presidency mid-term, rather than winning it by popular election at large .
James J.
Walker resigned September 1, 1932 and went to Europe, amid allegations of corruption in his administration.
Joseph V.
McKee , as President of the Board of Aldermen, became Acting Mayor in Walker s place, but was then defeated in a special election by John P.
O Brien .
William O Dwyer resigned August 31, 1950, during a police corruption scandal, after which he was appointed Ambassador to Mexico by President Harry S.
Truman .
Vincent R.
Impellitteri , President of the New York City Council , became Acting Mayor when O Dwyer resigned on August 31, 1950, and was then elected to the office in a special election held on November 7, 1950.
He was inaugurated on November 14.
As of January 2014  , the three living former mayors were also the three who had served most recently.
The most recent former mayor to die—on February 1, 2013—was their immediate predecessor, Ed Koch  who was born in December 1924 and served from 1978 to 1989 .

When a former mayor serves again after a break in office, a new number is assigned to his resumed service.
However, the five acting mayoralties are unnumbered.

Mayor Bill de Blasio is the 109th Mayor of New York City.
From his early days as a young City Hall staffer, to serving on his local school board, to his most recent position as Public Advocate for the City of New York, Bill de Blasio has spent his life fighting to ensure that every New Yorker - in every neighborhood throughout our five boroughs - gets a fair shot.
Together with his wife Chirlane, Bill is the proud parent of Chiara, a college sophomore, and Dante, a high school junior.
Having raised their children in Brooklyn and sent them to New York City public schools, Bill and Chirlane understand firsthand the fundamental role parents and teachers share in educating the next generation - and of the importance of providing equal educational opportunities in all neighborhoods.
After graduating from NYU, Bill studied at Columbia University s School of International and Public Affairs.
He began his career in public service as a junior staffer for New York City s first African-American mayor, David N.
Dinkins, and later became an assistant for community affairs at City Hall.
S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, working as Regional Director under then-Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, as New York and New Jersey s highest-ranking official in the department.
At HUD, he crisscrossed the Tri-State region, gaining a critical understanding of the diverse communities that make up the New York metropolitan area.
As regional director, Bill fought for increased federal funding for affordable homes and expanded housing services for senior citizens.
In 1999, Bill joined District 15 s School Board in Brooklyn, where he championed early childhood education and parental involvement and expanded pre-K programs, helping his district become the first to cap first grade class sizes.
S.
Senate.
Working at the head of a vast grassroots operation, he helped re-introduce Mrs.
Clinton to New Yorkers and deliver her message about prioritizing children and families, securing her a decisive victory in a highly competitive campaign.
Two years later, Bill started his service on the New York City Council, representing the diverse Brooklyn neighborhoods of Park Slope, Sunset Park, Boro Park, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Windsor Terrace, Red Hook, and Kensington.
In his eight years on the City Council, Bill focused his efforts on improving public education, engaging parents, expanding affordable housing, and protecting New York s middle-class and working poor.
He wrote landmark tenants  rights legislation to protect affordable housing and end landlord discrimination for everyday New Yorkers.
Bill also was a vocal advocate for services designed to support fragile families and vulnerable children.
After the tragic death of seven-year-old Nixzmary Brown in 2006, he investigated the case as Chair of the Council s General Welfare Committee, holding four hearings examining the City s role in fighting child abuse.
In 2010, Bill was sworn in as New York City Public Advocate, the second-highest citywide elected office.
As Public Advocate, Bill launched the  NYC Worst Landlords Watchlist  to publicly identify landlords who took advantage of everyday New Yorkers, pressing them to improve building maintenance and upkeep.
Bill made his voice heard across our city as a forceful advocate for stronger representation and services for the millions of workers who are the foundation of New York City s economy.
As mayor, Bill is committed to making sure every child gets a great education, protecting our streets and our communities, and building a city where New Yorkers from all five boroughs can start businesses, raise their families, and afford to live in their own neighborhoods.
City of New York.
Columbia University Law School and chief judge                        of the city court, Van Wyck rose through the ranks of Tammany Hall to become the first mayor of Greater New York after                        consolidation.
In 1897, he fought a bitter campaign against                        political reformer and one time Brooklyn Mayor Seth Low.
Although Van Wyck failed to deliver a single formal speech                        during the campaign  a result of his deep disdain                        for public speaking  he prevailed over Citizens Union                        candidate Low by a margin of 80,000 votes.
Despite the historical significance                          of the occasion, Van Wyck s inauguration ceremony was                          hardly an elaborate affair.
The mayors of Manhattan, Brooklyn,                          and Long Island City, stripped of their positions by consolidation,                          joined Van Wyck on the podium.
As a crowd of spectators                          3,000 strong anxiously awaited his remarks outside City                          Hall, the new mayor uttered just two sentences.
Mr.
Mayor, the people have chosen me                          to be mayor.
Van Wyck s tenure as mayor was                          beset by administrative failures and political scandals,                          including charges he participated in an Ice Trust scam                          that artificially inflated the price of fresh milk.
In                          1899, the state legislature conducted an investigation                          into corruption in New York City, and concluded Van Wyck was a  dictator  who had  abdicated  his powers to the                          Tammany Hall bosses.
Although then Governor Theodore Roosevelt                          was petitioned to remove him from office, Van Wyck was                          able to serve out the remainder of his term.
On the inauguration                          day of his successor, Van Wyck reportedly left City Hall                          out the back and walked among the crowd outside, unrecognized.
Perhaps his greatest accomplishment                          as mayor was the awarding of the city s first subway contract,                          valued at $35,000,000.
After leaving office, Van Wyck                          amassed a small fortune as an attorney and moved to Paris                          with his wife, where he died on November 13, 1918.
Wyck s unremarkable tenure as the first mayor of Greater                        New York rejuvenated the reform movement and paved the way                        for Seth Low.
A graduate and president of Columbia University,                        former Mayor of Brooklyn and life-long activist in progressive                        politics, Low was the first mayor to be elected on a fusion                        ticket with the backing of the Republican and Citizens Union                        parties.
He delivered a brief speech upon taking the oath                        of office, vowing to  consecrate myself to the welfare of                        the people.  In stark contrast to his predecessor, Low s                        administration was perceived as honest and competent.
He                        is credited with introducing civil service and a merit system                        for hiring city employees, lowering taxes while streamlining                        government services, improving the school system, and greatly                        reducing graft in the police department.
After his defeat                        in 1903, Low remained active in politics and labor issues,                        mediating many strikes.
He believed in recognition for unions                        and the right of collective bargaining, although he favored                        arbitration over strikes.
Low died on September 17, 1916                        at his upstate New York home.
P.
Morgan and Samuel Gompers.
Civil War general who ran unsuccessfully                        for President against Abraham Lincoln, George McClellan                        had a distinguished career in politics and academia.
McClellan                        was a graduate of Princeton University, a journalist, an                        attorney, a congressman by twenty-seven, and by thirty,                        president of the New York City Board of Aldermen .
He ran on the Tammany Hall ticket                        and defeated Seth Low in 1903, at the age of thirty-seven.
Despite his affiliation with Tammany Hall, McClellan demonstrated                        a fiery independence that only gained momentum in his second                        term.
He defeated newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst                        to win reelection, but it was a bitter sweet victory, for                        McClellan was subjected to scathing attacks by Hearst s                        newspapers for the duration of his time in office.
He broke                        with Tammany Hall in his second term, cracked down on vice                        and gambling, and terminated many of the beneficiaries of                        Tammany s patronage machine.
Although he acknowledged it                        was political suicide, McClellan later told a reporter:                         There comes a time in every man s life when he must choose                        one course or another. I chose  I had to keep my self                        respect.  With a fondness for great public works  he spent his first day in office sampling the yet-to-be                        opened subway system  McClellan oversaw the construction                        of the Queensboro and Manhattan bridges, the Municipal Building,                        and the Catskill water system.
After leaving office, McClellan                        became a lecturer and a celebrated professor of Economic                        History at Princeton University, served in World War I,                        achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel, traveled extensively                        abroad, and wrote many books on Italian history.
He died                        on November 30, 1940 and was buried in Arlington National                        Cemetery.
Christian Brothers order, William Jay                        Gaynor would disappoint Tammany Hall when they nominated                        him for mayor in 1909.
Although Gaynor abandoned the Christian                        order in 1869, later becoming a crusading reporter and Brooklyn                        attorney, he retained his righteous temperament.
Elected                        to the New York Supreme Court in 1893, and appointed to                        the Appellate Division, Second Department in 1905, Gaynor s                        rulings were often cited around the country.
His reputation                        as an honest reformer helped win him election as mayor in                        1909.
On January 1, 1910, he walked                          to City Hall from his home in Brooklyn  it was the                          first time he had ever visited the seat of city government  and addressed the 1,500 people gathered to greet                          him: I enter upon this office with the intention of doing                          the very best I can for the City of New York. That will                          have to suffice; I can do no more.  Gaynor s marriage                          with Tammany Hall was short-lived; soon after taking office,                          he filled high level government posts with experts and                          city employees were chosen from civil service lists in                          the order they appeared, effectively curbing patronage                          and nepotism.
As mayor, he railed against efforts to thwart                          the further development of the New York City subway system.
A strong willed but compassionate mayor, Gaynor once remarked,                           The world does not grow better by force or by the policeman s                          club.  Early in his first term, Gaynor was shot in the                          throat by a discharged city employee, the only New York                          City mayor to suffer an assassination attempt.
Although                          he quickly recovered, the bullet remained lodged in his                          throat for the next three years.
During his term as mayor,                          Gaynor was widely considered a strong candidate for Governor                          or President.
Tammany Hall refused to nominate him for                          reelection to a second term, but after accepting the nomination                          from an independent group of voters, he set sail for Europe.
Six days later, on September 10, 1913, Gaynor died suddenly                          from the lingering effects of the shooting.
John Purroy Mitchel was the youngest                        person ever to be elected Mayor of New York City, a distinction                        that earned him the nickname,  Boy Mayor.  A graduate of                        Columbia University and New York Law School, Mitchel held                        numerous government posts after being admitted to the bar.
While city Commissioner of Accounts, Mitchel uncovered a                        protection racket in the Police Department and conducted                        investigations that forced the ouster of two borough presidents,                        and prompted another to flee the continent.
Elected President                        of the Board of Alderman in 1909, Mitchel is credited with                        drafting the city s first comprehensive budget, with a full                        accounting of all of the city s resources.
In 1913, he dealt                        a crushing blow to Tammany Hall, winning the mayoral election                        on a fusion ticket by a large plurality.
His inauguration                        speech was unique in that he did not make bold pledges to                        reinvent government.
We will develop our program slowly.
It will not be necessary                        for us to go to the people of the city every day and tell                        them what we propose to do.
Mitchel s waste-cutting measures                          and accounting practices earned the city national acclaim.
He brought into the administration competent professionals                          and devised a zoning plan to govern city development  the first such plan in the nation.
He also standardized                          salary and work requirements for city employees.
Despite                          Mitchel s notable accomplishments, he was not reelected.
In 1918, he enlisted in the Army Air Service to be trained                          as a pilot in World War I.
His life was cut short while                          on final training in Louisiana, when his plane plummeted                          500 feet to the ground on July 6, 1918.
A few days shy                          of his 39th birthday, Mitchel was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery                          in the Bronx.

50 in                        his pocket.
He performed various odd jobs, including operating                        a steam locomotive for the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad, and                        he secured a patent for a bicycle whistle.
He graduated                        from New York Law School in 1897 and became active in politics.
Hylan successfully engineered a constitutional amendment                        in the state legislature to create two new Brooklyn judgeships  and a job for himself.
In 1917, Hylan ran for mayor                        on the Tammany Hall ticket, overwhelmingly defeating John                        Purroy Mitchel.
He delivered a simple speech during his                        inauguration, an affair devoted to dispensing patronage                        evenly between his Brooklyn supporters and Tammany Hall.
On his first day in office, Hylan charged his appointees                         to make the world yearn for Democracy  by following his                         Rules for City Employees.  He declared:                          must not roll in city automobiles with cigars in their mouths...                        be conspicuous at baseball games when they should be in                        their offices.  Dubbed  Honest John  by his supporters,                        Hylan never strayed far from the will of Tammany Hall.
He                        devoted much of his term to transit issues and was reelected                        based on his opposition to a state plan that would have                        increased the five cent subway fare.
He also was a strong advocate for New York City home rule.
Hylan ran for a third                        term, but lost the primary to James Walker and ran again                        in 1932, only to withdraw his candidacy.
He died of a heart                        attack at his home in Forest Hills on January 12, 1936.
Jimmy Walker masterfully                        combined theatrics with politics to become one of the city s                        most colorful mayors.
He composed many sentimental ballads,                        including,  Will You Love Me in December As You Do In May.                         He quickly rose through the ranks of Tammany Hall, entering                        the Assembly in 1910 and serving in the state Senate from                        1923 to 1925.
Succeeding John Hylan as mayor in 1926, Walker faithfully served the interests of Tammany Hall through                        political appointments and the awarding of contracts.
In the first two years of his                          administration, Walker indulged himself with several vacations                          overseas, spending 143 days out of office, and was fond                          of saying,  I refuse to live by the clock.  Despite rumors                          of widespread corruption, New Yorkers largely overlooked                          Walker s transgressions, electing him handily to a second                          term over Fiorello LaGuardia.
But with the outbreak of                          the Depression, Walker s neglect of essential city services                          became more readily apparent.
In 1931, the state legislature                          initiated an investigation that uncovered rampant corruption                          in New York City government.
In 1932, Walker was charged                          with accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in money                          from individuals with business ties to the city.
Called                          before then Governor Franklin Roosevelt to answer the                          charges, Walker resigned from office in the middle of                          the hearings, on September 1, 1932, and moved to Europe.
During Walker s administration, the Department of Sanitation was created and construction                          began on the Triborough Bridge, the West Side Highway,                          and the Queens Midtown Tunnel.
Walker returned to New                          York City in 1935.
His one time political nemesis, Fiorello                          LaGuardia, appointed him municipal arbiter to the garment                          industry in 1940.
He died on November 18, 1946.
Jimmy                        Walker out of office, John O Brien was elected to fill the                        remainder of Walker s term.
A.
Holy                        Cross College and his masters and law degree from Georgetown                        University.
O Brien served as City Corporation Counsel and                        as a New York Surrogate Court judge.
Tammany Hall nominated him for mayor in 1932 and he beat the Republican candidate                        by more than half a million votes.
Held in the Hall of Records,                        at 31 Chambers Street in Manhattan, O Brien s inauguration                        was devoid of the pageantry that had greeted many of his                        predecessors.
His inauguration speech did not outline a                        vision for the city, but rather, reflected on the work of                        the court and the legal profession in general.
He told his                        colleagues,  I know it will be the bar of New York that                        will understand the situation, be able to survey it critically,                        but, at the same time, fairly and justly.  Although O Brien                        is credited with expanding the city s ability to collect                        taxes, restoring order to the city s finances, and trimming                        the budget, he served just one year in office and was not                        reelected to a second term.
O Brien returned to his legal                        work and served three times as a delegate to the Democratic                        National Convention.
He died on September 22, 1951, and                        was buried, as was his predecessor, Jimmy Walker, in the                        Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Westchester County.
Italian and Jewish ancestry, Fiorello                        LaGuardia, or  Little Flower,  is widely regarded as one                        of the best mayors in New York City history, whose tenure                        redefined the office.
S.
Consulate Service in Europe, where he became fluent                        in Yiddish, German, French and Italian.
Upon graduating                        New York University Law School in 1910, LaGuardia practiced                        law and was appointed Deputy Attorney General.
LaGuardia                        was elected to Congress in 1916 on a Republican ticket,                        interrupting his term to serve as a decorated pilot on the                        Italian front in World War I  his plane was named the Congressional                        Limited .
He was elected President of the Board of Alderman                        in 1919 and returned to Congress in 1923, winning reelection                        repeatedly.
After losing the mayoral election to Jimmy Walker                        in 1929, he successfully ran for mayor again in 1933 on                        a fusion ticket against Tammany Hall.
New York City was restored                          to the people this morning at one minute after midnight.
For the next twelve years, the                          5 foot 2, sometimes belligerent chief executive dominated                          life in New York City.
He fulfilled many of his pledges,                          ferreting out corruption in city government and bringing                          in talented professionals.
LaGuardia earned a reputation                          for placing the city s interests ahead of political considerations.
Although technically a Republican, he worked closely with                          the New Deal administration of President Franklin Roosevelt                          to secure funding for large public works projects.
The                          federal subsidies enabled New York City to create a transportation                          network the envy of the world, and to build parks, low-income                          housing, bridges, schools, and hospitals.
He achieved                          the unification of the city s rapid transit system, a                          goal that had long eluded his predecessors, and reformed                          the structure of city government by pushing for a new                          City Charter.
He presided over construction of New York                          City s first municipal airport on Flushing Bay, later                          appropriately named LaGuardia Airport.
LaGuardia s psychological effect                          on New York City was equally profound, restoring faith                          in city government by demanding excellence from civil                          servants.
He was perceived as ubiquitous, always first                          to appear at a fire or natural disaster; he sometimes                          dropped in at city agencies unannounced, periodically                          conducted the municipal orchestra, spoke weekly over the                          radio, and once used that medium to read the comics to                          New Yorkers during a citywide newspaper strike.
In 1945, the first three-term                          New York City mayor decided not to seek a fourth term,                          perhaps hoping to enter national politics.
After leaving                          office, he hosted a weekly radio show and was appointed                          Director General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation                          Commission.
LaGuardia succumbed to pancreatic cancer on                          September 21, 1947 at his home in Riverdale, Bronx.
Bohola, Ireland, O Dwyer moved to the United                        States in 1910 after abandoning his studies for the priesthood.
He worked as a laborer, then as a New York City policeman.
He studied law at night at Fordham University Law School,                        receiving his degree in 1923.
O Dwyer built up a successful                        law practice and served as a Kings County Court judge.
After losing the election to LaGuardia in 1941, O Dwyer                        enlisted in the Army, achieving the rank of brigadier general.
In 1946, O Dwyer received the nomination of the Tammany                        Democrats and easily won the mayoral election.
O Dwyer established the Office                          of City Construction Coordinator, appointing Robert Moses                          to the post, worked to have the permanent home of the                          United Nations located in Manhattan, presided over the                          first billion dollar New York City budget, created a traffic                          department and raised the subway fare from five cents                          to ten.
Shortly after his reelection, O Dwyer was confronted                          with a police scandal uncovered, ironically, by the Kings                          County District Attorney.
With his health steadily failing,                          he resigned on September 1, 1950 and President Harry Truman                          appointed him as Ambassador to Mexico.
He returned to                          New York City in 1951 to answer questions concerning his                          association with organized crime figures.
The accusations                          followed him for the rest of his life.
O Dwyer resigned                          as Ambassador on December 6, 1952, but remained in Mexico                          until 1960.
He died in New York City on November 24, 1964                          and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
Italian immigrants, Impellitteri emigrated from Sicily,                        Italy to the United States in 1901, when he was just an                        infant.
He grew up in Connecticut and entered the Navy after                        finishing high school.
Upon moving to New York, Impellitteri                        attended Fordham Law School, where he received his law degree                        in 1924.
He served as Assistant New York District Attorney                        from 1929 to 1938.
In 1945, Mayor O Dwyer picked Impellitteri                        to run for Council President on the Tammany Hall slate.
When O Dwyer resigned five years later, Impellitteri served                        as acting mayor.
Tammany Hall refused to nominate him for                        the special election in November, 1950, and Impellitteri                        successfully ran as an independent under the banner of the                         Experience Party.  Impellitteri s inauguration, held on                        November 14, 1950, was swift and simple, absent a band or                        a platform.
Impellitteri s one term as Mayor                          saw the initiation and completion of many public works                          projects engineered by Robert Moses, including the construction                          of 88 miles of highway and numerous housing projects  between 1945 and 1954, 1,082 public housing buildings                          were constructed.
Impellitteri is also credited with working to rein in budget costs, raising the bus and subway fare                          to fifteen cents and increasing the sales tax.
Impellitteri                          ran for reelection in 1953, but was defeated by then Manhattan                          Borough President Robert Wagner, who later appointed him                          to a judgeship.
Impellitteri retired from the bench in                          1965 and succumbed to Parkinson s disease on January 29,                          1987 in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
S.
Senator who was a chief architect of                        Social Security, Robert Wagner Jr.
Yale University                        in 1933 and received his law degree from Yale Law School                        in 1937.
Fresh out of law school, Wagner, a lifelong Democrat,                        was elected to the Assembly, where he served three terms.
He enlisted in the Army during World War II, achieving the                        rank of lieutenant colonel.
Upon returning to New York City,                        Wagner served in different capacities under Mayor O Dwyer,                        until he successfully ran for Manhattan Borough President                        in 1949.
In 1953, Wagner ran in the Democratic primary for                        mayor with the backing of Tammany Hall.
He beat Vincent                        Impellitteri by a large margin and went on to win the general                        election.
During Wagner s twelve years as                          mayor, several large scale projects were initiated or                          completed, such as the construction of the Van Wyck Expressway,                          the Grand Central Parkway, the Long Island Expressway,                          the Verrazano-Narrows and Throgs Neck Bridges, Shea Stadium,                          and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
During Wagner s                          tenure the city also hosted the 1964-65 World s Fair.
Wagner is credited with making gains in slum clearance                          and the creation of public housing.
He reduced corruption                          in city government and expanded the police force.
He appointed                          talented professionals to serve in his administration                          and greatly increased the number of minorities in civil                          service.
Twice reelected, Wagner decided not to seek a                          fourth term in 1965, instead returning to private practice.
He was appointed ambassador to Spain from 1968 to 1969,                          resigning to run unsuccessfully in the mayoral primary.
In 1976, President Jimmy Carter named him US representative                          to the Vatican.
He practiced law in New York City and                          also served on the City Charter Revision Commission in                          the 1980 s.
In 1989, New York University named its graduate                          school of public service in his honor.
Wagner died of                          heart failure at his Manhattan home on February 12, 1991.
New York City mayor had a more trying first day in                          office then did John Lindsay.
A veteran of World War II,                          in which he served as a naval officer and achieved the                          rank of lieutenant, Lindsay graduated Yale Law School                          in 1948.
After a decade in private practice in a New York                          law firm, Lindsay went to work for the Justice Department                          in 1955, serving as a liaison to the White House and arguing                          cases before the Supreme Court.
Lindsay, a liberal Republican,                          returned to New York City and won election to Congress                          in Manhattan s heavily Democratic 17th District.
He was                          elected to four terms in the House of Representatives,                          from 1958 to 1964, before running successfully for mayor                          in 1965.
On his first day in office, Lindsay was greeted                          with a crippling transit strike that brought the entire                          city to a near standstill  it proved to be just                          the first of many bitter strikes he would contend with                          during his tenure as mayor.
The transit strike denied                          Lindsay of sleep for 26 of his first 28 hours as mayor                          and forced the cancellation of a five borough inaugural                          tour.
Upon taking office, Lindsay vowed                          to open up the  lines of communication between the people                          and their government.  While civil unrest erupted in other                          major cities during the turbulent late sixties, Lindsay                          helped maintain calm in New York City by taking walking                          tours of the city s urban ghettos.
He established the                          Urban Action Taskforce and Neighborhood City Halls to                          field complaints about municipal services  innovations                          also credited with easing tensions in poor areas.
Lindsay                          consolidated overlapping city agencies into super-agencies,                          eliminating waste and redundancy, and greatly increased                          government spending.
He decentralized the school system                          and created community school districts.
He won reelection                          in 1969 on the Liberal Party line after losing the Republican                          primary.
In 1971, he switched affiliation to the Democratic                          Party.
In 1972, he entered the presidential primaries                          in Florida and Wisconsin, losing both.
After serving out                          his second term, Lindsay returned to private life in 1973,                          working at his law practice, authoring books, and serving                          as a television commentator.
London in 1906, Beame came to the United States a year                        later.
A graduate of City College, where he received his                        degree in accounting in 1928, Beame opened up an accounting                        firm in Manhattan, taught in New York City public schools,                        and held many posts in city government, including Assistant                        Budget Director under Mayor O Dwyer, Budget Director under                        Mayor Impellitteri, and City Comptroller in 1962.
After                        an unsuccessful mayoral bid in 1965, Beame ran successfully                        as the Democratic candidate for Comptroller in 1969.
He                        ran again for mayor on the Democratic ticket in 1973, winning                        by almost 700,000 votes.
On December 31, 1973, Beame took                          the oath of office in a private ceremony at his home on                          Beach 131 Street in Belle Harbor, Queens  coincidentally,                          on the same Queens street Mayor William O Dwyer took the                          oath three decades before.
The first Jewish mayor of New                          York City, Beame told the 1,500 people gathered at the                          steps of City Hall the following day:  I hope to be a                          matchmaker in the years of my administration, wedding                          our people to their city, encouraging them to identify                          with this great metropolis that is their home.  With New                          York City on the verge of bankruptcy, Beame was forced                          to bring about massive cuts in the city s capital budget                          and to reduce the municipal payroll by 65,000.
3 billion, starting in 1976, which                          helped stave off bankruptcy.
Despite financial difficulties,                          New York City still managed to host a spectacular bicentennial                          celebration and the Democratic National Convention in                          1976 two events that demonstrated to the country,                          New York City was down but not out.
Beame was defeated                          in the Democratic primary in 1977 by Edward I.
Koch.
I.
Koch was elected the 105th Mayor of New York City in                        1977.
Born in the Bronx of Polish Jewish ancestry, Koch s                        family moved to Newark, New Jersey during the Depression                        and later moved to Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn when he was a                        teenager.
He left City College when he was drafted into                        the Army, where he became a decorated combat infantryman,                        achieving the rank of sergeant.
He received his law degree                        from New York University Law School in 1948.
As an active                        member of a Manhattan reform club, the Greenwich Village                        Independent Democrats, Koch ran successfully for district                        leader in 1963 against Carmine DeSapio.
Koch was reelected                        in 1965 and elected to the City Council the following year.
In 1968, he was elected to the House of Representatives                        in a district that hadn t sent a Democrat to Congress since                        1934.
He was reelected four times, earning a reputation                        as a competent legislator and a champion of many social                        causes.
In 1977, he sought the Democratic nomination for                        mayor among a crowded field of candidates.
Koch won the                        primary and went on to defeat Liberal Party candidate Mario                        Cuomo in the general election.
These have been hard times.
We have been drawn across the                        knife-edge of poverty.
We have been shaken by troubles that                        would have destroyed any other city.
But we are not any                        other city.
With New York City s treasury                          near empty, Koch restored the city s credit in his first                          term through a series of budget cutting measures, enabling                          the city to enter the bond market within a few years and                          raise capital funds.
As the city s fiscal prognosis began                          to brighten, so too did the mood of New Yorkers.
The characterization                          of Koch as low key was soon revised after he took office,                          with his ebullient personality, and his trademark greeting,                           How  m I Doin .  Under Koch, the city s annual budget                          doubled to $26 billion and approximately $19 billion was                          spent on capital projects in the 1980 s.
Koch, who vowed to be the first                          four term mayor, sought reelection in 1989.
However, he                          was confronted with a series of government corruption                          scandals.
He also faced heated criticism for his combative                          dealings with other public officials and the press.
He                          lost the Democratic primary to then Manhattan Borough                          President David Dinkins.
January 1, 1990, David N.
Dinkins was sworn in as the first                        African American mayor in New York City history.
Born in                        Trenton, New Jersey on October 10, 1927, Dinkins graduated                        magna cum laude from Howard University with a degree in                        mathematics and later received his law degree from Brooklyn                        Law School.
He served in the Marines in Korea and later                        married Joyce Burrows, the daughter of Harlem Assemblyman                        Daniel Burrows.
He briefly practiced law in New York City                        and began his steady ascent in politics.
He served as a                        district leader, was elected a Harlem state Assemblyman                        in 1966, served as President of the Board of Elections from                        1972-73, and City Clerk from 1975-85, before winning election                        as Manhattan Borough President in 1985.
In 1989, he ran                        for mayor, defeating Mayor Edward I.
Koch to win the Democratic                        nomination.
Dinkins went on to defeat Rudolph W.
Giuliani                        by 47,000 votes, the narrowest electoral margin in New York                        City history.
Dinkins  inauguration speech was                          punctuated with references to oppression, human rights,                          and the need for equality.
Dinkins helped fulfill his prediction                          that the  bells of freedom will ring in South Africa                           by being a national voice in favor of anti-apartheid sanctions.
He fought to have the city divest itself of $500 million                          worth of pension fund stock invested in companies that                          do business in South Africa and secured passage of a bill                          that allowed the city to rate banks on their opposition                          to apartheid.
Among his other accomplishments were creating                          the office of Special Commissioner of Investigations for                          schools, creating a system of after hour youth centers                          called Beacon Schools, and working to create an all civilian                          police complaint review board.
Known for his reserved public                          demeanor, Dinkins was sharply criticized for his handling                          of racial strife in Crown Heights, a boycott of Korean                          Grocers in Brooklyn and civil unrest in Washington Heights.
2 billion by the time he left                          office.
The economy remained sluggish throughout his term,                          preventing the enactment of much of his agenda.
He ran                          for reelection in 1993, but was defeated by Rudolph W.
Giuliani.
Dinkins still remains active in New York City                          politics, hosts a weekly radio show, and teaches public                          affairs at Columbia University.
January 1, 1994, Rudolph W.
Giuliani became the 107th Mayor                        of the City of New York; four years later, the city he inherited                        has undergone an unprecedented transformation.
The early                        1990 s were a difficult period for urban centers across                        America, where the ravages of drugs and violence were most                        acutely felt and left the greatest number of casualties.
Nowhere was this more the case than in New York City.
While                        cynics declared the city ungovernable, New Yorkers yearned                        for change.
Rudolph Giuliani was born in Brooklyn,                          New York in 1944, the son of working class Italian immigrants.
He attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School, Manhattan                          College in the Bronx, and New York University Law School,                          graduating magna cum laude.
S.
Attorney and was later named Chief of the                          Narcotics Unit before becoming Executive US Attorney.
He was named Associate Deputy Attorney General in 1975,                          and after spending three years in private practice, was                          named Associate Attorney General in 1981.
Giuliani was                          appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District                          of New York in 1983, earning national acclaim for his                          prosecution of organized crime figures, drug kingpins,                          and white collar criminals.
In 1989, Giuliani ran for                          mayor and was defeated by David Dinkins.
Giuliani ran again for mayor in                          1993, this time as the candidate of the Republican, Liberal,                          and IndependentFusion parties.
His message of fiscal                          responsibility and attention to quality of life concerns                          resonated with New Yorkers, who elected him over incumbent                          David Dinkins.
Giuliani used the occasion of his inauguration                          to stake out an ambitious agenda for change, and to reach                          out to New Yorkers by touring the five boroughs.
Dream                          with me of a city that can be better than the way it is                          now.
Believe with me that our problems can be reduced,                          not magically resolved.
5 billion.
Upon taking office, Giuliani set out to reverse New York                          City s downward spiral and improve the overall quality                          of life.
To reduce crime, he implemented                          a  zero tolerance  approach, placing an emphasis on enforcing                          laws against nuisance crimes as well as serious offenses.
Since 1993, the city has experienced an unprecedented                          44 percent drop in overall crime and a 61 percent drop                          in murder, making New York the safest large city in America.
To stimulate the city s stagnated                          economy, Giuliani reduced the tax burden by eliminating                          the Commercial Rent Tax in most areas of the city, reducing                          the Hotel Occupancy Tax, and eliminating the Unincorporated                          Business Tax.
As a result of these targeted tax cuts,                          the hotel and tourism industries are thriving, 180,000                          private sector jobs have been created, and a national                          financial magazine named New York City the most improved                          American city in which to do business.
Giuliani also cracked                          down on organized crime to lift the illegal tax the mob                          had exacted on certain New York City industries for generations.
As a result, the Fulton Fish Market, the carting industry,                          and the city s main convention center have been liberated                          from organized crime, saving businesses and consumers                          hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
8 billion through a series of cost cutting measures                          and productivity improvements.
He reduced the city s payroll                          by over 20,000 jobs without layoffs.
He kept the rate of spending below the rate of inflation for the first                          time in New York City history and created a $500 million                          reserve fund.
1 million New Yorkers                          were receiving welfare.
To bring an end to a philosophy                          that encouraged dependency on public assistance, Giuliani                          implemented the largest workfare program in the nation.
Since his welfare reforms were enacted in March of 1995,                          340,000 people have been moved off the rolls, saving $650                          million annually in city, state and federal funds.
To                          date, 175,000 people have completed the Work Experience                          Program, which provides welfare recipients with training                          to find permanent employment.

Riding a ravenous desire by voters for change, Bill de Blasio scored a crushing victory over Republican Joe Lhota Tuesday to become New York’s 109th mayor — and the first Democrat to hold the office in 20 years.
With 97% of the precincts reporting, de Blasio held a commanding lead of 74% to 24% — the largest margin of victory by a nonincumbent in any mayor’s race in city history.

Nearly seven out of 10 voters said the city needed to move in a new direction from Bloomberg’s policies, according to the survey conducted by Edison Research.
And among those wanting change, de Blasio triumphed, capturing 85% of their votes.
At 52, de Blasio is one of the youngest men elected mayor of New York.
And, as such, he also represents a generational break from Bloomberg, a 71-year-old billionaire Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent who had charted his own unique course for the city.

He showcased his handsome, biracial family — in particular his ’fro-tastic 16-year-old son Dante — in a series of campaign commercials that struck a chord in an increasingly diverse city.

And de Blasio tried to tie Lhota to the Republicans in Washington who shut down the government — a message that easily found a home in the heavily Democratic city.
Three times, de Blasio and Lhota clashed in contentious debates that exposed the stark differences between the candidates but which failed to change the dynamics of the race.

New York  CNN  – Bill de Blasio will be the first Democratic mayor in New York City in two decades, easily defeating Republican Joe Lhota by running a campaign that rejected the politics of his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg.
Known for its liberal politics, New York City has not elected a Democrat in the last five mayoral elections, with Bloomberg serving three terms and Rudolph Giuliani before him serving two.
De Blasio, who held around a 40-point lead in almost every survey since the start of the general election in mid-September, ended that streak Tuesday.
He ran a campaign with a progressive agenda, saying that Bloomberg favored the wealthy Manhattan elites and unfairly targeted minorities with the unpopular  stop-and-frisk  police policy.
1.
De Blasio was the longshot candidate for the Democrats, starting the primary campaign with just 10% of his party s support in polls before going on to win the primary.
He first surged past former Rep.
Anthony Weiner, who lost his lead when his campaign imploded after his second sexting scandal, to move neck-and-neck with Bloomberg favorite Christine Quinn, defeating her on Primary Day when he secured more than 40% of the vote and avoided a runoff.
2.
Is he qualified to run New York City?
Until recently, de Blasio was a relative unknown in New York City politics.
He is the city s current public advocate, a position that is sort of a watchdog for the people.
S.
Senate campaign.
His lack of time in the spotlight has critics questioning whether with a small staff and a thin resume he s up to running the Big Apple and the $70 billion budget that goes along with it.
De Blasio brushes off his critics by saying that he has heard the criticisms many times during his 25-year public life in New York City.
3.
De Blasio introduced himself and his biracial family by featuring them prominently in commercials and campaign events - many political watchers say to his advantage.
His 15-year-old son, Dante, has his own campaign ad speaking directly into the camera highlighting his father s views, including his stance against the unpopular NYPD  stop-and-frisk  policy.
His wife, Chirlane McCray, is front and center as his chief strategist and once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio.
4.
DeBlasio calls himself the  unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era,  saying that the current mayor s polices favor the rich.
He has repeatedly used phrases such as  income inequality  and  a tale of two cities  to describe New York City under Bloomberg.
De Blasio cites the city s 21% poverty rate as proof of this, and he campaigned on closing the gap by pushing real estate developers to build or preserve 200,000 affordable homes and creating a universal pre-K program for the poor, funded by raising taxes on those who make a $500,000 or more.
The anti-Bloomberg, wealth inequality message resonated particularly well with minority and low-income voters - de Blasio had a much larger advantage over Lhota among black and Latino voters compared to white voters.
5.
One of the most controversial issues in the race was the  stop-and-frisk  policy that allows New York police to search people in high-crime areas.
De Blasio says that this policy unfairly targets poor and minority neighborhoods and has vowed to end the policy, calling it racist.
With felony crime down 75% under the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations, Lhota called de Blasio s views on public safety  reckless  and vowed to keep the law in effect if he was elected.
De Blasio responded by saying that the city can be safer if it takes the core of what has been built and creates a better relationship between police and communities.
Hmmm, two rubbish candidates to choose from.
Hopefully in 4 years we get some better ones.
Bill de Blasio is a typical smarmy politician and think he is gonna screw this place up.
Lhota at least seemed genuine with regards to believing what he was saying, just a shame his beliefs aren t necessarily widely admired  obviously .
Anyone that vowed to end   stop and frisk  was the clear winner.
Wait for it.
New York to its knees, where it belongs for voting for a leftist loser.
Not that Bloomberg was wonderful, but he didn t want to destroy America.
While his resume and family is no blushing thing to talk about- let us see if he can deliver.
It will take only a year to get the true colors.
Further taxing the rich to help the poor only works to a certain extent after that it is counter productive.
Dem socialists are taking down the country.
God bless you, my heartfelt congrats too.
The People of NYC got tried of people trying to tell them what they can & cannot do.
This is america, not some 3rd world country run by some king lol.

After winning by a landslide on Tuesday , Bill de Blasio will soon be the mayor of the Big Apple.

Over the summer, Bill de Blasio seemed like a long shot.
But a campaign commercial featuring De Blasio s teenage son, Dante, propelled him to the forefront of the race.

De Blasio s wife, writer and poet Chirlane McCray, was once a lesbian.
When recently asked how she went from being a lesbian to falling in love with Bill, she told Essence,  By putting aside the assumptions I had about the form and package my love would come in. By letting myself be as free as I felt when I went natural.  Bill says that both his family and her family were  more than surprised  by the marriage.
3.
The new leader of New York City makes no apologies for his Massachusetts roots.

Sex and the City  star Cynthia Nixon was an active spokesperson for de Blasio, appearing in ads and at campaign events around New York City.  I feel like he s the left-wing future of politics,  Nixon told the New York Daily News .  Mr.
Chris Noth also advocated for the mayor.
Noth said in an ad.
5.
After 12 years with Mayor Michael Bloomberg in charge, de Blasio is the first Democratic mayor since David Dinkins, who left office in 1993.
De Blasio s campaign emphasized his opposition to  stop and frisk  policies in New York City, and a promise to tax the rich to fund education.
New Yorkers should expect a shift in the political winds after the Bloomberg era.

7.
De Blasio is no stranger to the Clinton clan: In fact, he was Hillary Clinton s campaign manager for her 2000 Senate campaign.
Clinton endorsed the de Blasio campaign and appeared at a fundraising event in late October that raised over $1 million.
I was very, very gratified by her endorsement, I was very gratified by what she said about the time that we worked together.
Blasio told WABC.

Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, standard-bearer of the New Left, and now… slayer of groundhogs ?
At this year’s Staten Island Zoo Groundhog Day ceremony, Mayor de Blasio fumbled the marmot after a zookeeper placed it in his hands.
The animal dropped to the ground, and within a week, it was dead.
The groundhog’s death was only reported Thursday.
It’s unclear whether the death of the Staten Island Zoo’s “Charlotte,” who was standing in for the famed Staten Island Chuck, was actually de Blasio’s fault.
A zoo spokesman told the Associated Press in an interview that the drop was “a complete bungle” and attributed it partly to the zoo handler’s weak placement of the animal in de Blasio’s hands.
And a medical examination after the incident showed that there was “no evidence of trauma or pain,” the spokesman said.
But when the animal was found dead on Feb.
9, a necropsy showed the groundhog had died of internal injuries.
We don’t know how the animal suffered the injuries but we don’t think it was from the fall,” the zoo’s spokesman said.
Thus, the mystery of the slain groundhog remains unsolved.
And we can be sure de Blasio will be closely watched next Groundhog Day, innocent as he may appear.

Has a $28,000 tax lien to the IRS.
Owes nearly $900 in unpaid parking tickets since the mayoralty began.
Has some $7,000 in EZ-Pass debts.
Case closed?
The hits keep coming, highlighting the colossal double standard at the heart of Mayor Bill’s City Hall.
What keeps Noerdlinger in her post is the only credential that matters: Prior to moving to Team DeBlasio, she served as communications director for the man who’s really running the city these days, the Rev.
Al Sharpton.
Surely the Rev can help de Blasio out of this jam.
Isn’t there someone else on Mayor Al’s payroll he can appoint to take Rachel Noerdlinger’s place?

New York  CNN  -- One day after New York officials announced a Doctors Without Borders physician had tested positive for Ebola, another person who treated patients in West Africa developed a fever and was put in isolation at a northern New Jersey hospital.
The second health care worker, a woman who hasn t been identified by name, did not have any Ebola symptoms upon arrival Friday at Newark Liberty International Airport, New Jersey health department spokesman Donna Leusner said.
Yet things changed in the hours that followed.
That woman is being tested for Ebola, according to a government official who is receiving updates about the situation.
Unlike Dr.
Craig Spencer, the 33-year-old now in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in nearby New York City, this second health care worker is not confirmed to have Ebola.
In fact, there have been far more examples in recent weeks of suspected Ebola cases than actual ones in the United States.
For all the scares, only four people -- starting with Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who died in a Dallas hospital, followed by two Dallas health care workers who d treated him, lastly Spencer -- so far have been diagnosed with the deadly virus in the United States.
Still, the concerns that Ebola could spread further remain real.
And, especially amid criticism over how the Dallas cases were handled, officials have signaled their intent to take stops to prevent it moving in.
To this end, the governors of New York and New Jersey announced Friday their states were stepping up airport screening for Ebola beyond federal requirements for travelers from Ebola-hit countries in West Africa.
The policy allows the states to determine hospitalization or quarantine for up to 21 days for travelers from the affected countries.
A mandatory quarantine is called for those who had  direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus,  including medical workers who treated Ebola patients.
The health care worker being isolated at Newark s University Hospital was among those initially quarantined as a result of this policy.
New York Gov.
Andrew Cuomo -- joined by his New Jersey counterpart, Chris Christie -- said of the shift.
Meanwhile, there continues to intense interest about Spencer, including where he was, and what risk he might have posed, before getting hospitalized Thursday.
He arrived October 17 at New York s John F.
Kennedy s airport, days after leaving Guinea where he d been treating Ebola patients.
Spencer felt fine after touching down, only to begin feeling fatigued Tuesday.
New York City health commissioner Mary Bassett -- until Thursday, at which time he also had nausea, pain and fatigue.
Up through that time, authorities said, Spencer limited his public interactions but did not eliminate them.
In fact, he jogged along the Hudson River, rode the subway, took a cab, went bowling, visited a coffee stand at a Manhattan park and ate at a meatball shop, among other activities.
But that doesn t mean he posed to a risk during that time to anyone, beyond perhaps his fiancee and two friends being quarantined and monitored, though they feel healthy.
On Friday, authorities sought to assure an anxious public that the likelihood of Spencer spreading the virus while out and about was low.
Bassett said the chances of anyone contracting the virus from contact with Spencer were  close to nil.  To show he had no fears, Cuomo vowed to ride the subway on Friday.
There is no cause for alarm,  Mayor Bill de Blasio said.  Ebola is an extremely hard disease to contract.
An image of Craig Spencer taken from his LinkedIn profile.
Spencer posted this image to Facebook on September 18.
Spencer, employed at New York s Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, has been in isolation at Bellevue since emergency personnel took him there Thursday morning.
His Manhattan apartment has been isolated.
On his Facebook page last month, Spencer had posted a photo of himself in protective gear.
The page indicates that he went to Guinea around September 18 and later to Brussels, Belgium, in mid-October.
By Friday, Spencer was in stable condition and actively talking on his cell phone from his hospital room.
He is   in good enough shape to be in conversation with everyone around him,  de Blasio said.
In a statement Thursday, Doctors Without Borders confirmed that the physician recently returned from West Africa and was  engaged in regular health monitoring.  The doctor contacted Doctors Without Borders on Thursday to report a fever, the statement said.
Kaci Hickox, a nurse who recently returned to the United States after working in Ebola-ravaged West Africa, sent CNN this image of the tent where she was being isolated for Ebola monitoring Sunday, October 26, in New Jersey.
Hospital officials told CNN the indoor tent is in a climate-controlled extended-care facility adjacent to a hospital.
Hickox has twice tested negative for Ebola.
Hickox also sent this image of the toilet facilities in the tent.
Hickox is going to be discharged, New Jersey s Department of Health said in a statement Monday, October 27.

The United States is considering a mandatory quarantine for returning health care workers from West Africa, an Obama administration official said Friday.
The move is an attempt to give clarity to a public concerned about travelers returning from the region and is not because officials fear there is a risk of transmission from people who are not exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, the official said.
Ebola has killed nearly 5,000 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
But fears about its spread has mounted since the first person diagnosed with the disease in the United States was hospitalized in Texas last month.
Thomas Eric Duncan, who had flown from Liberia to Dallas, died on October 8.
Two nurses who treated him became infected with the virus and underwent treatment, with the cases raising questions about the ability of local and federal officials to deal with an outbreak in the United States.
On Friday, the National Institutes of Health said one of the nurses, Nina Pham, had been declared free of the Ebola virus.
Pham appeared at a NIH news conference in Maryland, where she thanked Dr.
Kent Brantly, the American physician who also survived Ebola, for donating his plasma to her while she was sick.
She also thanked God, her family, friends and the medical professionals who treated her.
The other nurse, Amber Vinson, who is getting treatment for Ebola at Atlanta s Emory University Hospital, is steadily regaining her strength, and her spirits are high, her family said.
Doctors can no longer detect the virus in her body, and she ll be transferred from isolation, her mother said.
Already, all travelers coming to the United States from Ebola-affected areas will be actively monitored for 21 days, starting Monday.

Dr.
Craig Spencer, NYC s Ebola patient, ate at the restaurant before showing signs of the virus.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, trying to take the edge off the city’s Ebola fears, dined on meatballs at a restaurant previously visited by the doctor who brought the virus from West Africa.
3 degree fever after spending a couple of days crisscrossing the city, including a stop at the The Meatball Shop in Manhattan and a bowling alley in Brooklyn .
Spencer’s movements across the nation’s most populous city touched off alarm among residents and an announcement by New York, New Jersey and Illinois that the states will quarantine anyone arriving at their airports who had direct contact with Ebola patients.
As doctors question the need for such measures, de Blasio and other city officials staged events yesterday to assure residents of their safety.
This is a city that does not fall into a pattern of looking at fears,” de Blasio said at a press conference after his meal at the Meatball Shop.
Inside the West Village restaurant this afternoon, the mood was lighthearted, according to a pool press report from the Associated Press, as de Blasio, First Lady Chirlane McCray and Health Commissioner Mary Bassett dined.
All three dug into a bowl of meatballs, with de Blasio using a fork.
Spencer’s Ebola diagnosis was announced on Thursday night.
The meatball restaurant voluntarily closed for lunch Friday, and was then visited by officials from the city Department of Health and Office of Emergency Management.
At a press conference outside the restaurant, the mood was more sober, as the mayor gave an update on Ebola, saying Spencer’s fiancé and two of his friends will remain in quarantine until November 14.
Bassett said the nature of their contact was limited to hugging, shaking hands and sharing food.
Spencer is receiving antiviral drugs and will receive blood plasma, she said.
De Blasio defended Spencer against those who said he had acted recklessly in traveling in New York.

I’m not concerned,” said John Felz, having just polished off a meatball hero sandwich on the small outdoor patio.
The most unsettling part of brunch, he said, was having a phalanx of TV cameras pointed at his face as he ate.
Daniel Holzman, 35, co-owner and chef of The Meatball Shop, was relieved that his business wasn’t hindered by the doctor’s visit.
There are other businesses that haven’t been able to make it through tough times,” said Holzman, wearing a white apron over his red sweater, with a blue Meatball Shop baseball cap.
Earlier yesterday, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams bowled the first few frames of the day at The Gutter, which had been closed until noon yesterday.
His first frame, he knocked down three pins, then it devolved from there,” his spokesman, Stefan Ringel said, adding that he fittingly threw a couple of gutter balls.
Then he shot some billiards, sipped some water and left.

New York s Staten Island Zoo attempted to cover up news that the groundhog accidentally dropped by Mayor Bill de Blasio during the Groundhog Day celebration died from internal injuries a week after the fall, The New York Post reported.
Sources told the paper that the groundhog was a female replacement named  Charlotte.  She died from internal injuries a week after the fall, the source said.
5 million a year from the city.
The staff was reportedly told by the zoo to avoid telling the mayor s office.
The zoo went with the story that the animal died from natural causes.
The groundhog that normally takes part in the festivities, Chuck, was benched this year because he once bit the city s previous mayor, Michael Bloomberg.
The zoo maintains that it is  unlikely  that the animal died due to the injuries sustained in the fall, and was examined shortly after the event.

Who Is Bill de Blasio, and Could He Be New York s Next Mayor?
The newly minted Democratic frontrunner is a populist progressive and yuppie dad whose son has an awesome Afro.
The surprise new leader in the New York mayoral race is Bill de Blasio, a yuppie Brooklyn dad who’s running as a crusading liberal.
The Democratic primary is on Tuesday, and suddenly de Blasio, who spent most of the race mired in third or fourth place in a crowded field of candidates, is way out in front.
A Quinnipiac poll released this week put de Blasio, the city’s public advocate, at 43 percent, trailed by former Comptroller Bill Thompson  20 percent  and the long-presumed favorite, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn  18 percent .
Remember when Anthony Weiner rocketed into the contest, then flamed out spectacularly?
He’s down to 7 percent.
If the poll is right and de Blasio gets more than 40 percent of the vote Tuesday, he will become the Democratic nominee, heavily favored to win the general election in a city where 68 percent of voters are registered Democrats, just 11 percent are Republicans, and New Yorkers, while generally satisfied with the city’s direction, are ready for a change after 12 years of Mayor Mike Bloomberg.
But the primary electorate is difficult to poll with much precision, and even de Blasio’s campaign expects he will get less than 40 percent, putting him into an October 1 runoff with the second-place finisher.
At six feet five inches, de Blasio literally towers over the rest of the field.
The speed and extent to which he’s leapfrogged Thompson and Quinn and taken a commanding position in the race has surprised a lot of people,” says Doug Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College, who has known de Blasio since the two worked together on the 1989 mayoral campaign of David Dinkins, New York’s first and only black mayor.
His message of a city of inequalities began to resonate with a lot of people.
Despite being a fixture of the New York’s tumultuous politics for more than two decades, de Blasio remains largely unknown.
Here are eight things you might not know about the man who stands a good chance of becoming the next mayor of America’s largest city.
1.
And it’s not his birth name: Originally Warren Wilhelm, he was always called “Bill” by his family, and he took his mother’s maiden name after his father, whom he has described as an alcoholic haunted by his experience serving in World War II, left when he was young.
He had these demons that he couldn’t beat,” de Blasio recounted in a campaign video .
2.
He has a diverse family.
De Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, is black, and she and the couple’s biracial children -- Chiara, a college freshman, and Dante, a high-school junior -- have featured heavily in the campaign.
The campaign’s first TV ad featured Dante -- who sports a majestic Afro -- praising his father’s policy proposals.
According to the campaign’s research, de Blasio would be the first New York mayor in history with a child in the New York public schools.
McCray, an activist, spoken-word poet and writer, was a lesbian who wrote about her sexuality in Essence magazine in a 1979 essay.
But when she met de Blasio in 1991 -- he was an aide to then-Mayor Dinkins and she was working for the city’s human-rights commission -- she fell in love, she told Essence earlier this year.
McCray said.
But I also didn t think, Oh, now I m attracted to men.
I was attracted to Bill.
McCray and de Blasio say their families struggled to accept their relationship at first.
3.
He’s the Brooklyn candidate.
Lives in a Park Slope brownstone.
Drives a hybrid.
Put his kids in a childcare co-op.
Drinks organic milk, grows vegetables in his yard, recycles.
All the signifiers of socially conscious, bourgie Brooklynism are abundantly embodied in de Blasio, whose easygoing affect just adds to the Brooklyn-dad vibe.
In his campaign, de Blasio has branded himself the candidate of the outer boroughs, channeling residents’ resentment of the Manhattan-centric prosperity of the Bloomberg years: “We’ve seen a pattern, under the Bloomberg administration, of favoring Manhattan over the outer boroughs,” he said at a recent campaign stop.
It’s a line that cleverly positions de Blasio as the candidate of both the outer-borough working classes, including many white-ethnic and minority voters, and the educated white liberals who have increasingly taken over Brooklyn neighborhoods.
On Saturday, de Blasio’s campaign released its official get-out-the-vote Spotify playlist , featuring such hipster-beloved bands as Vampire Weekend, Florence + the Machine, and LCD Soundsystem.
4.
He’s an operative.
De Blasio got his first taste of politics working on the Dinkins  1989 campaign.
After working in the Dinkins administration, de Blasio ran New York for Bill Clinton’s reelection campaign, then took a post in the federal Housing and Urban Development department under Andrew Cuomo, who s now the governor of New York.
S.
Senate.
With Clinton dogged by accusations of carpetbagging, de Blasio appears to have been picked as much for his New York bona fides as his political chops.
While Clinton won by 12 points, de Blasio was quietly, unofficially pushed out of the campaign-manager role near the end amid concerns that his laid-back, consensus-driven management style was insufficiently decisive.
Neither Cuomo nor Clinton has endorsed a mayoral candidate, but de Blasio is said to remain on friendly terms with both.
He’s since switched from strategist to political actor, joining the City Council in 2001 and winning the public-advocate position against a better-known opponent in 2009.
His political savvy is apparent in the way he’s come from behind to dominate the mayoral contest; even opponents say he s run a smart campaign.

The attacks, he said, were plotted from inside Iraq by  networks  of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

CBSNewYork  — Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has begun enacting drastic measures to fight crime.
As CBS 2’s Christine Sloan reported Thursday, Baraka said he is so desperate to curb the violence in Newark that he is going straight to the source – the criminals themselves.
It has been a violent year in Newark.
In March, Velma Cuttino, 43, was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight as she sat in her car while stopped at an intersection.
In June, someone shot 16-year-old teenager Cheyanne Bond on a sidewalk for her iPhone.
She was killed two weeks after she graduated high school.
And in August, store owner Jose Rivas was kidnapped as he opened his supermarket, and later shot to death.
On Thursday, Mayor Baraka invited criminals, gang members, and police to a church in Newark looking for ways to prevent such crimes.
CBS 2’s Sloan was there exclusively.
During the meeting, dozens of police officers with high-powered weapons stood outside the Bethany Baptist Church, as Baraka sat inside meeting with those who have chosen a life of crime.
We pick certain segments of the city in a neighborhood, and we talk to gang members, and we talk to people on parole, and we let them and help them understand that there’s alternatives for them.
They can give up the lifestyle of committing crime,” said Newark police Director Eugene Venable.
Police officers did not go into the church during the meeting.
It was all part of a deal in which the only security personnel allowed inside were members of the Nation of Islam.
CBS 2 cameras were also kept out, and the mayor chose not to talk with CBS 2.
His police director said he did not want to turn a sensitive issue into a publicity stunt.
Venable also said the meeting did not amount to catering to criminals, as critics may say.
No, no, no, we have to reach out to people.
People have to have an opportunity to improve their lives.
Someone has to do it,” Venable said.
Gang members did not want their faces on camera, but some did speak to CBS 2.
Gangs is a part of life.
You are in Newark, New Jersey,” one man said.
Some of the gang members said they were in tears listening to Mayor Baraka, and they said the event may just help them turn their lives around.
If you sat there through the whole thing, and you listened to everything the man had to say, if it didn’t touch you then your soul gone, because he touched — he got down to the inside,” one gang member said.
While police said crime is down, Newark is still a city under siege.
The city has had 74 murders this year, compared to 249 in New York City with about 30 times the population.
I think it needs to stop,” said Kadijah Fuentes, who works in Newark.
The police director is convinced that what he has dubbed a “community call-in” will cut down on the violence, because he said it is working in other cities such as Baltimore.
Those on parole and probation were required to attend the event as part of their re-entry program.

Welcome to Beautiful Rome, New York.
The City of Rome has incredible assets that make it a unique and wonderful place to live, work, play and raise a family.
Wonderful schools, safe streets, a great labor force, countless outdoor recreational activities, amazing arts and entertainment events, and an abundance of historical treasures can all be found here.
Quality of life in Rome is unmatched and offers a magnificent opportunity for continued growth and prosperity.
12 September 2013*: Michael Rubens Bloomberg became New York City s 108th mayor on 1 January 2002, re-elected in 2005 and, more controversially, 2009.
America’s 12th richest person and proprietor of the financial data firm bearing his name, Bloomberg’s brand of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism places him in the tradition of the Democrat-leaning city’s iconoclast Republican mayors.
The mayor is also leader of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition and C40 climate change group.
Bloomberg was born into a Jewish-American family on 14 February 1942 in Medford, Massachusetts, where his father was the bookkeeper for a local dairy.
After attending Johns Hopkins University to study electrical engineering, where he was a self-financed student, he obtained his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1966.
He was then hired by Salomon Brothers to work on Wall Street.
He quickly advanced through the ranks and became a partner in 1972.
Soon after, he was supervising all of Salomon s stock trading, sales and later, its information systems.
He was dismissed in 1981 after another company acquired Salomon.
Bloomberg used his $10m stake from the Salomon sale to start his own company, an enterprise that would revolutionise the way Wall Street did business.
P.
20 subscriptions to its service; 20 years later that figure had multiplied to over 165,000 subscribers worldwide.
As the business proved its viability, the company branched out and in 1990 Bloomberg LP entered the media business, launching a news service, and then radio, television, Internet, and publishing operations.
Bloomberg’s election as mayor in 2001 came in the aftermath of 9 11, with two-term Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani prevented from standing again by term limits.
Giuliani’s tenure as mayor was notable for the zero tolerance policies he had pioneered alongside NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, having made his name as a tough city prosecutor during the 1980s.
The Republicans’ hold on City Hall comes after the Democrat era typified by the terms of Ed Koch and David Dinkins and a series of damaging splits in the late 1970s.
New Yorkers’ political allegiances are known to be fluid, with many voters prizing independence of mind rather than partisan allegiances and the ability to split ticket for elections at different levels of government.
That said, machine politics still play a part in the selection of candidates in partisan primaries.
Much is also made of ethnic voting blocs, with candidates assiduously courting the votes of Jewish, Irish, Italian and Hispanic communities.
In September 2004, Bloomberg was ranked number 34 in a Forbes poll of the 400 Richest Americans and as of 2011 the 12th richest, making him one of the richest people in the world  30th as of 2011 .
This was given as one consideration of his decision in 2001 to seek the post of New York Mayor as a Republican, rather than a Democrat, due to his belief that having no political background to draw on, the tightly organised factions in the city party would opt for a favoured son.
The New York Democrats eventually chose Mark Green, a consumer activist and associate of Ralph Nader.
Bloomberg himself defeated former Democratic Congressman and Deputy Mayor Herman Badillo in the Republican primary, which had to be re-staged because of the events of 9 11.
Despite his wealth, the Bloomberg claims to retain something of a down to earth manner, even travelling to city hall on the subway some days.
He does not reside in the official residence of the New York Mayor, Gracie Mansion, but at his own home on the Upper East Side.
He also waives his entitlement to the mayor’s salary and accepts a token payment of one dollar annually.
Bloomberg is widely acknowledged for the deft city statecraft and competence of his administration, with his managerial style of leadership credited to building on the work of his predecessor.
Bloomberg, though committed to reducing crime, has taken a more low-key stance on the issue compared to the prominence given to it by Giuliani however.
He has also called for homeland security funding to be allocated on the basis of risk and population, in light of the 9 11 attacks.
The mayor has also supported the extension of the city’s smoking ban to drinking establishments.
Since the resumption of mayoral oversight of schooling in 2000, city schools have shown few discernable gains in exam performance however and the funding by results formula introduced to incentivise higher grades has seen some question its effect.
His handling of the unsuccessful 2012 Olympic bid also led some to question his leadership, especially over his much-derided proposals to give the New York Mets a new stadium.
Given his lifelong Democrat affiliation prior to seeking the GOP nomination, Bloomberg was seen as a liberal Republican before his 2007 Independent registration and has stated his belief in gun control, a woman s right to choose abortion and same-sex marriages.
In 2012 these sticking points have seen him back away from endorsing Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, having stayed tight-lipped on any preference in 2008.
Bloomberg coasted to re-election in 2005, defeating his Democrat challenger, the former Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, by a margin of 20 per cent, the highest ever for a Republican in the city.
Bloomberg was re-selected unopposed by the Republicans for their nomination, though one disgruntled party activist ran as a Conservative in the race in opposition to Bloomberg s liberal outlook and  betrayal  of Republican ideals.
Though initially prevented from standing again at the end of his term in 2009, Bloomberg has already joined Rudy Giuliani and Fiorello LaGuardia as the city s most successful Republican mayors  in October 2008 the city council voted to suspend its term limits on account of the financial crisis, enabling him to successfully run for a third term.
Mayor Bloomberg frequently appeared in press speculation linked to a potential presidential bid in 2008, not least because of the wide-open field this time round.
In June 2007 he changed his registered affiliation from Republican to Independent, feverishly renewing such speculation.
Though reticent on his post-mayoral ambitions and coy about stating anything beyond a return to philanthropy once he departs from city hall, permutations of a Bloomberg ticket included Los Angeles Mayor Villaraigosa, a Democrat, as a potential vice president to add political and geographical balance.
However, Bloomberg’s social liberalism, most notably his stance on gun control, seen as hardline anti in key swing states, would have rendered such a bid difficult to say the least.
Though hailed for his work as the figurehead of the 600-strong Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition, the outrage which followed Bloomberg s foray outside of his own city jurisdiction, not to mention state, into Virginia as part of an entrapment stunt designed to demonstrate the state s lax gun laws, was seen as a wider sign of his Yankee stigma to the electorate south of the Mason-Dixon line.
In February 2008 Bloomberg killed off any speculation once and for all when he stated:  I am not  and will not be  a candidate for president.  Ahead of the 2012 race, Bloomberg sought to draw a line under any discussion by saying “no way, no how”, as he also did concerning a mooted run for state governor in 2010.
In the final year of his third and his final term as mayor, Bloomberg can point to an administration notable for not only his economic stewardship but also bold and innovative stances on social and environmental issues.
He has also made great efforts to promote the city s tech sector globally, even going so far as to learn how to code himself.
Even amid the US’ struggling economy and the federal level’s preoccupation with this, Bloomberg has also made great strides in environmental leadership, taking over in 2010 as Chair of the C40 group of global cities addressing climate change.

It has been said that Bilbao’s transformation from a declining industrial city in Spain’s Basque Province to an international centre for tourism and the arts has been sparked off by two events: the opening of Guggenheim Museum in 1997 and the election of Iñaki Azkuna as mayor two years later.
When in the early 1990s Bilbao decided to spend almost US$230 million of public money on a museum of modern, many doubters accused the city of squandering precious resources.
But developments since then have silenced the critics.
4 billion to the Basque Province’s GDP since October 1997.
Since being first elected, Mayor Iñaki Azkuna has used the high profile of the Guggenheim Museum, designed architect Frank Gehry, to re-build the city.
The Bilbao Guggenheim has become as iconic as the Sydney Opera House, he said.
New York s Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks at Britain s opposition Labour Party s conference in Manchester, September 24, 2014.
13 for potentially thousands of people working in the city.
The increase, which expands an existing program to cover more New Yorkers, applies to workers employed by large businesses that are tenants of buildings developed with the help of more than $1 million in city subsidies.
The move comes as cities across the United States push ahead with so-called living wage initiatives to raise wages for workers at the bottom of the pay scale.
Blasio said from a playground in the Bronx, one of the city s five boroughs, with a large working-class population.
The order is expected to apply to an estimated 18,000 employees, including many restaurant and retail workers, over the next five years.
Previously, it largely excluded retail employees and applied to some 1,200 workers.

The rate increase will have some exclusions, including small businesses with gross income less than $3 million annually.
Critics of the measure say that the mandatory minimum will discourage businesses from leasing spaces in city-backed buildings.
Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive officer of the Partnership for New York City.
The organization represents 200 large companies that employ around 775,000 New Yorkers.
De Blasio plans to lobby state lawmakers for the authority to increase the $8-an-hour state minimum wage on a citywide level.

MYLC has had a major impact in my life and has made me realize the type of change I want to make.
MYLC has helped me build on skills such as public speaking, research and above all confidence.
Mayor s Youth Leadership Council is supported by the Office of the Mayor and Deutsche Bank Foundation.
Mayor s Youth Leadership Council  MYLC  prepares a diverse group of young people to serve as a critical advisory resource to City Hall while developing their own leadership skills.
The MYLC offers an important vehicle for youth input into city policymaking; provides young people with leadership training and creates a body of youth ambassadors to serve as liaisons to their peers and their communities.
Most importantly, it involves young people as valued and active participants in city policies that shape their every day lives.

The Mayor s Youth Leadership Council is a 2-year program with two main components: the program year and the alumni year.
The program year begins in August with a full-time, two-week orientation component that will lead into weekly after-school sessions as well as one monthly Saturday session starting in September and concluding in June.
During this time, participants will build their knowledge about current youth policy issues facing the city and develop leadership, personal and group skills and policy understanding to help city officials develop solutions.
The cohort will conduct field research on one current issue impacting New York City youth and present their policy recommendations on the topic to the Mayor and key city officials.
During the alumni year, participants graduate to serve as a formal advisory council to the Mayor s Office.
The council works to implement and continue the work of their first year by working alongside the appropriate city agency to move their recommendations forward.
MYLC members will also take an active role in supporting the leadership development of the next cohort of council members.
Coro accepts a diverse cohort of 20 NYC public tenth and eleventh-grade high school students to participate in the Mayor s Youth Leadership Council.
Ideal candidates have an interest in public service and a strong desire to impact change in the city as demonstrated through their active involvement in school clubs or community organizations.
They must also be able to commit to our 2 year program structure.
Applicants must receive a letter of recommendation from an adult that has worked with them in a professional capacity.
LEARN about current youth policy challenges from experts of different perspectives and how city government works to address them.
DEVELOP leadership skills in order to affect change across the city and in their communities.
ADVISE decision makers in the Mayor s Office and other city officials about important youth policy issues using their knowledge and skills.

By 2050, New York City will emit 80 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than it did in 2005, under a new plan announced Sunday by Mayor Bill de Blasio.
The plan will focus first on buildings, whose heating, cooling and power are responsible for almost three-quarters of New York City’s emissions.
Over the next 10 years, the city will work to reduce the level of emissions coming from about 4,000 buildings by about 30 percent compared to 2005 levels.
4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
The city’s plan acknowledges that achieving an 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2050 won’t be easy — both for buildings and for the rest of the city’s emitters — but it outlines a few ways that the city plans to tackle its greenhouse gasses.
In all city-owned buildings, the city plans to install 100 megawatts of on-site renewable power and also work to improve the buildings’ energy efficiency.
The city also plans to implement new, more-energy efficient standards for new construction, using principles of “zero net energy” and carbon neutral construction to inform the standards.
For existing buildings, the city plans to set targets to help keep buildings on track in their emissions reduction goals.
The plan is also singling out affordable housing as a sector with major potential for retrofitting, and highlighted the Knickerbocker Commons , an affordable housing building in the city that meets strict “Passive House” energy efficiency standards, as an example of what energy efficiency programs can achieve.
Achieving an 80 by 50 target will require nothing short of a dynamic transformation in the way energy is used in our buildings,” the plan states.
Overall, the City must cut energy use across all building sectors on average by at least 60 percent from 2005 levels and switch to renewable fuel sources to be on target for 80 by 50.
The city also plans to train more than 7,500 residents and building operators in the best ways to ensure buildings are energy efficient, training that the plan states will help open up career growth opportunities for some trainees.
4 billion each year.
At the beginning of his time as Mayor of New York, de Blasio’s commitment to climate change wasn’t clear : the mayor hadn’t made sustainability issues and climate change a major part of his campaign, and his administration was quiet on the issue for the first several months of his tenure.
De Blasio also marched in New York City’s People’s Climate March on Sunday, a protest that’s being called the largest climate march in history.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio  will sign an executive order on Tuesday to expand the city s living wage measure to include thousands of additional workers.
Sept 29  Reuters  - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to  expand the city s living wage measure to include thousands of  additional workers, as well as increase the amount workers are  paid under the law, the New York Times reported on Monday.
De Blasio will sign an executive order on Tuesday to make  the change, which his administration estimated could extend  coverage to 18,000 workers over the next five years, the  newspaper said on its website.
90 an hour, the paper said.
The planned action follows moves by several cities to raise  wages for workers at the bottom of the pay scale.
25 an hour by 2017.
During his campaign for mayor last year, de Blasio railed  against economic inequality in America s most populous city.
We cannot continue to allow rampant and growing income  inequality,  de Blasio told the paper.  Every tool counts.
The mayor s executive order would cover employees of  commercial tenants in development projects that take in more  than $1 million in city subsidies, the paper said.
The 18,000 workers who would be covered represent about 70  percent of all jobs at businesses that will get financial help   from the city s Economic Development Corporation, it added.
The city s living wage law was passed in 2012, and officials  told the newspaper that it applied to about 1,200 jobs.
10 an hour, from $8  now, and allow New York City and other areas to set it 30  percent higher.
If approved by the state legislature, the plan could allow  de Blasio to match the minimum wage to the living wage.
Seventy-three percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour and indexing it to inflation, according to a recent poll.
Low-wage workers spend more when the minimum wage is raised, according to a 2011 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
This spending in turn boosts the economy and job growth, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
A number of studies have found that raising the minimum wage does not reduce total employment by a meaningful amount.
The minimum wage has kept teens in high school longer by reducing the number of low-wage jobs available to them, according to one study.
Though Rep.
For example, fast food restaurants in Texas did not raise prices in response to federal minimum wage increases in 1990 and 1991, according to one study.
The erosion of the minimum wage -- that is, the decline of its purchasing power as prices rise -- contributed to income inequality among poorer Americans in the 1980s, according to one study.
Minimum wage increases did not lead to reduced worker benefits, according to two studies.
In New Jersey,  employers did not cut their workers  hours in response to the state s 1992 minimum wage hike, according to one study.
Contrary to popular belief, 84 percent of minimum-wage workers are age 20 or older, according to the Economic Policy Institute.

NEW YORK — An emergency room doctor who recently returned to the city after treating Ebola patients in West Africa has tested positive for the virus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.
It s the first case in the city and the fourth in the nation.
The mayor said Thursday there s no reason for residents to be alarmed by the doctor s Ebola diagnosis.
He said all city officials followed  clear and strong  protocols in their handling and treatment of Craig Spencer, a member of Doctors Without Borders .
Blasio said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will do a further test to confirm the initial results, has dispatched anEbola response team to New York, and the city s disease detectives have been tracing the doctor s contacts to identify anyone who may be at risk.
The city s health commissioner, Mary Bassett, said Spencer s fiancee and two friends had been quarantined.
City officials say Spencer acknowledged riding the subway and taking a cab to a Brooklyn bowling alley in the past week before he started showing symptoms.
His Harlem apartment was cordoned off, and his fiancee, who was not showing symptoms, was being watched in a quarantine ward at Bellevue.
The Department of Health was on site across the street from the apartment building Thursday night, giving out information to area residents.
Health officials say the chances of the average New Yorker contracting Ebola, which is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, are slim.
Someone can t be infected just by being near someone who s sick with Ebola.
Someone isn t contagious unless he is sick.
Symptoms are similar to malaria and cholera.
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has killed about 4,800 people.
In the United States , the first person diagnosed with the disease was a Liberian man, who fell ill days after arriving in Dallas and later died, becoming the only fatality.
Two nurses who treated him were infected and are hospitalized.
According to a rough timeline provided by city officials, Spencer s symptoms developed Wednesday, prompting him to isolate himself in his apartment.
When he felt worse Thursday, he and his fiancee made a joint call to authorities to detail his symptoms and his travels.
EMTs in full Ebola gear arrived and took him to Bellevue in an ambulance surrounded by police squad cars.
Doctors Without Borders, an international humanitarian organization, said per the guidelines it provides its staff members on their return from Ebola assignments,  the individual engaged in regular health monitoring and reported this development immediately.  As of Oct.
14, the organization said 16 staff members have been infected and nine have died.
Spencer, 33, works at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center.
S.
All recovered.
Health care workers are vulnerable because of close contact with patients when they are their sickest and most contagious.
In West Africa this year, more than 440 health workers have contracted Ebola and about half have died.
Spencer is from Michigan and attended Wayne State University School of Medicine and Columbia s University Mailman School of Public Health.
According to his Facebook page, he left for West Africa via Brussels in mid-September.
A photo shows him in full protective gear.
He returned to Brussels Oct.

Welcome to the City of Buffalo and thank you for visiting our website.
As the 58th Mayor of Buffalo, I am excited about the progress we’ve made throughout our great city, a remarkable urban transformation that is attracting attention across the country.
With a rich history, a tradition of innovation and a culturally and ethnically diverse citizenry, Buffalo possesses tremendous resources that have helped our city to achieve fiscal stability, economic investment and job growth and a positive environment that is attracting new families and investors to Buffalo.
Buffalo now has one of the lowest effective tax rates in the region and the lowest permit fees within a 500 mile radius.
The continuing expansion of the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus will soon see the arrival of the University at Buffalo Medical School, the $200 million John R.
Oishei Women and Children’s Hospital and new $46 million headquarters for Catholic Health.
Downtown development includes the return of two-way vehicular traffic to downtown Main Street, the ongoing development of the $40 million Tishman Building and the $50 million Larkin District Redevelopment.
Buffalo’s revitalized waterfront continues to become more prosperous and vibrant.
I am proud that my plan to transform two surface parking lots into two major private development projects is responsible for bringing a quarter billion dollar investment to the downtown waterfront.
From our many cultural institutions such as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the historic Colored Musicians Club, the Buffalo Science Museum and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra to thriving commercial districts and our wonderfully diverse neighborhoods, Buffalo is a city with a renewed feeling of hope and optimism.

Elected Mayor with over 60 percent of the vote in the November 2005 General Election, Mayor Brown came into office emphasizing greater accountability and efficiency in City Hall, improving the quality of life for all city residents and a commitment to strengthening and expanding the city’s economic development activities.
Since taking office, Mayor Brown has followed those three guiding principles by launching a Zero Tolerance Law Enforcement initiative targeting quality of life crimes, along with other criminal activity in the city; implemented the management accountability tracking CitiStat Buffalo program, which monitors city departments’ service delivery activities on a weekly basis; and reconfigured the city’s economic development activities by creating the Department of Economic Development, Permit and Inspection Services, a change that has provided greater coordination and cooperation in all development activities taking place in the City of Buffalo.

New York City s five district attorneys have tried for months to get a group meeting with Mayor de Blasio to discuss crucial budget and public safety issues, as they have with past mayors, but their requests have been ignored, NBC 4 New York has learned.
Melissa Russo reports.
New York City s five district attorneys have tried for months to get a group meeting with Mayor de Blasio to discuss crucial budget and public safety issues, as they have with past mayors, but their requests have been ignored, NBC 4 New York has learned.
Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson sent an email on behalf of the group in March to meet with the mayor, according to sources familiar with the request.
In the email, Johnson acknowledged de Blasio’s  tight schedule  and asked that the mayor meet with him and the other four district attorneys at his convenience to discuss  how to work together  in the best interest of the city.
We feel that we are an important part of the city s efforts to provide public safety.
NBC 4 New York.
Johnson s office said the mayor s scheduler responded,  Thank you, we will be in touch,  but the mayor s office never followed up.
Phone requests for meetings followed, sources said, but no meeting was arranged.
While the five district attorneys are independent elected officials, City Hall funds their offices, and their budgets directly affect their respective caseload capacities.
De Blasio spokesman Phil Walzak said a meeting would be scheduled.
The mayor looks forward to meeting with the five DAs.
Walzak said.
He also said that the administration has had communication with the district attorneys despite not having a formal meeting on the calendar.
Walzak said.
One senior official inside a district attorney s office contrasted the top prosecutors’ difficulty getting a meeting with de Blasio and the Rev.
Al Sharpton s seemingly unlimited access to the mayor.
Many of those meetings came in the aftermath of the death of Eric Garner, the 43-year-old Staten Island father who died in police custody after being put into a chokehold in July.
Sharpton runs the National Action Network and is a talk show host on MSNBC, which is owned by WNBC s parent company, NBCUniversal.
Democratic candidate for Mayor Bill de Blasio  TOP C , son Dante  L , daughter Chiara  BOTTOM C  and wife Chirlane McCray  BOTTOM R  celebrate at his primary night party on September 11, 2013 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.
New York City Public Advocate Bill de Blasio is poised to become the city s next mayor, and he may have his kids to thank for it.
With the most recent Quinnipiac poll showing de Blasio dominating his Republican competitor Joseph Lhota, 65 percent to 26 percent, the Democrat is expected to easily win Tuesday s race.
Yet back in July , de Blasio was trailing in the Democratic primary behind City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, even after poaching supporters from scandal-plagued Anthony Weiner.
Then in early August, de Blasio launched a campaign-defining ad starring his teenage son Dante.
Sporting a large afro, the young African-American praises de Blasio s positions on issues like affordable housing and New York s controversial stop-and-frisk policy.
Only at the end of the ad does he acknowledge that the Italian-American Democrat is his father.
By mid-August, de Blasio was in the lead in the Democratic primary.
While de Blasio s candidacy was already on the rise, political observers say the  Dante  ad marked a turning point for his campaign.
De Blasio s decision to make his two children, Dante and his 18-year-old daughter Chiara, a prominent part of his campaign was a political risk that paid off.
De Blasio s children helped voters relate to the candidate on a number of levels, Sheinkopf said.
With around 170 languages spoken in the borough of Queens alone, diversity counts.
Specifically having his African-American son broach the issue of stop-and-frisk was also effective.
The Aug.
13 Quinnipiac poll , which showed de Blasio leading the other Democratic candidates, revealed that 60 percent of likely Democratic voters were critical of stop-and-frisk -- and among those who were critical of the policy, the plurality supported de Blasio.
Showcasing the de Blasio children cast the campaign as a  family effort,  Sheinkopf said.
Sheinkopf said.
While many high-profile children of politicians have famously been shielded from the spotlight  see: Chelsea Clinton, Barbara and Jenna Bush, and Malia and Sasha Obama , it s not unheard of for children to play a role in political campaigns, but it s not something that can be forced.
The de Blasio kids took an active interest in their father s campaign, and Dante on multiple occasions threw out the professional talking points he was handed and spoke from the heart, according to John del Cecato, the political strategist who created the  Dante  ad.
Kids that age are incapable of insincerity,  del Cecato told the Daily Beast.  You could ask a 15 year old to act a certain way or to say something they didn t mean, but you are not going to get a response you like because they won t do it.
I think part of it was that he didn t need direction, that he wouldn t take direction and was going to say it the way he wanted.
De Blasio s opponent Lhota has a 22-year-old daughter, Kathryn Lhota, who has opted to help her father without putting herself in the spotlight.
Being out and meeting people and hearing about the city they want to have over the next eight years, that s where I m comfortable.
Wall Street Journal .
This is a campaign about the future of New York, not about your children.
Still, the prominence of the de Blasio children in the campaign has left Lhota in an awkward position.
Sheinkopf said.

Amanda Burden, considered one of the most influential figures in New York City government, has led the planning office under Mayor Michael Bloomberg for nearly a dozen years.
The city s transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, has garnered national attention for building pedestrian plazas and bicycle lanes throughout the city.
Sadik-Khan listens behind Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz -- a sometimes-adversary who has called her a “zealot” -- at the opening of a new pedestrian plaza.
Under Sadik-Khan’s tenure, the transportation department has added more than 285 miles of new bicycle lanes.
Mayor Bloomberg and his lieutenants frequently refer to the city’s waterfront as the “sixth borough” and view development and parks alongside it as major priorities.
One of Burden’s favorite spots is South Street Seaport, a historic part of Lower Manhattan that was later redeveloped to include shopping and restaurants.
The city aggressively pushed for the development of Select Bus Service, a new approach to busing that includes dedicated lanes and off-board fare collection to make rides quicker and more reliable.
With Mayor Bloomberg s term in office ending this year, many observers have questioned whether the city s progress on bike and pedestrian issues will continue under his successor.
On Broadway outside of Macy s, one of Sadik-Khan s pedestrian plazas stands in a lane once used by cars.
One of the final efforts of the Bloomberg administration will be an attempt at rezoning the area surrounding Grand Central Station to allow taller office buildings.
The High Line -- a linear park from the ruins of long-abandoned elevated railroad tracks -- has drawn international acclaim and spawned increased development in Chelsea.
A former homeless shelter in Chelsea was recently remade into the high-priced Dream Downtown Hotel.
Some critics say Burden and Bloomberg’s planning approach primarily benefits the well-to-do.
Construction has begun on the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, a mixed-used real estate development being erected atop a train yard in Midtown Manhattan.
Inside New York City Planning Director Amanda Burden’s office a block from city hall, a huge photograph of Brooklyn’s waterfront leans against the wall.
It’s not a pretty image.
Dotting the East River are two miles of grungy warehouses, largely abandoned, with chain-link fencing choking off the river from the city.
It’s the same scene that Burden showed Mayor Michael Bloomberg when she took him on a tour of New York City more than 11 years ago, back when he was just starting to consider a run at the city’s highest office.
The tour along that waterfront, Burden says, was an emotional experience, since both she and Bloomberg saw an amenity that New Yorkers could potentially be enjoying but instead had long been denied.
Today, as Bloomberg’s third and final term in office is drawing to a close, it’s clear that the meeting had an impact on both of them.
The two have taken to referring to New York’s waterfront as the city’s “sixth borough,” and developments along the water -- from Brooklyn Bridge Park in Brooklyn to Freshkills Park in Staten Island to the East River Esplanade in Lower Manhattan -- have been among the administration’s highest-profile undertakings.
Those projects have been touted as economic development drivers, and they are.
But just as important, they’re key to the idea of livability -- that sometimes hard-to-define concept that makes it enjoyable to call a certain place home.
In the end, great public space is what makes people want to stay in the city,” says Burden, who’s held her position since Bloomberg first took office.
You live in this high-density, high-energy environment.
Bloomberg’s time in office has been about much more than parks, of course.
America’s most famous mayor has gained international attention for his ardent advocacy on issues like gun control, immigration reform, infrastructure investment and climate change.
More controversially, he’s well known -- and sometimes lampooned -- for enacting bans on trans fats, smoking in public places, and big, sugary beverages.
But for New Yorkers, Bloomberg’s most important legacy -- the one that affects their daily lives most -- may be the role he’s played in reshaping the urban landscape.
If predecessor Rudolph Giuliani was the mayor who made New York a safer place to live, Bloomberg is the guy who’s made it a more pleasant one.
Through an unprecedented emphasis on parks, pedestrians and development, Bloomberg’s signal achievement could be the physical transformation of the city.
His commitment to livability has put an indelible imprint on Gotham.
Now, his mayoral tenure is coming to an end; a new leader will be elected in six months.
And there’s one question that underscores every conversation about the upcoming election: Can the momentum of the Bloomberg years continue?
There’s a small park in SoHo called Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino Square.
For decades, it was hardly more than a forgotten concrete triangle surrounded by streets on all sides.
As Mitchell Moss, a New York University urban planning professor and media-dubbed “New Yorkologist,” walks past Petrosino Park, he says it was a “shithouse for meth heads” until a few short years ago.
Then things changed.
The city  in a $2 million project championed by former Councilman Alan Gerson  enlarged the park and added new benches, trees and lighting.
Today, it’s a tony greenspace for neighborhood residents, workers and shoppers, who meet in Petrosino to share lunch, walk their dogs or just take a break.
Up until now, most mayors viewed parks as something they could cut,” Moss says.
That’s changed, in dramatic fashion.
Petrosino Park is a small-scale example.
Brooklyn Bridge Park is a much larger one.
Creating a park along Brooklyn’s disused post-industrial waterfront has been the subject of debate for 30 years.
Now it’s one of the great gems of the city,” Moss says.
Progress is continuing on the 85-acre park, with bocce courts, soccer fields, summer concerts and even the occasional pop-up swimming pool.
And there’s an even bigger example on Staten Island, where the Fresh Kills landfill is being transformed into a 2,200-acre park.
That project, which has been under way since 2008, will result in the largest park developed in the city in a century.
And, perhaps most famously, there’s the completion of the High Line, the internationally known project that wrested a spectacular linear park from the ruins of long-abandoned elevated railroad tracks in Chelsea.
The mile-long park has significantly altered the neighborhood around it, attracting tremendous new development and becoming a favorite spot for residents and visitors alike.
High Line” has become shorthand for planners and activists worldwide who want to transform the derelict into something dazzling.
I think for a good 50 years, there was a sense that this is our city, and we’re stuck with it,” says Aaron Naparstek, a fellow at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design and founder of the website Streetsblog, which covers land-use and transportation policy in New York.
We clearly have moved into a new era now where people see that it’s really possible to redesign New York City streets, the waterfront, the public spaces and the parks,” Naparstek continues.
These things are not just set in stone.
Indeed, Bloomberg observers say he’s been successful in making major changes in the city -- and getting them done quickly -- for two big reasons.
For starters, he’s a political outsider who is independently wealthy, making him beholden to nobody.
He’s not afraid to take risks,” says Robert Lieber, who served as Bloomberg’s deputy mayor for economic development from 2008 to 2010.
Bloomberg also has a reputation for avoiding micromanagement, empowering his deputies and loyally defending them from any political fallout they may encounter.
Those close to him say that while livability is absolutely one of the mayor’s priorities, he’s comfortable deferring the specifics to his lieutenants.
Really, he gives you an enormous amount of leeway to come up with your plans,” Lieber says.
He’ll support you and defend you.
This is what a chief executive does.
He knows how to run a business.
Janette Sadik-Khan has perhaps been the biggest beneficiary of an administration that has been unafraid to shake things up.
As Bloomberg’s transportation commissioner since 2007, Sadik-Khan has transformed the role of her office by placing a serious emphasis on pedestrians and bicyclists.
Under her leadership, the city has created 300 miles of bicycle lanes.
She’s been on a quest to make streets safer and more accessible to those who use modes of transportation besides driving.
And she’s probably not exaggerating when she says her office has made the most significant changes to New York’s roadways since one-way streets were introduced 50 years ago.
Our streets were out of balance,” Sadik-Khan says.
They were not designed for the demands that are on them today.
That’s really what we’re doing.
In addition to the unprecedented proliferation of bike lanes in New York, the department this spring will help launch the largest bike-share program in the country, capitalizing on an urban amenity that has proven extraordinarily popular in other cities.
And throughout New York, Sadik-Khan’s department has embarked on an ambitious plaza program: Using planters and other barricades, the city has blocked off parts of some streets to establish pedestrian plazas with benches and chairs.
Among the most prominent of the new plazas are those in Times Square and further south along Broadway, where pedestrians lounge or stroll along streets that were, at one time, major thoroughfares filled with honking cars.
Times Square -- that whole area -- was just a Gordian knot of traffic,” Sadik-Khan says.
Ninety percent of the street was dedicated to cars, yet 90 percent of the people there were pedestrians.
It was really out of balance.
Like others throughout the Bloomberg administration, Sadik-Khan focuses intently on data, and she uses it to help justify her programs.
She says pedestrian deaths are down and business is up in places that have gotten the pedestrian bicycle overhaul from her department.
Still, that doesn’t always make her popular.
She’s frequently been criticized by New York tabloids.
And the bike lanes have even become the subject of lawsuits.
Sadik-Khan says she doesn’t worry about the political implications of her department’s initiatives -- and that’s something she says she has in common with her boss.
After all, Times Square was pedestrianized in 2009, an election year.
A mayor with a more conservative style might have waited until after November to pursue such an unusual undertaking, Sadik-Khan says.
Still, Sadik-Khan  and Bloomberg by proxy  have been criticized for their hardball techniques.
Her office has a reputation for literally transforming streets in the dark of night, which some believe is intended to make it difficult to block the work.
The New York Times has chronicled a technique used by the administration -- and in particular the transportation department -- to launch projects as “pilots,” as a clever way to cut through red tape and escape the typical city review process.
When asked about her reputation as someone who’s more effective at getting things done than building consensus, Sadik-Khan is unapologetic.
We really didn’t have a choice.
Amanda Burden, the planning director, is the other half of the administration’s team that has played a significant role in reshaping the city.
Her approachable demeanor and affable tone belie her status as what some observers call the most influential person in the city’s political power structure besides Bloomberg himself.
She’s been described as a woman with the ideals of Jane Jacobs and the power of Robert Moses.
It’s fun.
There are choices.
It’s diverse, and  always a sense of change -- something new and exciting.
A former socialite and an heir to the Standard Oil fortune, Burden eschewed a life of privilege for a career in urban planning.
She has worked on the City Planning Commission since 1990; when Bloomberg took office in 2002, he appointed her chair of the commission and head of the Planning Department.
Since then, her office has led an ambitious program that has rezoned an unprecedented 40 percent of the city.
To those not steeped in the world of planning, that accomplishment may not sound noteworthy.
But it’s been an integral part of opening access to the waterfront, facilitating parks improvements and developing land-use patterns most suited for the city’s future population growth.
Bloomberg has elevated the prominence of planning and zoning issues, giving Burden’s office unmatched influence and facilitating initiatives like the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, a mixed-used real estate development being erected over a train yard along the western edge of Midtown Manhattan, or the development of Lower Manhattan’s Seward Park, which will create a mixed-used space on six acres of underutilized land that will include a new market, commercial space and affordable housing.
People knew the status quo wasn’t acceptable,” says Moss, the NYU professor.
In New York, development occurs “as-of-right,” meaning that if a developer wants to build something that conforms exactly to the existing zoning standards, he can do so with little more than a building permit.
In reality, the city’s zoning regulations are so outdated that developers frequently need special approval.
The administration, through Burden, is changing those zoning guides to upzone for higher density in areas that are transit hubs like Jamaica, Queens; Downtown Brooklyn; and Long Island City -- and downzone in areas that aren’t suited to big growth.
Eventually, the goal is to make as-of-right development widespread, so that developers don’t need special approval.
The concept of setting the table to allow these neighborhoods to grow and change is a positive thing,” says Mitch Korbey, a land-use attorney and director of the planning department’s Brooklyn office under Mayor Giuliani.
As Burden has gone through that process, she’s gotten creative.
In addition to using the traditional tools of her profession -- things like height limits and setback requirements -- she’s including provisions that encourage bike parking, environmental components and affordable housing.
We use zoning for a variety of different things that nobody’s even thought about,” Burden says.
The city’s most creative rezoning effort has been the High Line.
In addition to being one of the earliest champions of the park itself, Burden created the rezoning mechanism that helped make the work possible.
Owners of land underneath the rail line had wanted it demolished since it kept them from building vertically.
Her office allowed landowners to sell those air rights to nearby sites where higher developments would be permitted.
That’s caused a real estate boom in the area surrounding the park, a stretch along the west side of Midtown Manhattan that had long been underdeveloped.
Burden has gained a reputation for having a granular focus on aesthetic design details.
Supporters say that fine eye has served the city well, but some developers have called it strong-arming, and have accused Burden of overstepping her bounds as a civil servant.
Like Sadik-Khan, Burden makes no apologies for her style.
We’ve tried to raise the bar for what’s expected in design.
And that has really been important, not only for iconic, cultural buildings, but in areas like the South Bronx” where thousands of new housing developments are being built, she says.
And even if some developers have bristled at Burden’s approach, it has served New York well, says Korbey.
Projects are better because of this.
New York is a better place to live now than it was a decade ago.
It’s difficult to find anyone who would dispute that sentiment.
But can the progress on livability continue once Bloomberg has left office?
Will the next mayor build something like the High Line?
Will Bloomberg’s successor tackle anything as ambitious as transforming Times Square?
It’s unclear, thanks in part to the wide-open field of candidates.
Among them are Christine Quinn, the speaker of the New York City Council who’s seen as Bloomberg’s heir apparent; Public Advocate Bill de Blasio; Joseph Lhota, who recently resigned as chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority; Bill Thompson, the former city comptroller; and Joseph Liu, the current comptroller.
There’s a common thread here: All of those candidates come from typical political proving grounds.
Moss, the planning professor, calls them an uninspiring bunch, and he warns of a possible “return to normalcy” under any of them.
While there are many candidates, they’ve said little or nothing about what they plan to do with the city’s physical space.
However it shakes out, Streetsblog’s Naparstek says, New Yorkers will likely miss the independence that comes with a billionaire mayor who’s a political outsider.
They’ll get a reminder of what it’s like to have a regular old Democrat back in city hall who really feels like he or she has to take heed and pay attention to whatever cranky rant is coming out in the Daily News on Thursdays,” Naparstek says.
Mayor Bloomberg did have a unique ability, for better or for worse, to ignore a lot of that stuff and didn’t really feel so beholden to it.
Some urban advocates are concerned not just about livability in the abstract but about whether some of the administration’s efforts may literally be undone.
De Blasio has called Sadik-Khan a “radical,” and Quinn has said Sadik-Khan’s style has contributed to the controversy surrounding bike lanes.
Some wonder whether the next mayor would literally start removing bike lanes.
And there are those who actually are leery of the Bloomberg livability campaign.
Bloomberg’s critics say the rash of development under his leadership has been a boon for developers and gentrifiers but has done little to benefit the average New Yorker.
Marquee parks and public spaces are great for wealthy residents, 20-something urbanites and tourists, but critics say they haven’t helped working-class families.
Is New York becoming a luxury item?
Joseph Viteritti, chair of Hunter College’s Urban Affairs & Planning Department.
The administration doesn’t put much stock in that criticism.
A growing city is a good thing,” Burden says.
Indeed, the administration often works hand in hand with community groups on many improvements like parks and plazas, says Bruce Berg, a political science professor at Fordham University.
Those groups, now that they’re mobilized, could continue to demand similar efforts under Bloomberg’s successor.
That’s a notion echoed by Sadik-Khan, who says that in many cases the transformations happening in New York are more of a response to the wants and needs of residents than the product of anyone’s political agenda.
That may be true.
But there’s still a sense among many observers that it will be difficult for any successor to match Bloomberg’s impact on the overall look and feel of New York City.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio exits a subway train while on his way to a news conference in New York September 25, 2014.
Reuters  - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to expand the city s living wage measure to include thousands of additional workers, as well as increase the amount workers are paid under the law, the New York Times reported on Monday.
De Blasio will sign an executive order on Tuesday to make the change, which his administration estimated could extend coverage to 18,000 workers over the next five years, the newspaper said on its website.
90 an hour, the paper said.
The planned action follows moves by several cities to raise wages for workers at the bottom of the pay scale.
25 an hour by 2017.
During his campaign for mayor last year, de Blasio railed against economic inequality in America s most populous city.
We cannot continue to allow rampant and growing income inequality,  de Blasio told the paper.  Every tool counts.
The mayor s executive order would cover employees of commercial tenants in development projects that take in more than $1 million in city subsidies, the paper said.
The 18,000 workers who would be covered represent about 70 percent of all jobs at businesses that will get financial help from the city s Economic Development Corporation, it added.
The city s living wage law was passed in 2012, and officials told the newspaper that it applied to about 1,200 jobs.
10 an hour, from $8 now, and allow New York City and other areas to set it 30 percent higher.
If approved by the state legislature, the plan could allow de Blasio to match the minimum wage to the living wage.

NEW YORK — Bright autumn sunshine spilled over the red-striped awning of the Meatball Shop in the West Village on Saturday afternoon.
Inside the restaurant, a dozen photographers and journalists elbowed each other for room, waiting for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to make his appearance.
As is the habit of politicians in times of public crisis, the mayor was trying to allay fears of Ebola by eating in the restaurant in which Craig Spencer had eaten just four days earlier.
De Blasio had already ridden the subway lines that Spencer had taken Tuesday and Wednesday, so lunch at the Meatball Shop with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and New York City’s health commissioner, Mary Bassett, was, shall we say, next on the menu.
It hardly seemed necessary.
As he strode in past a phalanx of photographers and sat at a small table in the back, de Blasio could see that the place — despite having been closed for a health inspection Thursday — was jumping.
When it reopened Friday night, there was a line waiting down Greenwich Avenue, according to the shop’s owner, Daniel Holzman.
Ebola in New York City might have been big news elsewhere, but it hadn’t set off cries of Armageddon among most Manhattanites.

25, 2014 From left, Daniel Holzman, co-owner of the Meatball Shop; New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio; his wife, Chirlane McCray; and New York City Health Commissioner Mary Bassett talk at the restaurant where Craig Spencer, an Ebola patient, ate before he became ill with the virus.
This doctor did the responsible thing, and as soon as he had a fever he called someone,” said Joe Farmarco, who lives a block away from Spencer.
How it’s supposed to be is occupying everyone from the White House to Harlem, but while the debate continues over whether health-care workers returning from West Africa should be quarantined, many of those who live near Spencer or who frequent the places he visited in the hours leading up to his hospitalization say they are not afraid of Ebola and are leaving the hysteria to others.
Spencer’s neighborhood in particular appeared unshaken.
In Hamilton Heights on Friday morning, the crowd standing sentinel outside his apartment building included nary a neighborhood resident — just a gaggle of TV technicians and well-coiffed broadcasters with TV trucks.
On Saturday at the Meatball Shop, a young woman who works in the area said she was not at all flustered when she heard that an Ebola victim had spent 40 minutes in the restaurant several days earlier.
I mean, I’m not really scared because I know that there’s such a slim chance of contracting the virus,” Emilia Navarro said.
When Spencer had finished his meal at the restaurant on Tuesday, he sauntered north to the High Line, the green space built on the tracks of an old, elevated freight train.
He stopped briefly at the Blue Bottle Coffee stand above W.
16th Street , then walked north on the High Line, past the Delaney Barbecue Smokeline, past Terroir on the Porch, which sells beer and wine, and past a haunted house being prepared near the High Line for Halloween.
On Friday afternoon, Erik Jacobsen, in white tie and tails, played his cello nearby, although the Allemande from Bach’s Suite No.
1 could barely be heard above the sound check at the haunted house.
Jacobsen said he was a “realist” about Ebola.
It’s inevitable,” he said.
On Tuesday, about a dozen blocks farther north, Spencer left the High Line, walked eastward, then hopped onto the No.
1 train and rode it to the 145th Street subway stop, two blocks from his apartment.
Community Supported Agriculture farm share.
At 5:30, along with two friends, he headed for the Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, taking the A Train south and then catching the L to Brooklyn.
On Friday, around the same time, Kate Paulin was riding the L toward Williamsburg with her Boston Terrier, named Bronx.
Paulin, who has lived in New York for 10 years, sounded philosophical about the risk of catching Ebola.
If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be,” she said.
I’m from the Midwest.
When Spencer and his friends exited the subway at Bedford Avenue, they walked about a dozen blocks to the Gutter bowling alley, barely discernible on a dark street of former warehouses.
Just a Coca-Cola sign with the single word “Bowl” hangs over the entrance.
It was closed Friday night and wasn’t scheduled to reopen until health officials had the hipster bowling alley-bar-music venue disinfected.
On Friday morning, according to people who work in the area, city officials handed out fliers near the bowling alley.
Ebola fever and what you should do if you visited West Africa within the past 21 days and develop a high temperature.
When Spencer was at the bowling alley two days earlier, he called for an Uber taxi to pick him up.
Faisal Zaman, who was driving an Uber taxi in the same area, said Friday that he had not heard about Spencer or Ebola.
Originally from Pakistan, Zaman expressed concern for the physician but not for himself or his 2014 Toyota Camry.
I clean my car every second day with disinfectant wipes,” he said, brandishing a large plastic carton he keeps in the front seat.
Taxis, cars and trucks hurtled past the Meatball Shop all day Saturday, and the traffic did not come to a standstill when the mayor stopped in for a bite.
He ordered a root beer and four chicken meatballs with tomato sauce while a dozen photographers leaned across tables taking pictures of the smiling mayor and his guests.
He said that New Yorkers were resilient and that if they were hungry Saturday night, they all should visit the Meatball Shop.
No one asked whether he had enjoyed his meal.
But one of his aides hurriedly scooped up the single remaining meatball in his boss’s dish and deposited it in a small take-out box, to be eaten later.

NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to get rid of the horse-drawn carriages that have been a fixture in Central Park and Midtown for about 150 years.
NYC s Mayor de Blasio wants to replace the horse-drawn carriages with electric cars.
Horse-drawn carriages line Central Park South in New York City.
Almost since the 1857 beginnings of Central Park, New York s horse-drawn carriages have guided tourists and others through the park and downtown streets of the city.
But now, the city s 220 horse-drawn hansom cabs could be headed in the same direction as the Knickerbocker telephone exchange and B.
Altman s department store.
New York s new mayor, Bill de Blasio, insists that carriages that typically carry passengers through the hills and valleys of the park and along streets as far south as 34th Street have got to go.
They are inhumane and outdated, he says.
We are going to quickly and aggressively move to make horse carriages no longer a part of the landscape in New York City,  de Blasio said during a Dec. 30 press conference at a middle school.  They re not humane.
They re not appropriate to the year 2014.
It s over.
The mayor wants to replace the horses and carriages with electric cars that have a vintage appearance, a move that de Blasio says will be good for the environment and help the drivers stay employed.
Central Park.
Wilson first began tending to horses in his native St.
Lucia.
The proposal has been a hot topic around the Big Apple since de Blasio smost emphatic insistence that he would get rid of the horse-drawn carriages.
This is not the first time someone or a group has spoken out against them, but de Blasio is the highest-ranking New Yorker to take on the tourist attraction.
The debate pits de Blasio and supporters of a group called New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets, or NYCLASS against the carriage drivers and others who want the carriages to stay.
The City Council would have to approve de Blasio s proposal.
The drivers say the mayor and NYCLASS are way off base and that removing the horses and carriages would be like stripping the city of part of its personality.
The rides, which cost about $165 for 45 minutes  or $50 for 20 minutes, are on many tourists  bucket lists, they said.
Many people get engaged in the carriages, and celebrities from athletes to Dr.
Phil have made it a point to take a ride when in New York, they said.
Horses and carriages upholstered in felt and leather began clip-clopping through Central Park in 1858,according to the Horse and Carriage Association of New York City.
Images of people riding in the decorated carriages have appeared in movies and on greeting cards.
On a typical day in New York, drivers gather on Central Park South across from the Plaza Hotel, feeding and grooming their horses and waiting for customers.
Many of the drivers do the work because they grew up with horses, says Stephen Malone, a driver and a spokesman for the Horse and Carriage Association of New York City.
Malone s father began tending horses after coming to the United States fromIreland.
Malone has been driving the carriages since 1987.
Malone says.
Malone, 44.
Driver Peter Wilson grew up with horses in St.
Lucia and also loves his work.
He doesn t know what he will do to support his wife and three children if the mayor s plan makes it through the council.
He scoffed at the mayor s electric car proposal.
Wilson, 41, of Brooklyn, adding that he thinks it will worsen the city s notorious traffic problems.
Over the years, the public s love affair with the horses has been occasionally soured by word of a horse dying in the heat or running amok after becoming frightened in city traffic.
In 2007, a City Council member introduced a bill to ban the horses.
The debate heated during de Blasio s campaign, during which he promised to rid the city of the carriages.
NYCLASS executive director Allie Feldman.
In response to the inhumane claims, the drivers say they treat the horses well and must follow the regulations of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Department of Health, the Police Department and park rangers.
They also must have certificates from the Department of Health, which requires biannual checkups, and licenses from the Department of Consumer Affairs, Malone says.
Malone says.
Tourists, in the meantime, say they don t know the details of the debate, but know that the attraction is on their list of NYC things to do.

WASHINGTON,  January 1, 2014 — Comrade Bill De Blasio was sworn in this morning as the Mayor of New York City.
Comrade” is the right title for the new mayor.
De Blasio is an unrepentant Marxist, though he does not like to use that term.
De Blasio is the guy who was cheering for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s while real Americans were trying to free that nation from Marxist tyranny.
De Blasio is the comrade who showed his solidarity with communism in 1991 by taking his honeymoon to Cuba.
Yes, while much of the world was being liberated from communist oppression, De Blasio did his part to support communism by going on a honeymoon in communist Cuba.
Any bets on whether he tried to visit political prisoners in Castro’s jails?
He is dictating a group of people out of their jobs.
These are the iconic horse drawn carriages in New York.
A few days ago at a press conference he said, “We are going to get rid of the horse carriages.
That is it.
Comrade De Blasio has spoken.
New York doesn’t need a legislative body like the city counsel.
They have a dictator now.
Of course, Michael Bloomberg, the outgoing Mayor had his own delusions of dictatorial grandeur too.
Comrade De Blasio says one of his top priorities is income inequality.
Of course, he is going to approach it from the Marxist point of view.
So his plans will include dictating income equality.
Never mind the fact that the Marxist idea of income redistribution has never worked.
Marxists never let the fact their ideas don’t work get in the way of trying to implement them.
Their definition of the oppressors is those who are successful but are not members of their party.
The end result is poverty.
Conservatives want to end income inequality as well, but conservative have a much better idea.
Comrade De Blasio wants to take New York back in time to the 70’s.
His policies will make New York an unsafe place, where criminals rule.
They will bankrupt the city and make poverty skyrocket.
When New York City goes bankrupt, the Republicans should let it fail.
Far too often the GOP comes in as the savior of socialism.
All the Republicans want to do is bail out the socialists.
Let them fail.
Let New York City fail.
The dirty secret in America right now is that the only thing that is keeping most major American cities from going into bankruptcy is they are subsidized by the Federal Government.
These major cities, all of whom have left wing mayors, have destroyed their tax bases.
They have pandered to the unions and to the constituencies of the left and spent money they don’t have so they can maintain power.
The successful have fled to the suburbs, as have many businesses.
Unfortunately, thanks to federal government spending, those who have fled to red counties and red states are still forced to subsidize the failure of the far left.
Almost every major American city is only a few steps behind Detroit.
Republicans should just let Detroit go out of business.
Something will arise out of the ashes of Detroit and replace it.
Even now, entrepreneurship is working in Detroit.
From bus tours to urban exploration, these tours are a booming business.
Perhaps ten years from now, there will be tours of the ruins of New York.
If New York fails, businesses and people will relocate to places where business and employment are welcome.
For Republicans, don’t bail New York out.
Let it and its communist Mayor fail.

Judson Phillips is the founder of Tea Party Nation, one of the largest Tea Party Groups in the country and the number one national tea party site on the Internet.
A lawyer by profession, Judson has been involved in politics since his teens.
Ronald Reagan inspired me,” he says.
Judson became involved in the Tea Party movement in February 2009 after hearing Rick Santelli’s rant on CNBC.
I heard there was going to be a Tea Party in Chicago inspired by Santelli, but didn’t know if anyone was doing a rally in Nashville where I was based.
Finally I emailed Michelle Malkin and asked her if there was a Tea Party in Nashville.
The first Tea Party in Nashville was held late February 2009 which drew a crowd of about 600.
Judson then organized the Tax Day Tea Party in Nashville, which drew over 10,000 people into downtown.
It was at this time that Tea Party Nation was formed.
Later that year, Judson decided to bring activists from across the country together, so he organized the first National Tea Party Convention in February 2010, which featured Alaska’s former Governor and Republican Vice Presidential Nominee, Sarah Palin as it’s keynote speaker.
He currently manages the Tea Party Nation website, writes several daily columns and is working on more projects than any one person should.
He is a frequent guest on cable and broadcast news shows, including on Fox, MSNBC, CNN and others.

De Blasio vs.
New York’s mayor takes on charter schools, and the national education debate hangs in the balance.
New York City s first lady Chirlane McCray and Mayor Bill de Blasio laugh during a roundtable discussion with parent bloggers in the Blue Room of City Hall on March 7, 2014.
While running for New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio could count on applause for attacking unpopular charter school co-locations, where charters that need space are squeezed into public school buildings alongside other schools.
Instead of extolling the promise of the charters, de Blasio provided a spine-stiffening defense of the “common” school, and his base ate it up: The unions loved it, parents whose kids were not in charters loved it, and many of de Blasio’s fellow Park Slope progressives loved it.
De Blasio went on to win more than 73 percent of the vote and was sworn into office with a mandate to lead.
So the new mayor must be feeling whiplash after the outcry that met him as he began to carry out a popular campaign pledge: slow down the charter co-locations and shift more money to traditional public schools.
That the charter community opposed the mayor wasn’t a surprise.
It was their political strength, organization, and popularity that caught de Blasio off guard.
From the rhetoric , you’d think de Blasio had personally bounced kids out of charter schools across all five boroughs.
In fact, in his first executive action on the issue, he blocked only three expansions, but in the process managed to anger charter supporters with his tactics and allowed centrist Democrats such as Gov.
Andrew Cuomo to score points by portraying him as an ideologue.
De Blasio also finds himself in a pretty lonely situation: By going after the charters, he is attacking one of the most promising urban school reform strategies available to Democratic mayors across the country these days, and he’s doing it without offering a clear alternative.
De Blasio’s not completely on his own.
He’s part of the national “pushback” movement against school reform, which saw the progressive mayor’s election as validation of its views.
Charter schools are a high-profile target of these anti-reform activists, but they are also fighting against standardized testing, the new Common Core standards, teacher evaluations based on student outcomes, and reforms to teacher tenure and pay.
In other words, most of the popular ideas to improve schools today.
Overall, the pushback movement is still more noise than signal, but in de Blasio it has found a high profile elected official who embraces its cause and takes its advice.
However, if he can’t wring real academic gains out of the traditional public schools he’s favoring, he’ll deal it a high-profile setback.
Unfortunately for the movement so far, de Blasio is proving to have two political left feet.
Wasn’t de Blasio supposed to be the champion of improving education for have-not children?
The mayor’s first misstep was going after one specific charter network , Success Academy, run by Eva Moskowitz, a former city council member who has clashed with de Blasio in years past over city education policies.
He singled out Moskowitz on the campaign trail with harsh personal rhetoric.
There’s no way in hell that Eva Moskowitz should get free rent” was a favorite line.
At a teachers union event last spring he went even further , saying it’s “time for Eva Moskowitz to stop having the run of the place.
She has to stop being tolerated, enabled, supported.
De Blasio and his schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, developed a four-point evaluation system for deciding which charter seats to block.
It sounded sensible but had a serious flaw: It put only Success Academy schools in the crosshairs, and the criteria were not about school quality.
The fallout from that misstep was immediate.
Among the 870 Success Academy seats blocked was a modest 194-student expansion for Success Academy students in Harlem to move into a new middle school.
That triggered days of searing press coverage pointing out that those 194 students, all low-income minorities, were coming from a school, Success Academy 4, that killed it on the new state test scores , with 80 percent of the students passing the math test, and 59 percent the English test.
S.
149, where 5 percent of students passed the math test, and 11 percent the English test .
In Albany, Cuomo was more than ready to grab the low-hanging political fruit left by the mayor and position himself as the foremost elected education reformer in the state while bolstering his national credentials.
Cuomo’s instincts are generally reformist—he’s also a smart enough politician to know that what gets applause in Park Slope can be political kryptonite in the rest of the country.
He made a boisterous appearance before a Moskowitz pro-charter rally in Albany to tell charter parents he has their back.
The rally drowned out the mayor’s efforts to get Albany to focus on preschool expansion and, with his approval ratings tumbling into the 30s after just a few weeks on the job, de Blasio effectively cried uncle late last week.
His schools chancellor Fariña flip-flopped on the co-location decision, saying she would find seats for the 194-student expansion elsewhere so that the school could operate .

De Blasio appears to be ruling out strategies used by fellow Democratic mayors.

Mayor Angel Taveras.
All support cooperation with charter schools and ideas at odds with de Blasio’s.
In Denver, Hancock endorsed the “reformers” at recent school board elections, all of whom won.
Denver is closing low-performing schools and doubling the number of charter schools.
What charters give,” Hancock told us in an interview “is a capability to be more nimble.
Denver schools Superintendent Tom Boasberg, who draws strong support from Hancock, entered into a compact with local high-performing charters: We will give you space if you take a fair share of special-education students, agree to a common application process, and, most importantly, act as collaborators when you get space in our buildings.
Creativity like this makes Denver a darling of education analysts, but politicians get it, too.
Another fan of Denver-style solutions is Sacramento’s Johnson, who is closely watching New York developments.
New York s charters are stronger collectively than charter schools in many other states.
Winning an election on a platform of income inequality, as de Blasio did, should be an ideal jumping-off point for pursuing greater equity in education, Johnson says.
That includes great preschools, as advocated by de Blasio, but goes far beyond, Johnson told us.
Mayors have to support any schools serving poor and minority students well.
There aren’t enough of those schools.
And charter schools, said Johnson, have to be in the mix.
Not all mayors.
De Blasio says nothing about compacts and collaboration.

About the only school improvement initiative de Blasio and his chancellor have unveiled is a vow to talk nicer to teachers and principals .

Just a few months ago Moskowitz couldn’t buy good publicity and even leaders in the charter community privately griped about her.
Now, after she stood up to de Blasio, some New York political observers are already talking about her as a viable mayoral candidate in the next election.
Cuomo, meanwhile, was viewed skeptically by many in the education reform community.
Now he’s beloved for siding so strongly with the charter parents against the mayor.
Besides making new political foes, de Blasio is exposing the growing rift over education policy among Democrats.
The party’s progressive wing views government ownership and control as the touchstones of common education.
Schools are considered public if they’re run by school districts  ideally with unionized teachers  and private if they’re not, even if they’re operated by idealistic nonprofits.
Progressives see teacher evaluations as a backdoor way to rid the system of expensive veteran teachers.
Centrists see effective teacher evaluations as key in a labor-intensive field like education.
Progressives see standardized testing as a strategy to discredit public schools.
Centrists see accountability as necessary in improving them.
These are not academic debates.
At stake is what comes next after two decades of progress improving American schools.
Neither faction in the education dispute has an interest in peddling good news so you don’t often hear about it in the toxic back and forth of education politics, but schools are doing better now with a more diverse group of students than they ever have.
Scores on the National Assessment of Education Progress—a no-stakes test given to students across the country—continue to rise, especially for disadvantaged students.
High-school graduation rates are higher than they’ve ever been.
Plenty more remains to be done, especially in urban and rural communities, but the progress is real and stems from bipartisan ideas and education reforms in states and from Washington.
The debate now is over what to do for the next generation of education reform.
Most American parents know nothing at all about Bill de Blasio, but they should.
The charter fight is a test case for both sides—can progressives push the charters back or are the reformers too strong now?
That question explains why so much energy was invested by both sides in a battle over a handful of schools.
If de Blasio can figure out how to regain momentum and harness progressive support to improve schools in New York City—taking the rough edges off of Mayor Bloomberg–era policies and hewing a different path from reformist Democratic mayors—that would change the terms of the national education debate.
If de Blasio can’t produce political and educational results, he will deal a devastating blow to the national anti-reform movement.
That’s why so much is riding on who comes out on top.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signs an executive order raising the living wage law on Sept.
30, 2014.
Labor advocacy groups welcomed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s signing on Tuesday of an executive order that will raise wages for thousands of New Yorkers, saying it will help people survive in the notoriously expensive city.
De Blasio said the order expands a 2012 “living wage” law that previously applied to only 1,200 New York jobs.
13 an hour for some workers.
The executive order will cover employees of commercial tenants in development projects that take in more than $1 million in city subsidies, The New York Times said Tuesday.
I think it’s a good step in the right direction for helping reduce income inequality,” said Cara Noel, spokeswoman for NYC Central Labor Council, adding that it will likely put some people on the path to becoming self-sufficient.
The term living wage refers to the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet needs that are considered basic.
De Blasio’s order comes amid a national movement of  low-wage workers  advocating for higher pay.
Blasio said Tuesday at a news conference, adding that he would also move to raise the state’s overall minimum wage.
50 for workers in New York City who already receive benefits including health insurance.
13, according to The New York Times.
76 in August 2014.
53, respectively.
Seattle  recently approved  a $15 minimum wage in June, and residents of San Francisco will vote on a $15 minimum in November.
Last year,  fast food workers  began a push for a $15 wage amid nationwide protests and strikes.
During de Blasio’s campaign for mayor last year, he condemned economic inequality in America’s most populous city.
We cannot continue to allow rampant and growing income inequality,” de Blasio told The New York Times.
Every tool counts.
The 18,000 workers who will now be covered under the expanded law represent 70 percent of all jobs at businesses that receive financial help from the city’s Economic Development Corporation, the paper added.
Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union, said in a news release.

New York mayor refuses to march in St.
S.
New York s newly elected mayor is already walking away from one of the city s oldest traditions: The St.
Patrick s Day Parade.
Bill de Blasio will become the first mayor in decades to sit out the March 17 amble along Fifth Avenue.
Blasio on Tuesday during an unrelated press conference at City Hall.
De Blasio opposed a ban on gay pride signs or banners at the parade.
The St.
Patrick s Day Parade committee allows gay people to march, but argues that banners celebrating homosexuality would divert the parade s focus of honoring Irish heritage.
While both his predecessors Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani participated in the parade, de Blasio did not march in the parade even when in the roll of public advocate,  NBC New York  reported.
The Empire State Pride Agenda, a New York civil rights and advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender New Yorkers, commended the mayor s decision.
New York City has long celebrated the myriad and colorful intersectionalities of our identities, and we’re a great city for that very reason.
No LGBT New Yorker should be denied the opportunity to fly the colors of the Irish and Rainbow flags simultaneously, to proudly represent all aspects of our city s heritage,” the group’s executive director, Nathan M.
Schaefer, said in a press release.

De Blasio was raised Catholic but has said he does not belong to any church.
The mayor, a Democrat who campaigned on bringing more equality to the city, also said Tuesday that he won t heed activists  call to ban city workers from marching while wearing their uniforms.
Less than a year after leaving office, and despite having promised to dedicate his life to philanthropy, Mike Bloomberg returned to the helm of his namesake company.
With an 88% stake in Bloomberg LP, the former Mayor of New York is back at a firm that is drastically different from where he left it: with annual revenues that will top $9 billion in 2014 and a massive concentration of its profits coming from the terminal business.
Bloomberg displaced his former Deputy Mayor, Daniel Doctoroff, who as CEO pushed for diversification, despite pushing for Doctoroff to remain on board.
Bloomberg, who was born in Boston and has degrees from Johns Hopkins and Harvard Business School, got his start on Wall Street in 1966, when he was hired for an entry level job at Salomon Brothers.
Bloomberg, who ran New York City for 12 years, rose to become head of equity trading and then information services, before being let go in 1981 when the firm was acquired.
Bloomberg, along with Tom Secunda, Chuck Zegar, and Duncan MacMillan, founded Bloomberg LP, and sold their first systems to Merrill Lynch.

What s with the knife and fork, de Blasio?
In this image taken from video and provided by New York City Hall, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio eats pizza with a fork at Goodfellas Pizza in the Staten Island borough of New York, Friday, Jan.
10, 2014.
Just ten days into his tenure, Bill de Blasio is already facing a scandal that has many New Yorkers questioning whether he is truly fit for the job.
The neophyte mayor, who acknowledged on the campaign trail that he was a fan of the reviled Boston Red Sox, was at a Staten Island’s “Goodfellas Pizza” when he picked up the cutlery, the Daily News reports.
Ya know, I think he’s just trying to be polite,” owner Scot Costentino told reporters.
De Blasio, who has played up his Italian roots in the past, said he was eating his smoked mozzarella and sausage pizza — thin-sliced in the Italian style — as the Italians do.

Michael Bloomberg to return as head of financial news company he founded in 1981, saying he could not resist its lure.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is to return as head of Bloomberg, the data and financial news company he founded in 1981, replacing Daniel Doctoroff who has decided to step aside, the company has said.
The privately held company, in which Bloomberg is the majority shareholder, said on Wednesday that Doctoroff would step aside as president and chief executive at the end of the year.
Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at more than $32bn, had expected to spend much of his time on philanthropic efforts after leaving office in late 2013, the Reuters news agency reported.
Those efforts have included fights for public health and gun control.
I have gotten very involved in the company again and that led to Dan coming to me recently to say he thought it would be best for him to turn the leadership of the company back to me.
In a statement, Bloomberg said he never intended to return to his company after 12 years as mayor.
But after reacquainting himself with its operations, he said, he could not resist its lure.
Bloomberg, whose company has grown to employ more than 15,000 people in 73 countries and has made him a billionaire.
Doctoroff became Bloomberg president in 2008 and chief executive in July 2011.
4bn to more than $9bn, he said in a memo to the company s employees.
Doctoroff, 56, a former New York deputy mayor in the statement.
Simply put, while Mike never intended to come back full time, after he left City Hall and started to get to know the company again, he rediscovered what an exciting and incredible place this is.
During Doctoroff s tenure at the company, the numbers of subscriptions for its terminals has grown from 273,000 to 321,000, the company said in a statement.
Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for another opportunity, but would focus more of his time on non-profit activities.
He also accepted Bloomberg s invitation to join the board of the Bloomberg Philanthropies.
Bloomberg started the company using a $10m severance package he received after he was laid off after investment bank Salomon Brothers had been acquired.
He had headed equity trading at Salomon.

ON NOVEMBER 5th the keys to New York’s City Hall were returned to Democratic hands after 20 years of Republican or Independent leadership.
Bill de Blasio, New York’s public advocate, soundly defeated Joe Lhota, his Republican opponent, in New York’s mayoral election.
The lopsided result  73% to 24%  was not unexpected.
Mr de Blasio had been leading the polls since summer.
During his victory speech in Brooklyn, the new mayor-elect bragged that New Yorkers had  chosen a progressive path.  Why have New Yorkers voted for a Democratic mayor ?
The move is a decidedly different path from the one the city has been on since 1993.
Rudy Giuliani, who ran for president as a Republican in 2008, helped push back crime during his eight years in office.
For the past 12 years the city has been managed effectively by Michael Bloomberg , a Republican-turned Independent who tended to govern above the political fray.
He changed the way the city was run, relying on statistics more heavily.
Mr Bloomberg also brought stability after the September 11th attacks.
Later, he helped diversify the economy, making it less reliant on the finance industry.
On his watch New York seemed to become a city of bold projects again.
Fully 40% of the city was  re-zoned , while an applied-science campus was developed in hopes of creating a technology boom to rival Silicon Valley.
Polls show more than half of voters thought Mr Bloomberg did a good job, but Mr de Blasio’s crushing win shows New Yorkers wanted change.
Mr Lhota, who would have built on Mr Bloomberg’s successes and is already a proven manager, did not appeal.
There was a certain amount of Bloomberg fatigue in the city.
Liberals were upset by the increasing use of  stop-and-frisk  anti-crime tactics and by and by growing income inequality.
But despite Mr de Blasio’s Bloomberg-bashing during the campaign, his victory is in a way a return to New York City’s blue roots.
New York has not voted for a Republican for president since Calvin Coolidge in 1924; Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.
The past five mayoral elections were really aberrations, thinks Mr Bloomberg.
In those elections, New Yorkers voted out of fear.
When Mr Giuliani was first elected, crime was pervasive.
In 2001, when Mr Bloomberg was running, the city had just been attacked by terrorists.
For young New Yorkers today, a scary New York is an alien notion.
Because of the spread of gentrification many young hipsters now live in neighbourhoods once considered tough if not outright dangerous.
Mr de Blasio is about as left-wing as one can get.
He ran Hillary Clinton’s 2000 senate campaign.
Since then he has been a pretty progressive voice on the city council and as public advocate.
He will be the country’s most liberal-leaning big-city mayor.
In his victory speech Mr de Blasio promised that  progressive changes won’t happen overnight, but they will happen.  Despite this rhetoric it might do well for Mr de Blasio to remember something Fiorello LaGuardia once said.
LaGuardia, mayor during the 1930s and 1940s, was one of the most successful and popular New York mayors.
At the end of the day, New Yorkers want potholes filled, their streets ploughed when it snows and their rubbish picked up.
Reader comments are listed below.

That is a strange use of  yet .
Normally it connects two statements that at first glance may appear to be at odds, not ones that make you think  duh .
Wow, next time when I choose a contractor or architect for my house, I ll make sure I know how well they can dance and talk about inanities than whether they can actually do the job well.
I ve rarely disagreed as much with an  explanation .
The main driver was the sense the city is no longer home to New Yorkers but to real estate investors from abroad and to the coterie of services arranged around the really rich.
The essence of NYC has always been that in a city of great riches you could also find cheap, good places to eat and shop.
That remains but New Yorkers don t like this direction because it feels like the city is being made into something that is not NYC, that is not full of vitality.
No one expects the police to change their policing methods dramatically.
Or for zoning to revert suddenly.
Or for greater protections on rent controlled properties.
But they don t want to lose their sense of the city.
Remember, an attraction of Bloomberg was that he was himself a plutocrat but also a populist.
It wasn t exactly conservative to insist on a soda size ban.
That strain of populism is important in big city mayors, from Bloomberg through Koch back to LaGuardia and Jimmy Walker before that.
The NYTimes editors should be proud of themselves.
For weeks they ve been giving as much free press to de Blasio as they could, front page news everyday, raising his profile, while nary a mention of his opponent.
Most people probably didn t even know who he was running against.
This is a mayor handpicked by the NYTimes.
New Yorkers have either forgotten or didn t know about what NYC was like in the 80s, crime ridden, filthy streets, stinky subway stations.
You couldn t even walk down 42nd St.
Broadway was downright grungy.
They re taking the NYC of today with good economy and low crime for granted.
Perhaps it really is Shanghai s time to take over as the new financial capital of the world.
What a shame.
NYC didn t know they had a good thing going.
I suppose that s one way to look at it, though I would be absolutely shocked if de Blasio turns out to be competent.
Name one liberal Democrat who can actually lead and manage.
The more liberal they are, the more incompetent they are.
Limousine liberals  of which there is a high concentration in NYC  believe that you can have low crime, efficient services, and a livable city while still having a compassionate, generous government which acts first to defeat inequality and avoids offending any visible pressure group, while funding the lot by increasing taxes on whichever group is one step higher than them on the income scale.
They teach each other this paradigm, and each new generation needs to be confronted with its impractability by a live demonstration.
Blasio will restore NYC back to its glory days of the 70s and 80s, when guys with big afros and bell bottoms ran around pedaling drugs without fear in broad day light.
Electing a liberal Democratic mayor is like a booster shot for New York.
Once the populace rejects him for a surplus of ideology and a deficit of management competence, it will be vaccinated against his type for a generation.
It appears the Dinkins booster shot has worn off.
New Yorkers like the idea of having a liberal Democrat for a mayor, but when push comes to shove what they really demand is a competent manager for a large and complex city.
In contrast to federal politics, at the local level Republicans tend to be the practical realists, and the Democrats the pie-in-the-sky idealists.
It is possible that DeBlasio will be a competent manager, but he doesn t have the resume for it, and his campaign suggests that he won t focus on that aspect of the job.
They want higher crime rates, which will happen when hizzoner stops the NYPD from conducting any more stop and frisk searches.
La Guardia was a Republican.
As for DeBlasio, he was my councilmember, so I have been hearing about him for years, and yet I have no idea what he stands for.
Except that whatever you stand for, he probably seems to agree with it.
What does progressive mean?
Not what it mean when the term was phrased.
Right now you have the executive financial class, which control Washington, the political union class, which controls city halls and man state capitals, and the serfs.
The bonus rich and the pension rich have been getting richer, and everyone else has been getting poorer as the future is sold off.
Back in the day, being a  progressive  mean being for the serfs and the common future -- bashing monopolistic trusts and expensive and unproductive political machines alike.
Based on the actions of those who describe themselves using that word, I don t think that is still the case.
Having lived in NY in its bad days, sometime the people forget how good they had it.
DiBlasio has only worked in government never business.
So his answer is to tax the rich, to pay for everything.
He will have zero relationship with business and business no longer has to be in NY to be successful.
We have the internet.
So look for more people of wealth to pack it in.
Liberals can only operate with other people money.
The Economist argues that de Blasio s election is a response to the wealth gap and perceived inequities and incompetence of Republican policies.
It s important to note that the past 20 years of Republican administration of NYC was a reaction to the populist policies of Mayor Lindsay and his ilk, who subverted New York s financial stability in pursuit of a socialistic ideal of income and racial equality.
The massive public housing  some of it forcibly inserted into previously stable and safe middle class neighborhoods , disruptive school busing across disparate neighborhoods and economic classes, the wholesale release of the mentally ill onto the streets, the get-out-of-jail-free cards distributed liberally to thugs and gangsters, the downgrading of law and order in favor of liberal ideals, all brought the city to the brink.
The middle and upper classes who paid most of the taxes fled to the suburbs.
It took conservative policies and old fashioned policing to clean things up, not without a few bumps in the road but with mostly great success.
Now New York City appears to have come full circle, bringing back into power the kind of left wingers who were responsible for its permanent decline, who opposed its partial renaissance, and who would take New York back to a dark place of strikes, tolerated levels of brutal street violence, and crippling taxation on the very businesses which provide employment and tax revenue to keep the whole machine running.
The policies espoused by de Blasio and Lhota are breathtakingly different.
Blasio plans to raise taxes, while Lhota proposed cutting them.
Blasio plans to help the unions, while Lhota would have taken up the Giuliani mantle of keeping them in check.
Two more different politicians could hardly be imagined.
Lhota is a pro-choice social progressive, received the endorsements of the minority business associations, the Latino associations, some of the Jewish associations, is a Harvard grad and a Bronx native and a veteran of city governance.
His CV seemed perfect for the job, and instead New Yorkers went for the other guy.
I wish them luck; they re going to need a lot of it.
Is that why Republicans vote for garbage like Cruz, who can do the  I m a PURE Republican and you re not!  dance very well?
Its easy to be snide about Mayor Bloomberg who inherited wealth and decided to go into public service.
Some Republicans still believe in public service  government .
On the whole Bloomberg was a good man and true.
He interacted with all the components of the municipal order smoothly.
That doesn t mean I subscribe to his notions of semi-privatising services which overall, resemble reinventing the wheel of government.
The reign of Guiliani and Bloomberg saw the Big Apple become the playground of Central Perk singles,Sex & the City characters, Warehouse-conversion housed Wall Streeters, global elites serviced by armies of attendants and all manner of bearers.
A secure, civilised place excepting 9 11.
Surburbia in the City.
A cultured place though not as prominent and dominant as it once was.
An economically solvent place though 2008 was a wobbly time.
As for inequality, did NY lead or follow the rest of the world in that respect?
How do you gentrify inequality I wonder.
And yet again, spontaneous development by free agents is curtailed in favor of somebody s personal notions of  aest ethics, entirely ignoring the opportunity costs and big picture.
Bastiat rotates in his grave so fast, we could hook him up to a dynamo and solve the world s energy crisis forever.
What commenters may not see, out of their bias to living through the dark years of the 70s and 80s, is that there has been a fundamental change in the make-up of the big American cities.
It s hard to see a reversion to decay and crime when the two options are simply two sides of the same gentrification coin  to torture an analogy .
Thinkingaboot explains Toronto s Mayor.
W  journalist who wrote the article  Bloomberg was a life long Democrat that change parties in order to get on Mayoral ticket in 2001 since he couldn t as a democrat.
He only later moved to the independent ticket in 2007.
He wasn t popular with the liberal strong hold unions because he made business decisions  viewed as conservative in order to keep revenues even with expenses.
He changed zoning to diversify the economy and draw in international talent.
New York is an international city, cheap by comparison, which comes with sacrifices.
Those who don t like change are destine to wallow in their despair.
Google the  Churn  by the Dallas fed for more information about economic churn.
I question a man who uses the race card specifically with a touchy topic of stop & frisk.
De Blasio use of his bi-racial children in his ads raised a lot of questions and concerns.

Bill de Blasio discussing Ebola patient Dr.
Craig Spencer.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio held a press conference at the Office of Emergency Management in Brooklyn on Friday to discuss the Ebola patient diagnosed at Bellevue Hospital on Thursday.
Blasio said.
The patient, Dr.
Craig Spencer, had been treating Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the three countries in West Africa that has seen an epidemic of the disease.
He returned to New York on Oct.
17.
Ebola victims are only contagious to others when they begin experiencing symptoms.
De Blasio stressed the city s  disease detectives  were working to  retrace  Spencer s steps and evaluate locations he visited after he began feeling ill.
They also said his fiancee was under quarantine.
According to officials, Spencer visited three locations in Manhattan on Tuesday: the Highline Park, Blue Bottle coffee shop, which is in the park, and the Meatball Shop restaurant on Greenwich Ave.
On Wednesday, he went to The Gutter, a bowling alley in Brooklyn.
He took the subway to get there and returned home in an Uber cab.
Though Spencer traveled within the city, de Blasio stressed it would be difficult for him to have put others in danger.
De Blasio noted it is only  direct  contact with bodily fluids with an infected and contagious person that can spread Ebola.
Blasio said.
Ramanathan Raju, the chief executive of the New York City Health & Hospitals Cop oration, which operates Bellevue, said Spencer is in  stable  condition.

Raju said.

Pinching consumers won t help the taxi industry.
New York mayor Bill de Blasio thinks he’s doing the taxi cartel that runs the city’s famous yellow cabs a favor.
But actually he’s only making it easier for Uber, the car-service company that is the taxi industry’s nemesis, to justify its recently reported $10 billion valuation .
Unlike his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, who famously vowed to “fucking destroy” the incumbent taxi industry, de Blasio cozied up to the sector—and its hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations—during his mayoral run.
Now, he’s appointed one of his taxi fundraisers  to be a taxi regulator, and more importantly, held up plans to expand the city’s taxi fleet by an additional 6,000 new cabs.
The extra cabs would have been part of the “borough cab” program introduced by Bloomberg, which was designed to alleviate New York City’s congenital shortage of cabs outside downtown Manhattan.
The yellow cab industry opposes the borough cabs because they reduce the value of its monopoly.
This is much the same reason it opposes new entrants like Uber and other car services that use the internet to provide car service outside the regulated framework of the taxis.
He’s reinforcing Uber’s narrative that the current system is rigged against consumers, and companies like Uber are needed to disrupt it and meet the unmet demand.
And, in this case, Uber’s probably right.
And that’s really where New York’s government is failing.
It’s neither meeting the demand for paid car services by approving new cabs, nor is it creating a system whereby Uber, or its competitors Lyft and Sidecar, can safely fill the gap.
And, if the city ever does decide to start regulating the Ubers of the world, it will be easier for those companies to allege that the new rules are designed only to benefit incumbent taxi companies—and harder for de Blasio to convince the public otherwise.

Food Economy, in a food town like no other, can be an engine for growth.
Eliminate wage theft and support safe working conditions, availability of paid sick days - in lieu of ordered shift swaps, health benefits, and the right to organize for every City food chain worker.
5.
Food Governance in our City covers every segment of the food chain.

Support and fund an inclusive, participative process that engages New Yorkers from every food system intersection - public, private, not-for-profit, community production, processing, distribution, consumption, waste - to give them a voice in shaping our City’s food future.
The  New York City Food Forum  is a collaboration of more than 90 food-active organizations that have come together to achieve their shared vision of a better food future for every New Yorker.
In addition to working collectively, each NYCFF organization also works to advance the issues most aligned with its own focus and mission and may not subscribe to every position adopted by the NYCFF.
Together, these organizations reach tens of thousands of people through their respective outreach, education, programing, and advocacy efforts.

James J.
Walker, in full James John Walker, byname Jimmy Walker     born June 19, 1881, New York City—died Nov.
18, 1946, New York City , flamboyant mayor of New York City  1925–32 , a frequenter of Broadway theatre and the upper-class speakeasies, such as the Central Park Casino.
His administration was marred by corruption.
The son of Irish Catholic immigrants who lived in New York’s Greenwich Village , Walker attended Saint Francis Xavier College and graduated from New York Law School in 1904.
After graduation, however, he began frequenting Broadway’s theatres and vaudeville, writing popular songs and eventually marrying  in 1912  a musical comedy singer.
In that same year he was admitted to the New York State bar.
Already gravitating toward politics, he became a district captain and a member of the Assembly  1909  and, under the tutelage of Alfred E.
Smith , was elected to the State Senate  1914 .

The Mayor s Management Report  MMR , which is mandated by the City Charter, serves as a public report card on City services affecting New Yorkers.
The MMR is released twice a year.
The Preliminary MMR provides an early update of how the City is performing four months into the fiscal year, from July 1st through October 31st.
Beginning with the Fiscal 2013 Preliminary Mayor’s Management Report, the MMR has been restructured to focus on the goals that the agency intends to achieve during the fiscal year.
Each goal is accompanied by performance measures that quantify the agency’s progress toward achieving that goal.

The Mayor operates the executive branch of city government and oversees the day-to-day operations of all city departments.
The Mayor is also the president of the Jamestown Board of Public Utilities and chairman of the Jamestown Urban Renewal Agency by virtue of office.
Due to a change in the City Charter that was approved by the Jamestown City Council in 2002, the Mayor now drafts and submits to the Council an Executive Budget on a yearly basis.
Senior advisor Peter Ragone safeguards de Blasio’s progressive mantra, choreographs his press ops and shepherds him across political land mines.
Can the ‘guy in the shadows’ keep the mayor out of trouble?
Peter Ragone.
The mayor was about to meet the media for the first time since he returned from his vacation in Italy.
Just before he left, Staten Island resident Eric Garner had been placed in an apparent chokehold by police and died, for the crime of selling loose cigarettes.
It was Mr.
Ragone who suggested Mr.
Blasio lead his City Hall press conference the day after his return with the news of three wounded officers shot that day in Greenwich Village while trying to apprehend an accused child molester.
From there, he would work his way back to Garner.
The idea was to balance the simmering line between outrage in the same minority communities that elected Mr.
Blasio  Garner was black  and the police leaders who feel City Hall doesn’t respect cops.
It worked, at least for a moment.
While pitfalls remain, Mr.
Blasio earned early praise for his handling of a potentially defining controversy without alienating either side.
Mr.
Ragone, Mr.
He is the man the mayor turns to first for help in navigating the city’s ever-choppy political waters.
Peter instinctively knew what the breaking news was and what people needed to hear about,” said Rachel Noerdlinger, the chief of staff to Chirlane McCray and a former top aide to Rev.
Al Sharpton.
Mr.
Ragone, 44, is not the gray mandarin tugging at the strings of the gawky de Blasio puppet, dictating the mayor’s every move.
Rather, he’s more of a $212,614 consigliere, perhaps the most listened-to voice in Mr.
Blasio’s ear.
I have the greatest job in the world,” Mr.
Ragone told the Observer at a favorite downtown haunt, Ecco!
I actually wake up every day and think that: I have the greatest job in the world.
Mr.
Ragone is a regular at the old-school brass and mahogany eatery which looks like the sort of place where Fiorello La Guardia could have gnawed on veal chops.
Mr.
Ragone elected for the salad.
In person, he’s self-effacing, evincing the demeanor of a kid who stumbled into the greatest of all municipal candy stores, New York City.
The former Cuomo, Gore and Clinton operative has known Mr.
Blasio intimately since the 1990s, passing out leaflets for the Park Sloper’s first school board race in 1999 and lending advice from California when Mr.
Blasio tried and failed to become speaker of the City Council in 2005.
Figuratively, we’ve walked through fire together,” Mr.
Blasio said when introducing Mr.
Ragone at a January press conference.
Their biggest—and only—arguments are over baseball: Mr.
Blasio, a Massachusetts native, grew up a Red Sox fan and Mr.
Ragone is a Yankee diehard.
When Mr.
Ragone, in 2007, was profiled in the San Francisco Chronicle, Mr.
Blasio, a little-known Brooklyn city councilman at the time, was called to lend an effusive quote.
They are, in the words of Mr.
The duo can be found side-by-side at City Hall, swapping all the inside jokes you were never around for.
What Mr.
Ragone ultimately amounts to, beyond being one of Mr.
Blasio’s most trusted aides, is a field general guiding the likely eight-year battle Mr.
Blasio, a liberal Democrat, must wage to enact his far-reaching agenda.
Mr.
Ragone is helping to shape the long-term trajectory of the de Blasio administration, plotting attacks on issues like affordable housing construction and prekindergarten expansion in the months and years ahead.
He’s the keeper of the flame in terms of the mayor’s branding and overall strategy,” Ms.
Wolfe explained.
He is responsible for executing the mayor’s message every day.
In his own words, Mr.
Ragone’s principal job is to take the “long view” for the administration.
Getting a policy from the mayor’s brain through the government and then out into the public realm is actually a lot of work in a large organization,” he said.
Aides say the selection of venues for certain key press conferences—bill-signing ceremonies outside Grand Army Plaza or beneath Bushwick railroad tracks—are all suggested by Mr.
Ragone to reinforce Mr.
Blasio’s everyman image.
Any major rollout has to underscore the benign, yet crucial, Ragone-crafted mantra: progressive, effective, diverse.
He also helped shape Ms.
McCray’s image.
He has always encouraged us to look at the first lady as our best asset,” Ms.
Noerdlinger said.
Mr.
Ragone suggested Ms.
Ms.
McCray posts her own poetry and apparently candid shots of her family on the blog, furthering the aura of intimacy central to the mayor’s image.
Where Mr.
Ragone has also been helpful, administration observers say, is in forging Mr.
Blasio’s complex relationship with Gov.
Andrew Cuomo, a centrist Democrat unwilling to cede the spotlight to anyone, in particular a high-flying New York City mayor.
Mayor Bill de Blasio introduces Peter Ragone to the press in January.
On the day Mr.
Blasio traveled to Albany to rally for his pre-K plan, Mr.
Cuomo staged a massive rally for charter schools, hijacking the mayor’s media moment.
Never warm to the idea of publicly financed private schools proliferating in the city, Mr.
Blasio found himself in a flurry of stories that depicted Mr.
Cuomo as the ruthless yet brilliant tactician ably foiling the downstate lightweight.
In off the record conversations, Cuomo aides delighted in flaying Mr.
Blasio.
But Mr.
Blasio didn’t take the bait; he never had a bad word for the governor.
In the end, Mr.
Cuomo allotted Mr.
Blasio the money he needed to fund his campaign vow and the two have not crossed swords since.
Mr.
Ragone grew up in Merrick, a predominantly white, middle-class suburb on Long Island.
His parents divorced and he spent a good deal of his childhood in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where his mother lived.
He attended the State University of New York at Albany and leaped into the political fray post-college.
Eventually, he served as the New York press officer for the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, meeting a crack Democratic operative named Bill de Blasio.
I think people who tend to be good at this stuff don’t come up in a conventional way,” said Christopher Lehane, who served as Mr.
Gore’s press secretary during his 2000 presidential run.
He stumbled into the business: he began early on in the Cuomo world and was one of guys handed more and more responsibility in a campaign context.
Mr.
Ragone, still in his 20s, continued to rise.
He was appointed the national press secretary for Mr.
S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
It was at HUD where Mr.
Ragone reunited with Mr.
Blasio, who was HUD’s regional director for New York and New Jersey and several years away from becoming an elected official.
After a stint as a consultant on Mr.
Cuomo’s first and failed bid for governor in 2002, Mr.
Ragone was off to California, where he fell in with San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom.
Originally a campaign volunteer, he was hired when Mr.
Newsom became mayor and quickly climbed the ranks of the administration, becoming Mr.
He earns $118,468 a year, and many believe he is the most powerful member of the mayor’s staff,” the Chronicle wrote in 2007.
Mr.
Ragone gained a reputation as a controlling, details-obsessed aide.
Almost anything in Newsomland had to run through Mr.
Ragone.
He could be bumptious with San Francisco’s press corps.
He had a playbook he wanted to run.
There was a story a day.
He wanted the administration to show something was going on every day,” said Phil Matier, a political columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle.
Mr.
Newsom’s right-hand man would often call a reporter into his office, where he’d preach the Gospel of Gavin.
Mr.
Ragone had a habit of picking up a baseball bat and taking half swings.
It wasn’t menacing,” Mr.
Matier insisted.
For Mr.
Newsom himself, the intensity was refreshing.
Mr.
Ragone debuted weekly “whiteboard” sessions, laying down in fine detail what the new administration hoped to accomplish in coming weeks.
During rough patches, Mr.
Ragone could be surprisingly serene, ambling into tense staff meetings while calmly chewing his gum.
The more intense things were, the calmer he was,” Mr.
Newsom told the Observer.
Peter was never at his best when things were going perfectly well.
He felt he wasn’t as necessary … In New York, every damn day you have a crisis.
If Mr.
Newsom’s peak was the decision to marry same-sex couples in violation of California law, the valleys for the mayor and Mr.
Ragone came in quick succession a few years later.
In January of 2007, Mr.
Newsom revealed he had an affair with a staffer.
That same month, Mr.
Ragone finally admitted he had been defending his boss, on a variety of fronts, by posting comments to local blogs under the alias John Nelson.
At first, Mr.
Ragone indignantly told reporters that Mr.
Nelson was his friend.
No, they couldn’t meet him, but he stayed over at Mr.
A television reporter confronted Mr.
Ragone and in a cringeworthy clip immortalized on YouTube, Mr.
Ragone insists twice that he is “absolutely not” posting blog comments under phony names.
This Rita chick is kind of weird with her angry infatuation with gavin newsom,” Mr.
Ragone wrote in one thread as Mr.
Nelson, referring to a critical blogger at SFist, Gothamist’s San Francisco counterpart.
Repeated lying eventually gave way to the truth: he was posting under Mr.
Nelson’s name.
Mr.
Nelson, a real life friend, would later defend Mr.
It was a stupid thing to do at a time when that medium was completely new, and I made a mistake,” Mr.
Ragone said.
It’s made me even more careful than I was before that.
It was traumatic for me.
Was he worried that the controversy could ruin him permanently?
But I always thought, I always believed that you can make mistakes, learn from them, and move on … Gavin and I got closer after that.
Mr.
Newsom served two terms and eventually became California’s lieutenant governor in 2011.
Mr.
Ragone, post-Newsom, spent time in the lucrative private sector, taking a moment to found a start-up called Exiles Inc.
Think networking for Yankees fans in San Francisco .
When Mr.
Blasio won last year, Mr.
Ragone knew he wanted to go back East to work for one of his closest friends, now the most powerful man in New York City.
His wife and two children still live in San Francisco, though distance is not the only sacrifice he has had to make for his dream job.
Which means he may or may not last the full de Blasio ride, assuming he wins re-election in 2017.
I don’t know if I’ll be able to.
I love working for him and I love being around him and Chirlane,” he said.

New York City s 103rd mayor.
America’s Mayor: John V.
Lindsay and the Reinvention of New York examines the dramatic times and controversial tenure  1966-1973  of New York’s 103rd mayor.
The exhibition presents Lindsay’s efforts to lead a city amid the political and social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s; it also highlights Mayor Lindsay’s ambitious initiatives to redefine New York’s government, economy, culture, and urban design.
As a result of his commitment to civil rights and opposition to the Vietnam War, Lindsay emerged as a national figure in a troubled and exhilarating era.
At a time of exodus to the suburbs, he championed city life.
The exhibition explores the political and fiscal costs of his approach, particularly growing criticism from disaffected white ethnic voters and a city budget increasingly in debt.

The mayor has harsh words for Bill de Blasio, rebuts the charge that he’s in the tank for the wealthy, questions just how poor the poor really are, and considers  for the first time  what he might like named after him.
On August 6, I meet Mayor Bloomberg in the wide-open City Hall bullpen he installed as soon as he took office to re-create the collaborative corporate environment of his business empire.
It’s the middle of summer, with the mayoral race heating up, and he’s conferring with Deputy Mayor Patti Harris and glancing at the Bloomberg terminal at his desk.
I ask him what he’s monitoringlocal companies, he says, which he follows as economic barometers.
Many of which also happen to be run by his friends.
Times.
American Express would be on there.
Ken Chenault’s a friend, but also it’s a big employer in New York City.
If you want to know what’s happening, Chenault can tell you.
Another one which would be a good indicator is Macy’s.
The guy that runs it happens to be a golfing buddy, Terry Lundgren, but he can tell youthey have stores in all five boroughs, and out in the suburbs, and around the country.
Having climbed up the short stairway to a conference table, we begin the first of several conversations about his twelve unusual years in office, sitting beneath a countdown clock showing the time left in his mayoralty ticking away.
A common theme in the campaign to succeed you has been that you’ve governed primarily for the rich.
I’m fascinated by these commentsand it is just campaign rhetoricsuggesting that we haven’t done enough for the poor.
The truth of the matter is we’ve done a lot more than anybody else has ever done.
The average compensationincomefor the bottom 20 percent is higher than in almost every other city.
Of course, the average compensation for the top 20 percent is 25 percent higher than the next four cities.
But that’s our tax base.
If we can find a bunch of billionaires around the world to move here, that would be a godsend, because that’s where the revenue comes to take care of everybody else.
Who’s paying our taxes?
We pay the highest school costs in the country.
It comes from the wealthy!
5 billion budget for our Police Department.
We’re the safest big city in the countrystop me when you get bored with this!
Life expectancy is higher here than in the rest of the countrywho’s paying for that?
We want these people to come here, and it’s not our job to say that they’re over- or underpaid.
I might not pay them the same thing if it was my companymaybe I’d pay them more, I don’t know.
All I know is from the city’s point of view, we want these people, and why criticize them?
Wouldn’t it be great if we could get all the Russian billionaires to move here?
But isn’t there a point where the compensation has outstripped whatever civic contribution bankers make?
They are private institutionsmaybe public companies, but in the private ­sectorwho want to maximize their profits.
I assume they don’t deliberately overpay their employees, they pay what they think is necessary, and if one guy raises the ante, the other guy doesn’t have much choice.
So you don’t think the fact that the economic gap is increasing is a problem for the future of the city?
The question you’ve got to ask yourself is, are we spending money to help those that are struggling?
We spend $22,000 per year per student.
No other city in the country spends that.
We have a commitment to having a park within a ten-minute walk of everybody.
I don’t think any administration has done as much to help the whole spectrum of people who live here.
The truth of the matter is that there are more private-sector jobs in this city than ever before, and the people struggling at the bottom have more support than ever before.
We’ve created something like 300,000 jobs at the bottom end, where they are really needed.
We’re also working at the top, whether it’s the Cornell engineering campus or trying to help support big finance.
We’ve created a government that’s not based on special interests or who you know; it uses numbers to decide whether or not, in fact, people are getting this kind of service, need that kind of service.
People don’t rememberwhen Giuliani was going out and I was coming in, it was supposed to be the end of the world.
Nobody knew what a billionaire would do.
They thought I would destroy the city.
That did not happen.
Take a look at all the things we’ve doneinfrastructure, education, crime, helping the poor, cultural institutions.
The elitist thing that cultural institutions are only for certain peopleno!
We built small cultural institutions all around the cityfrom cultures you’ve never heard of.
In Kingston, a full time Mayor serves as Chief Executive Officer.
The mayoral term is four years.
As the top elected official, the Mayor oversees operation of the City, reviewing departmental specifics with all department heads.
He is responsible for the annual City budget which is presented to the Common Council for its review in October of each calendar year.
He also appoints commissioners or board members who serve either in a policy setting or advisory capacity.
The City Charter names the Mayor as President of the Police, Fire, Public Works and Water Boards.
As such, he is entitled to chair these commissions.
The Charter also dictates that he deliver his Mayor s message to the Common Council each year on January 1.
The message is, in essence, a state of the City address, outlining the accomplishments of his administration the preceding year and defining his plans for the upcoming year.
While not mandated, it is expected that he will use his office to set the ground work for development of the projects he sets forth.
The Mayor can submit proposed legislation to the Common Council for referral to the appropriate Committee for their consideration and he has the power to veto any legislation it passes when he deems it not in the best interest of the City.
This power is rarely used since most issues are explored and discussed prior to the final legislative step.
The Mayor is often invited to participate in community events and to contribute his time and efforts to their success.
While such activities tend to be voluntary, it is to his advantage and that of the City when he uses a hands on approach that keeps him informed and aware of the concerns and interests of his constituency.
City employees, taxpayers who seek his intervention and or advice and those who simply want to discuss a matter they feel would be of interest to him.
Many meetings are held during the evening, thus he is often required to be at his desk for 10 to 12 hours a day.

Barbara Smith, a registered nurse with Mount Sinai Medical Health Systems, St.
Luke s and Roosevelt Hospitals in New York, demonstrates putting on personal protective equipment  PPE  during an Ebola educational session for healthcare workers at the Jacob Javits Convention center in New York, October 21, 2014.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to reassure New Yorkers he’s on the Ebola case, and they have no reason to be concerned.
Taking to Twitter, the mayor reassured citizens that he’s got this.
Today, a patient at Bellevue Hospital tested positive for Ebola.
But let me be clear: there is no reason for New Yorkers to be alarmed.
Ebola is an extremely hard disease to contract.
It is only transmitted through bodily fluids – not simply by being near an infected person.
New York City has the world’s finest public health system.
We are highly prepared and 100% committed to keeping all New Yorkers safe.
And if those tweets weren’t reassuring enough, the mayor wants you to know President Barack Obama called to “recognize” he’s got this.
President @BarackObama called last night to recognize our city’s extensive preparations for an Ebola case.
Yes, Dominos?
Get me a large pepperoni pizza.
I d like to order a car from Williamsburg.
No, a different car.
