Some sports are de facto  not established by law  national sports, as baseball is in the United States and cricket is in England , while others are de jure  established by law  national sports, as lacrosse and ice hockey are in Canada .

Sometimes I hate being colorblind.
I think Australia is meant to be Australian Rules Football, but it s hard to tell because Australian Rules Football and Cricket are the same red in the key.
You might want to get your eyes checked.
Cricket is red, and Australian Rules Football is a dark pink color, which are quite distinct.
And apparently Nauru enjoys ARF.
Archey, the sport of watching Archer while baked on Netflix.
I m not colorblind and I can barely make out some of the color gradations in that picture.
Cricket seems to be the most popular sport in Australia, yet Australian Rules Football is in the key.
I think one of the pacific islands may have Australian Rules Football is it s colour, I was wondering this too.
I can t see horse riding on the map either.
It s Nauru .
Apparently it is the national sport.
Who knew?
What that means is that while most Australian sports fans follow cricket, football fandom is spread between AFL, NRL - Rugby League - and to a lesser extent, FFA   soccer.
Australia.
Simultaneously AFL has the largest fan base, most stadium allocation and greatest  value .
Meanwhile League has the highest tv viewership.
Maybe this map was made in relation to 1932 figures.
QLD NSW - League VIC SA WA - AFL.
That s probably true for a number of countries.
It certainly is in the US.
On that note, I estimate about a 0% chance that American football is the most participated in sport almost anywhere in the country.
Tassie - AFL NT - Not Dying from any number of things that can randomly kill you, from heat stroke to Brown Snakes to Salties.
Tennis is second and Netball third.
Although Netball is the most participated in by women.
Based on 1993 government figures.
Edit: These figures also show that Lawn Bowls is played by 115,000 people and soccer by 147,000.
Came here to say the same thing.
It doesn t help that someone took this image and passed it through a frog s butt to upload it as a shitty JPG to imgur.
No now it s different.
The one little hot pink dot to the right of Australia and up a little bit is supposed to be Australian rules football.
And horseback riding was Nasau.
I feel vindicated for pausing those 30 seconds while typing the comment to think of a suitably egregious metaphor!
Shit, I know what you mean.
The first minute I was baffled at how horse racing dominated the world.
How did everybody forget Mexico?
Not to insult you chart.
Are you talking to the chart?
It s ok, chart.
I still like you.
Only Nicaragua and Panama have baseball as their favorite, according to the chart.
The rest  Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica  have football  soccer .
Nauru - Australian Rules Football.
Don t worry, my vision is great and I can t make out this shitty chart.
I don t know how your colorlindness works but I tried to give a number to each sport.
The countries that don t have numbers  besides the countries with no information, which are 2 or 3  have soccer as their most popular sport, but I was tired of writting the number 7 in every single country.
Edit: Realised now that I forgot Mongolia  wrestling , Austria  skiing , Estonia skiing , China  table tennis  and Ireland  Gaelic football .
Come join us at  r mapporn .
This is one of the highest-rated posts there.
That s sad.
It s got the potential, it just needs people to help out.
I ll go do it for Ireland.
I love that you can see the influence of college basketball.
CT, NC, KY, KS, and AZ are all states that have very successful college basketball programs and little or no successful pro sports teams.
2?
From what I hear LoL is more popular there than SC2.
I don t think it s as big as StarCraft 1 used to be though.
Because it s not a sport?
Canada, our only ice hockey bro.
Stick together!
As in easy tap in goal if you re prepared.
Please remind Brad Marchand  Boston Bruins of the NHL  of this.
He missed 2 open-netters last night.
No I won t, Bruins can suck it!
Quote a miss, though, I saw it.
Congratulations, you are now a moderator at  r montreal !
Thank you for based Kiprusoff.
You would have a sport with grass if you didn t live in ice!
Canadian looking at Finland.
Where is archery?
That would be Bhutan.
Archery is apparently their national sport, however the Wikipedia article states that their most popular sport is actually football.
Uh, where did you get your info?
Most popular sport in Latvia is not basketball.
It s hockey.
Seriously, every single chart keeps putting basketball as our top sport for some reason.
Cool, join Finland and us in hockey paradise.
Such is life.
But 2nd most popular is nothing.
If 50% of population are diehard hockey fans - only about 10% or so are diehard basketball fans.
It makes no sense at all to put it #1 on the chart.
Source: Latvian, and hockey is everywhere.
To clarify: speaking of modern day of course.
Possibly basketball was more popular in the soviet times than it is right now.
Fist bumps Finland.
The Western Sahara don t give a fuck about polls!
No information is a sport!
I play no information and it s getting more and more popular.
You have to never read newspapers or watch news channels to win.
You re welcome world.
UK.
Hey hey HEY.
We are all over Snooker.
And then compete to a high standard in many others.
No other country can boast winning cricket, rugby and football world cups.
And for the population does rly well in olympics.
Most of the sports on here were invented in the uk, or have derived from sports invented in the uk.
To be fair, saying these sports were  invented  in one place seems a bit off.
Football games for example were played for thousands of years in many places.
Ancient Romans, Chinese, and Greeks played football games, and it s possible that medieval English football derived from a French football game called  la soule .
Modern rules did get applied in the UK though.
I think 7 of these sports originated in the UK, 4 of them being football.
But I don t want to love Australia.
You can t make me.
If only queueing was a sport.
Definately makes the colonialism worth it.
The whole ocean loves wrestling.
Never heard of Gaelic Football but it looks pretty cool.
I think much more counties play Gaelic football due to the fact that it s much much easier than hurling.
Well, in the hurling parts of the country Gaelic is still played as far as I know, whereas, at least in Ulster, the hurling teams are generally considered a joke.
Can t believe I ve never heard of it.
More like the Celtic father of all your sports.
A country s most popular sport is Archery?
And has an awesome dragon on their flag?
Go Bhutan!
Don t call the Atlanteans sea monsters!
I might be geographically challenged, but is that Mongolia that loves wrestling so much?
Also, what kind of wrestling?
Do Mongolians have their own form of wrestling?
It s Mongolia.
Oh yes, they do .
Looks neat.
Some Mongolians have done pretty well in sumo wrestling in Japan: this guy made to the top rank and was very successful.
Another Mongolian Yokozuna .
Mongolia should be pillaging.
Archery and horse racing are also very big there, but yes wrestling is definitely popular.
Yes, Mongolians have their own form of wrestling.
The vast majority of the country s population is still nomadic, but there will be wrestling events that huge numbers will migrate to at certain times of years.
Wrestling is considered the ultimately manly competition, to prove your prowess against other families.
They have fetching outfits too.
What a shit map.
Too many colors are close.
I disagree.
I think the map is very informative.
For instance, I had no idea until today that the most popular sport in America  is kickboxing.
LOL.
I came to the same conclusion.
Yeah.
Also is there any sort of source on this?
It all feels so poorly done.
Austrian here.
Can confirm.
10 more please, then we can make a team.
Because we have a good track record with that.
How in the world is this being judged?
TV ratings?
Attendance?
Money?
What?
It uses the Bible method.
The map is correct because the map says so.
The map says so because it is true.
Map is map.
Map is life.
Map is love.
You can now clearly see how Football has conquered the world.
Nepal has more football watching people than cricket, but we have a shit team for football.
Getting to the cricket world cup and performing rather good has increased the cricket viewership tremendously.
TIL: Australia loves cricket.
It s not quite a religion like in India, but between the football grand finals in September October and March, cricket is pretty much the only sport anyone cares about  bar the odd out of season Rugby test .
Source: Recent winning of the ashes followed by tour of South Africa and T20 world cup.
Up until recently we were pretty much invincible.
We even sometimes had a second side called Australia A which had the guys not quite good enough for the main team, which still won most of the time.
Only in summer.
During our winter no one could tell you what the hell our team is doing once our football league s  start.
I thought our team still toured internationally during our winter.
I m fascinated by how cricket is so isolated geographically to India Pakistan and Australia.
They all share one thing in common.
They were part of the British Empire and were members of the Commonwealth.
Cricket is incredibly popular in countries that were once a part of the Crown.
Check out the Caribbean as well, they re dominated by cricket loving countries, collectively they fall under West Indies cricket.
Commonwealth.
They still are mate!
They are part of the 53 country organisation known as the Commonwealth of Nations, and Australia is also part of 16 nations where the Queen is still the monarch known as the Commonwealth realms.
Not enough room in china for real tennis courts, I suppose.
I think all of them listed have 1 country where the sport is most popular.
Some countries are just really small and you can t find their color on the map.
Australian Rules Football.
Go.
Someone said in a comment earlier that it is the national sport of Nauru.
I can t see it on the map either but it is really small obviously.
I think it s that little spot north-northeast of Papua New Guinea.
I like this game.
It s pretty easy to guess at what the greyed out country has as it s main sport.
Am I the only one that didn t have a hard time reading this map?
I m Australian and I must say that at least in my experience AFL is the most popular sport here so I don t know what they re on about : .
2 different forms of rugby.
Found horse racing.
S.
As an American  and of Indian descent , I ve felt out of touch with the sports culture here.
I feel as though they prioritize American football, basketball, and baseball above all.
Personally, I have an unhealthy obsession with soccer, tennis, and cricket.
None of those have a huge market here, though soccer is growing considerably  2nd most popular sport for 12-24 age group .
It d be nice if our media  ESPN, mainly  made us more well versed in other sports so that instead of only talking about the NBA and Stanley cup playoffs now they would also talk about the champions league semis which are on the second leg this week and have 10 times greater magnitude.
Why isn t North Korea labelled basketball?
Did they do the survey in the labour camps or something?
More than 50% of the population is from South Asia, where cricket is like a religion.
Less than 20% of UAE residents are Emiratis.
They host the IPL there, that probably helps its cause.
The stadiums have been full in Dubai and Sharjah.
Hard to believe that there are no countries where motorsport isn t the most popular, especially Finland.
They love their motorsport there.
I m surprised rugby isn t more popular.
Skiing is no longer the most popular in Estonia.
I ve tried to research this sport called  No information , but couldn t find any info on it.
From the name, it sounds like it s a sport that requires great use of the mind.
Perhaps you need to find intel about your opponents in order to win.
I ll have to show that to my son.
He loves sports and is always interested in sports around the world.
Thanks!
Afghanistans most popular sport is not cricket.
Its football  soccer  .
Or buzkashi .
Where s  Horse Racing  on the map?
I ve tried very hard and I cannot find the country that chose Horse Racing.
Americans.
And by  rocks  you mean  is mildly interesting .
Soccer is everywhere!
Why?
Soccer has been the most popular sport in Russia for a long time.
It dominates TV viewing.
At international level rugby is more popular,  but at club level and general amateur participation football wins easily.
Step 1.
The dumbest fucking part is that America wasn t even mentioned save for the actual map.
Heavy lies the crown.
Well at the time baseball was only played in the US and the World Series was between the two best teams in the US so it did decide the best team in the world.
Even now that there are other leagues around the world all the best players end up in the majors so it still determines the best team in the world.
This just in: apparently Toronto in in the USA.
Source:  u ilovesheets .
Edit: This is a little snarkier than I had intended it to be  a little .
There are players from 20 different nations in the MLB.
The World Series is baseball.
Which on this map is the most popular sport in Japan, but not America.
I m very confused by your comment.
This is easily the dumbest of all reddit circlejerks.
Probably led by American teenagers who just don t like baseball.
The World Series as we know it is roughly 110 years old.
I don t know how its name came about, and I don t care.
It doesn t mean anything.
The origin of the name  World Series  was from a newspaper that was the original sponsor - the New York World, rather than the intention being that it was a global event.
Edit: according to Snopes this is a myth.
That is not even what the map shows.
Ireland has held the World Gaelic Football champions title for centuries!
Although London has won one All-Ireland hurling title!
Step 2.
Restrict your championship to only those in your pro league even though other countries are starting to play your sports and getting good at it.
For a sec I thought Finland s most popular sport was american football, I was surprised.
Then a took a second look and it turned out to be hockey, not so surprised.
Although it really does seem like the only realistic answer I refuse to believe China s favorite sport is table tennis.
It s nothing against the Chinese, they are amazing at the sport in all fairness.
Yeah it almost seems like a joke by the mapmaker  although I would ve gone with MMO gold farming if I was joking .
Is there anyone Chinese or otherwise who can explain the state of table tennis in China?
I mean, if it s like other countries, then I m picturing stadiums filled with tens of thousands of rabid fans surrounding a ping pong table, the best players being absolute rock stars signing endorsement deals, 24 hour sports networks breaking down the details of every match.
I can imagine all this for soccer in China but not table tennis.
Which is why I think the map is wrong.

Country Weekend is one of the three Escada Sport collection fragrances.
It was presented in 1996 as a woody spicy fragrance for women, designed by Ilias Ermenidis .
Fresh apple and intensive marigold form the top notes.
Heart is sweet of bay leaf, jasmine, cinnamon and red wood.
Cedar wood, cashmere and nutmeg are at the base.
The creator of “Escada Sport” bottles is Thierry Lecoule DESIGN.
This particular bottle was made to be green.
I was not impressed by the scent of this fragrance when I tried it for the first time.
Y.
I am a huge fan of ESCADA summer fragrances and this one is nothing like any of those.
This frag is light and refreshing.
Very woody and greenery.
It s the type of frags that I can wear every day for any occasions but it won t be my first choice.
I found it at the bottom of the shelf in a drugstore and at a low price.
It s been untouched for many years.
Dust all over it.
It looked sad being there.
I was hoping for an apple pie type of scent but what I picked up from Country Weekend was a strongly spicy which was low on sweetness and unnoticeable on the note of apple.
This is my number one perfume and Im from the UK, I can never find this, I fear it has been discontinued and goodness knows why as I think its the best perfume in the world.
Although fresh and green, I find this perfume to be really comforting and warm.
Its spicy and woody fresh but at the same time light.
I can see that this is quite masculine in some ways but I put it on liberally.
Im sick of trying to find this perfume and just wish it was more available.
I have never been able to find it in shops in the UK, occasionally online, more often in european perfumeries, but now I cant find it anywhere.
Very nutmeggy   i actually smell cardomon more  , woody and bay leafy.
I like to mix this with the orange escada sport.
I first tried this perfume as a blind test at a local drug store  along with about 15 other scents the same day .
I arrived home, I found myself continuously smelling my right hand where I d sprayed this mysterious fragrance.
The drydown is pleasantly opposite from it s harsh opening.
This perfume is very unusual in that it manages to be warm, spicy, and green all at the same time.
A very mature perfume.
Excellent sillage and longevity with a light spicy herbal- yet sweet- drydown.
This may be a hard perfume for some to wear given the challenging marigold topnote.
The price is a veritable bargain at less than $40 bottle, and it s far better crafted than any of the new Escada tutti-fruttis.
I love it!
At first i thought it s too masculine  but with the time it changed to very green, citrus and fruity scent.
A very strange fragrance.
I tried it and I am still puzzled.
Then it develops into something more subtle and flowery, you start feeling cinnamon and even jasmine, but the pine needles are still so there.
The best part I like so far is the base, it is absolutely amazing - the nutmeg and wood create a very feminine touch and in a while it almost smells like Kenzo Amour at it`s best  only on the skin though, not on the clothes .
Don`t know if I love it?

2 billion people  watched at least a minute of the World Cup in 2010, and preliminary numbers from this year all say the 2014 Cup s numbers are  going to be way higher .
That means about half, if not more, of the world s population will have watched this year s cup.
But, after taking a look at this map of the most popular sports around the world, that shouldn t surprise us all that much.
Soccer dominates the global sports scene, in a way that s almost impossible to appreciate in the abstract.
Sure, there s a few other interesting tidbits in here.
The English speaking world loves the ball-carrying sports like American football, rugby, and Gaelic football.
Cold places like hockey.
And the Indian subcontinent is really into cricket.
But soccer supremacy is the big story.
In virtually all of Europe, South America, Africa, and the Middle East, soccer is king.
Ditto most of Asia and Central America.
If it weren t for people s weird tastes in China and some former British colonies, soccer would basically be a universal sport.
As of right now, it s pretty damn close.

You might not be surprised that Nepal and Togo s lone Olympic representatives were cross-country skiers, who finished 86th  in mens 15km classic  and 68th  in ladies 10km classic  respectively.
Peru gave no love to its sole representative, also a cross-country skier.
India was the most excited about hockey, which sort of makes you wonder if the Facebook data collection process differentiated between  ice hockey  and  field hockey,  which is very popular there.
Every event is represented somewhere on the map, except for Freestyle Skiing and Skeleton, which were just getting started on the 13th.
Hopefully Facebook will released an updated map towards the end of the games, so we can see just how insane the world gets once ladies single skating begins.

Let s completely disregard the Sixers.
The college high school game in Philadelphia is top notch.
There were 3 college basketball teams that made the NCAA Tournament this year from the city, and pretty much any 4 of those City 6 teams can make it during any year.
Not to mention all of the talent that has come out of there.
Kobe, Tyreke, Bynum, the Morris twins Tyrone Garland, Wilt, countless others have come from the metropolitan area of Philadelphia.
EDIT: I know the Bears are an institution in Chicago, but I would think that Basketball is their favorite sport easily with how much talent they churn out of there as well.
Soccer s only going to get more popular in the US.

Great prices and friendly service!

I was in Country Ski a few weeks back getting ready for my snowboarding trip to Whistler for New Years.
I needed some soft goods and since I don t have much time to stay up to speed with what s going on in gear world, I was  looking to enlist the help of their staff.
Usually I don t do this, especially in specialty shops, because I don t like the pressure to buy or bad vibes for not knowing ridiculous details of what I thought was just a sweater.
I was checking out their jackets.
Being a reduce, reuse, recycle kinda guy, i was happy to learn the Planet Earth jackets they stock use sustainable fabrics.
They had a great selection which made finding something that fit my style easy.
Ray was asking me questions while I was grabbing some other stuff and he suggested I check out their custom footbeds.
I ve been using Superfeet and love them, but felt a step up in the footbed department would be instrumental in  getting my riding to the next level.
I was hoping the custom footbeds  would have an impact similar to using the right running shoes for my foot strike.
They worked out way better than I expected!
I had no problems with the new boots I got for Christmas  K2 Maysis  on my first day out.
Footbed and boot overall felt great.
That was a huge for my week long trip in Whistler!
The gears kept me dry, warm, and comfortable which is precisely what I need.
Custom footbeds are killer.
It s a huge step up!
Got a great deal on everything.
Knowledgeable staff helped me find some things I might have missed  they even had a helmet delivered the next morning from one of their other stores , and they gave me some great advice on caring for my equipment, too.
5 stars  for customer service, price, and selection.

I stopped in looking for advice on a new pair of skis.
The sales there at the time  a younger guy named Ray  was incredibly helpful.
He did a great helping me with sizing and wasn t pushy in anyway.
He didn t try to up sell me on anything, which is probably what I liked best about the whole experience.
When I asked about a more expensive ski he was open and honest, saying that for the price the Volkl RTM75 was incredible and more than I needed.
I ve skied on them 5x so far this winter and couldn t be happier.
The shop also ton of clothing and soft goods, and the prices were reasonable.
All round it s a great ski shop, my new go to for the metro west area.

Watch out FF!
This place is amazing.
I am so happy to have a specialty store like this is in our area.
I went in for a new pair of running shoes and Leon was awesome.
He asked me a few questions about my needs and what my activities are and then inspected my current shoes for wear patterns to give him a clue about what features would be best for me in my new pair.
He did a video analysis of my gait on the treadmill and then spent plenty of time going over my options.
He answered all of my questions and was knowledgable and professional the entire time.
I didn t feel like I needed to be a marathon runner to be important in the store.
I m just a runner and that was enough to get the same kindness and attention as everyone else.
There is also an area set aside for kids that you can see from almost anywhere in the store.
As a mom of two small boys, I was impressed.
They also stock plenty of great running gear and supplements.

Went in today for the first time.
This store is big, items are well displayed and they have a great selection - shoes and gear.
I came in looking for a new running shoe.
I was fitted in 2012 and have since improved as a runner and wondered if I need a different shoe - I also was looking for a shoe with a lower heel to toe drop.
I don t know who was working today  a blonde hair lady and a man with dark hair  I explained to them my running history and what I am now looking for.
After that they had me run on a treadmill while they filmed it.
I was super excited about that because I ve always wanted to see how I run.
Based on my running and what I told them I wanted they gave me a few options.
I didn t buy anything today - the shoes I really wanted to get I needed to read up on and do some research.
I decided tonight that I will be calling them tomorrow to order the shoes.
The staff was very helpful, friendly and I loved that this shop has the option to film you while running.
Very cool!
It is out of my way - I live in midtown Sacramento, but I would recommend them and I will be back.
They have a great inventory.
More than Fleet Feet downtown.
The most recent shoes I bought were Newtown but Fleet Feet no longer carries them  they have stopped carrying some less popular brands, even though they are good shoes .
Very happy with everything today.
Thanks Gold Country!

Looking forward to the fun runs in the near future.

Excellent service!
Paulo did a gait running analysis and showed me on iPad how my left foot over pronates.
I tried three different pairs of shoes and quickly educated me and provided me with 3 different options.
We then narrowed it down to the most comfortable pair of running shoes.
Paulo was ultra helpful, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to deal with.

I love the shoes I got at Gold Country Run and Sport and I don t even run.
Susan helped me find just the right pair that are amazingly comfortable and good looking too.
I have had a lot of compliments on them from my gym buddies and my feet love them.
Expect great customer service and knowledge about running equipment at this store!
I ll definitely be back for more.

Fantastic, knowledgeable, patient staff!
Leon was great in spending a crazy amount of time helping me find the right shoe.
There was absolutely no pressure to buy, and I love that he analyzed my gait in my old shoes, and in a few of the new ones I was considering.
I have been a Fleet Feet devotee for years, but Gold Country Run and Sport has earned my repeat business.
Sacramento folks, making the drive to El Dorado Hills for this exceptional customer service and knowledge is well worth it!

I decided to check out Gold Country Run and Sport since I was planning on starting to run again.
I stopped about six months ago after developing plantar fasciitis and knee pain.
I previously purchased my shoes at Fleet Feet.
However, the last few times the clerk was a college student that was not real knowledgeable.
So it was refreshing to see Gold Country well staffed, with extremely knowledgeable staff.
I ran on the tread mill and the sales person recorded it with an iPad, then we watched it in slow motion and he could tell what was wrong with my gait.
He then showed me a number of different shoes, based on the terrain I run on  dirt paths along Folsom Lake .
The selection of high end shoes is amazing.
You simply do not see many of these shoes at Sports Authority.
The prices are retail, but some shoes were on sale.
I went with a pair of Asics trail shoes and I love them.
No knee pain or plantar fasciitis  yet , but the store also carries specific items for these ailments.
As a runner, I m ecstatic that this place exists.

We offer running shoes and clothing, yoga apparel, socks, hydration gear, GPS watches and heart rate monitors, earphones, illumination and safety gear, headbands, visors and hats, sleeves, tights and insoles, and more.
Established in 2013.
Our story starts with a simple plot - create something special in an amazing setting that addresses a specific need in our community; a beautiful Storefront staffed with great people who can serve the running and fitness enthusiasts in El Dorado Hills, Folsom and the surrounding foothill communities.
We are blessed to live in an area that offers some of the most beautiful scenery and running trails that embrace the lifestyle of combining running, fitness and the beauty of Gold Country!
In late 2012 two long time business colleagues and friends with a mutual love of running decided to give our community what it deserves: a world class-operated specialty running store that is truly local yet offers the same level of products and customer service found in the top national specialty stores.
After a year of careful research and planning we are thrilled to open our store up to you and your family and hope that runners and other fitness enthusiasts of  all levels will come and visit us!
What s This?

Fall conditions are here on Lake Superior.
The Lake Trout and Salmon are coming into shallower waters preparing for fall spawning runs.
Coho s, Browns and some Splake are showing up in the Falls River, Silver River, Huron River, Sand Point and the head of the bay of Keweenaw Bay by the third bridge.
Those who are trolling in the bay are finding fish suspended 20 to 40 feet down and are fishing with stick baits, spoons, dodgers and squids.
The fall salmon and steelhead runs will continue on the rivers and should progress until mid November depending on the water levels and temperatures.
Coho s in the rivers are being caught mainly on orange, chartreuse, and pink Mepps spinners.
The fall color change is in full swing and the colors will peak in the next week or two.
Grouse, waterfall, and fall turkey seasons are under way.
Archery season starts October 1st and this is a good time to be scouting for deer season.
Keweenaw Bay will produce Lake Trout,Whitefish, Salmon, Herring, and Smelt.
Huron Bay will do the same along with a few Walleye, Perch, Lawyers and nice Northern.
Local fishing methods include bobbing with a traditional Käppu  geboo  set up with wire line, a heavy jigging lure, and bait and of course our Unique TeePee tents.
This method catches the big ones on Lake Superior.
Keweenaw Bay on Lake Superior is known as the Lake Trout Capital.
What s the Most Dominant Country In Each Winter Olympic Sport?
The Netherlands   utter destruction  of speed skating in Sochi this year is something not seen before in a single Olympics.
As Olympstats detailed Tuesday morning , while other nations have had memorable Olympiads, with some even sweeping an entire category, no country since the 1970s has reeled in medals at such a high rate, and no country has ever come close to doing so over so many events.
For example, Finland s cross-country team won two-thirds of the medals in 1952, but in less than half the number of races.
The Dutch performance has truly been impressive.
But are they the most dominant nation out there?
Other countries have been able to control certain Olympic sports in particular years, but we wanted to examine the longer view and see which countries tend to dominate a sport over multiple Winter Games — even over multiple decades.
To see which nations have the tightest grip on their favorite events, we looked at all the medals handed out in each of 11 Winter Olympic sports from 1980 to 2014, and compared that to the number of medals won by one country s athletes within those sports.
The resulting winning percentage shows how many medals that country has won out of the total number available.
For example, while speed skating has long been the Netherlands  strongest sport, they haven t always been as dominant as they ve been in 2014.
They ve won 22 percent of all speed skating medals handed out since 1980.
That s good, but not the most dominant ever.
That honor goes to Germany s* lugers, who take the top spot with a stellar 37 percent of all luge medals, followed closely by Russia s figure skating and ice dancing teams at 34 percent.
Note:  Germany includes East and West Germany as well as unified Germany, so they had more teams available.
Surprisingly, at the other end, despite  Norway and Austria  having a reputation for dominance in the skiing competitions, they have faced much tougher competition in their strongest events.
Also of note: Canada has won 33 percent of all curling medals since the sport was introduced in 1998.
But it s not enough to just place.
True dominance happens at the top, so we also graphed the gold medal win percentage.
Since 1980, Germany has won an astounding 55 percent of all luge golds  22 total , which includes this year s sweep of golds in all four luge events.
Still, it was just a tad above Russia s 21 golds in 39 figure skating competitions, good for 54 percent of all the sports  golds.
South Korea s dominance of short track is similarly impressive; of its 45 total Winter Olympic medals, 37 have been in short track speed skating, including 19 golds.
So what did we learn?
The Netherlands have been out of this world in 2014, but it s too early to place them among the best Winter Games dynasties.
The Dutch have a long way to go before they catch the German lugers and Russian figure skaters.

Many years ago I had expressed the thought that the gloomier the front pages became, the more inspiring the back pages would seem.
There is now competition for gloom, occasionally anger seems the more appropriate sentiment amongst those that watch the news a lot!
Maybe as an outcome of that, and doubtlessly it is one of many reasons, there is greater interest in sport now than ever before.
A far more important reason though is the growth in television and more sophisticated packaging and indeed, a more wired generation that sees the best in sport from around the world.
It is a benefit, and a challenge, to Indian sport as I suspect the new football league  the Indian Super League, ISL  is going to discover.
More people than ever before are watching sport but more critically, they are supporting teams as well.
As team loyalties grow, and as sport is placed in a context, the need to watch the very best, while still important, no longer becomes the only reason to watch sport.
The ISL will hope that is true.
Every day the football fan in India has the opportunity to see the very best in action.
He, and increasingly she, can see Barcelona and Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus and of course the English Premiership.
Almost every top player is on view, television brings quality presentation and commentary, social media creates fan groups, forums for discussion, there is a whole world in itself out there.
In such a situation, can football go local?
Will fans, used to the very best, be willing to watch a completely different standard of football?
While you cannot force anybody, especially where so many options are available, I believe they will.
And they must.
And the key to attract the fan lies in the creation of localised competition and support.
In many countries in the world, the fans throng stadiums to express support for a club even when aware that they are nowhere near the best in the world.
They come to watch for a different reason.
South Africa is a good example where they struggle to make an impression even in the African Cup of Nations but have a very decently supported local league.
The Kaiser Chiefs are big without being a Real Madrid.
That is what I hope the Indian Super League will achieve.
There is a wider reason I want the ISL to do very well, which is the same reason I wanted the Hockey League to do well and was delighted with the response to the first edition of the Kabaddi League.

I had a very nice couple onboard with me on August the 19th at Don Pedro.
The morning was cloudy with a slight breeze that made it fairly cool and required a windbreaker for the first couple hours.
I set out four rods at all different depths and while I was explaining on what to do when the fish hit, a fish did hit one of the rods and soon we had our first fish of the day in the ice chest.
The morning was moving along very nicely as we were getting a fish about every 15 to 20 minutes.
Then things started slowing down so we kept moving and searching for our next fish.
When things were slow for a little longer than normal we had a double hook up to make things exciting and it turned to be  two nice size bass.
After experiencing a slow period I decided to move our fishing on to hopefully better conditions.
It wasn’t long and our bite picked up again and this time we found where the trout had moved to.
After a few lost fish and a few more boated we ended the day with eight rainbows and three bass from the waters of Don Pedro with two great people.
I had four great people onboard with me today 8-18-2014 at Don Pedro.
The trip was scheduled to last until about 11:00 O’clock.
I set out four rods at different depths and all different colors.
Finally after about 45 minutes we were finally able to land our first fish and soon another.
I was able to see a pattern working for us so I continued to work the surrounding area and we were on out way to a good day on the water.
We had seven fish in the cooler at 10:40 and we would fish until we landed one more fish and sure thing about 20 more minutes later we put the last fish of the day in the cooler and we headed in.
A great day on the waters of Don Pedro with great people.
Thanks again everyone and thank you for fishing Gold Country Sportfishing.
I had return client Robert and Ryan this time it was at Don Pedro.
They wanted to catch rainbows at Don Pedro.
I picked them up off there house boat and we headed out to the fishing grounds.
I set out four of my home made spoons at a fast pace so we could hopefully find the fish faster.
The first two hours we had nothing and we continued searching and finally we found some fish.
The bite was tough as the fish were scattered but they still managed to land six rainbows to two and a half pounds from the waters of Don Pedro by noon.
Thanks again you two.
I had return client John Kern and he brought his along his 10-year-old grandson for a day’s fishing at Hogan reservoir to catch stripers.
The previous day I had two clients and we only had two strikes all day and I was very skeptical on taking John and his grandson out to try once again.
I called John and told him what the deal was and if he still wanted to go, well they said sure let’s try it.
The day started out with us hooking fish before I could not  even get all the rods out fishing and before eight o’clock we had four nice stripers in the boat, then the bite seemed to shut down and we just kept working the lake for several hours with a strike here and there  and finally the bite picked back up and by the days end they had boated eight stripers from the waters of Hogan reservoir, oh and they landed one fat cat-fish that went back.
A great day with great people and memories for a ten-year old boy.

The most difficult sport of all.
There are no timeouts, substitutions, halftimes, or other breaks.
Because of this, the sport requires extreme amounts of stamina and talent to play, and to be successful, it requires even more effort.
1 miles  over varied terrains, including hills, roads, mud puddles, grassy fields, rocky paths, and sometimes even shallow streams.
To complete the race, the runners must not only have the strength to finish, but must also be aware of their surroundings at all times.
Stop paying attention to your surroundings, and you could fall, costing you valuable seconds, knocking you out of the race, or even sending you to the hospital.
Cross country is not to be confused with indoor outdoor track.
Although they have long-distance events, their longest usually is 5k, cross country s shortest.
Also, they have no hills or other obstacles; they just run around a track many times.
Road races aren t technically true cross country races, but usually get grouped together with cross country races because of their distance and hills.
A true cross country race stays away from pavement as much as possible.
To succeed in cross country, a couple things are neccessary.
For one, you have to have a strong heart and put in lots of practice.
If running 5+ miles a day doesn t sound like a good workout, you d better try a less-taxing sport.
Secondly, a good pair a racing and training shoes are a must.
For racing, lightweight flats or spikes work well; the course determines which is the better choice.
For best results, a pair of shoes with removable spikes works well.
Training shoes should be sturdy and  durable; training shoes should not be your everyday sneakers.
Buy another pair specifically for running.
Just remember - don t wear training shoes during a race; although flats only cut off a few seconds each mile, over a, say 10 mile race, this can make a big difference.
And before a race starts, always make sure your shoes are double-knotted.
You don t want to run with untied shoes or have to tie them during a race.
Also, always make sure your uniform shirt is tucked in.
This also shaves seconds off your time.
Unless the temperature is below freezing, wear shorts when racing, again to get better times.
If it is too cold, wear pants to prevent your legs from becoming too cold, thus preventing them from working at their best.
Cross country is cool in that it can be both an individual and team sport.
Individuals compete against other runners and their own PRs  personal records  over the distance.
The individual runners  scores are added up for a team score; the lower the score, the better.
A lot of people criticize distance runners, especially sprinters.
They make fun of us for wearing short shorts, they say our sport is primitive and requires no talent, ect.
While it is true we don t have the same turnouts as football, baseball, or basketball games have, our small fan base is friendly.
We don t have hecklers and brawls because our team lost.
Our fans are civilized and respect the winning team and all athletes, regardless of their talent.
I know this one runner whose extremely slow  10+ minute miles , and instead of taunting him, the fans wait for him to finish and treat him with respect.
They cheer him on the same as they did for the fastest guy.
Rather than just winning and money, isn t this what sports should really be about?
A sport which is superior to every other sport, because you need talent, and endurance to stand up to the challenge.
AND you hafta be a crazy ass mofo to do it, like me.
Cross country is better than field hockey because field hockey is for talentless ho s.
Wow!
Those cross country guys ran 10 miles!
Some people limit their challenges.
Champions challenge their limits - cross country runners always challenge their limits.

All eyes are fixed firmly on Scotland today as voters head to the polls to have their say on the independence referendum.
In the months, weeks and days leading up to this historic vote, all mannner of famous faces have had their say on whether or not Scotland should leave the union - including actors, musicians and sportspeople.
1 tennis player Andy Murray revealed that his own opinions on the matter had been swayed in the final few days of campaigning by both sides - and that he intends to vote for an independent Scotland.
But what have Scotland s other sporting greats got to say on the matter?
Murray has previously landed himself in hot water on the topic of the Union, following comments about England s 2006 World Cup campaign he says were made in jest.
Huge day for Scotland today!
The former Manchester United manager has been a figurehead of the Better Together campaign and firmly believes that a united Britain is better for Scots.
800,000 Scots, like me, live and work in other parts of the UK.
Despite making his views well-known, the legendary Scot is one of several people on this list not actually allowed to vote, as he does not currently live in Scotland.
I played for Scotland and managed the Scotland team.
Katherine Grainger may not have said which way she is leaning, but the Olympic gold medal-winning rower has expressed a view that sport and politics shouldn t mix.
In the build-up to the referendum, she asked people to stop asking Scottish athletes about the issue of independence.
As an athlete, what I find hard is that any Scottish athlete kind of gets pulled into the debate and it s very rare you hear an athlete deliberately speaking out about it.
Britain s most successful-ever Olympian , the 11-time World Champion and six-time Olympic champion has represented both Team GB and Scotland.
Nevertheless, he has copped a lot of grief from Scottish nationalists for questioning the impact that independence will have on Scottish sport.
The most decorated Olympic cyclist in the history of his sport, Sir Chris has previously told the BBC that he wouldn t have enjoyed all the success he has without enjoying access to world-class training and coaching facilities south of the border.
This is something something he feels that Scotland currently lacks, warning that Scottish athletes may find it harder to compete at the top level if Scotland does become fully independent.
The Formula One legend was fully in support of a referendum, believing that Scots should have the opportunity to vote on their future.
But the 75-year-old has not publicly stated his own beliefs on the matter, telling MSN last year that he doesn t have an opinion because he is  apolitical .
I made the decision as a young sportsman that I didn t ever want to contribute financially or lend my personal support to politicians because I didn t think it was an appropriate thing to do.
I don t vote in Scotland because of that.
I personally question whether there will be independence.
Connie Ramsay took home a bronze medal from the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and she s one of the famous faces fronting the Sport for Yes campaign,  so it s safe to say we know which way she ll be voting today.
We see other smaller countries like Denmark, Sweden, Norway and they all manage much better than the UK does, so why can t we give it a go?
If everyone gets behind Scotland we can make it work, and make a better go of it.
What excites me about being an independent country is actually having a country of our own, and to be proud of.
We d get to do what we want to do and what is best for everyone who lives in Scotland, rather than being governed by Westminster governments we don t vote for.
We can concentrate on making Scotland the best it can be.
To me, that s exciting.
Eve Muirhead doesn t agree though.
The captain of the Team GB women s curling team wants to continue representing Britain.
You re one big team and we re all together.
He also has similar views to the 72-year-old on the subject of the referendum for Scottish independence.
Former Aberdeen, Spurs and Barcelona ace Steve Archibald is another high-profile supporter of the Sport for Yes campaign.
The Scotland Hall of Fame inductee believes that Westminster is  only interested in protecting it s own wealth .
The people of Scotland must take charge of decisions regarding their own future.
Rangers manager Ally McCoist is one of several Scottish footballers to sign up to the Better Together team, and was even named in a team line-up of it s members, put together by the movement.
We are proud Scots who have been proud to represent our country around the world.
When Scotland calls, we answer.
We are proud that Scotland has always stood on its own two feet but we also believe that Scotland stands taller because we are part of the United Kingdom.
Along with Moyes and McCoist, Rangers legend and current player manager at Scottish second division club Clyde, Barry Ferguson is another firm believer in the UK.
In supporting the Better Together movement, he is also joined by the likes of Lisbon lion Bertie Auld, former Rangers manager Walter Smith, and ex-Celtic boss Billy McNeill.

Opn from- Santa Debnath,Tripura,Bishalgarh.
I am from the United States of America and my favorite sport is basketball.
My second favorite sport is football.
Lacrosse has been tagged as “the fastest game on two feet” and those “feet” are rapidly moving across the country.
Colleges and High Schools are now adding Lacrosse to their athletic repertoire as the sport gains attention in areas that knew little if anything about the game in the past.
Lacrosse originated from Native North Americans who often played the game as a way to train for warfare.
The game may not be played for the same reasons today, but the action and intensity that is displayed is still highly competitve and exciting.
Traditionally, Lacrosse has been most popular in the Northeast, especially in hotbeds like Baltimore, New England, and New York.
This is no longer the case with hotbeds now forming in the states of California, Colorado, Texas, Florida, and several other.
In 2000 there were 1,273 programs across the country.
Below is a map that illustrates the placement of these programs in 2000.
The city of each program was geocoded to find it’s lat lon and then placed on the map.
The red dots represent the lat lon placement of a program’s city.
In 2007 there were a recorded number of 2612 Boy’s High School Lacrosse Programs across the country.
That is more than double the amount that existed in 2000 and equates to about 190 new programs a year in that time frame!
All this in only 7 years!
Below is a map showing the locations of the 2007 programs across the country.
Pay close attention to comparing maps in the states of California, Florida, Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Minnesota, and Illinois.
The Northeast still shows itself to be the hotbed of Boy’s High School Lacrosse but there is an apparent difference between the two heatmaps.
The 2000 map is extremely bright in New England and we see in the 2007 map that the brightness of New England has faded a bit over time.
It is highly probable that in another 7 years the heat will spread throughout the country as new programs spring up in areas other than the Northeast.
Below illustrates a state that has had tremendous growth from 2000 to 2007.
New England.
In 2000 there were a mere 40 High School Boy’s Lacrosse Programs throughout the entire state.
In 2007, there were 173.
This is a dramatic increase and illustrates how non-traditional hotbeds are discovering the sport and expanding it’s presence rapidly.
The maps below show the spread from San Francisco to San Diego between 2000 and 2007.
Colleges and Universities are creating programs across the country which are attracting growing number of players to their schools.
Below are two maps that show the growth of NCAA Division 3 Men’s Lacrosse Programs across the country.
The first map illustrates the number of programs in 1999.
The second map shows the number in 2007.
In 1999 there were 112 programs and in 2007 there were 138.
With the amount of high school players playing now the demand for more programs at the collegiate level has increased.
It is expected that more colleges and universities will be creating lacrosse programs at their schools in the near future.
Another major factor in the spread and growth of lacrosse is Major League Lacrosse  MLL .
Started in 2001 the league contains 10 teams all throughout the country.
This has helped pushed the popularity of the sport by showcasing it’s top players.
The teams have gained a following in their respected areas which include a few teams that are not located in the traditional hotbed of the Northeast.
The map below illustrates where all ten of these locations can be found.
Notice the correlation between MLL team locations and the growing hotbeds of High School Lacrosse.
Western teams like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, and Chicago are all in areas where high school programs are showing a tremendous amount of growth.
What has caused the game to spread so quickly?
There are a 4 main factors.
1.
Increased visibility in the National Media.
2.
Development of a Professional League 3.
Growth of new High School and College Programs 4.
Growth of Youth Programs.
Knowledge of the game is spreading making it no longer appear to be in the dark to the general public.
The game is also very appealing.
It is fast-paced and full of non-stop action.
It is a good mix between many popular American sports such as football, basketball, and hockey.
The whole of America is starting to discover Lacrosse and it is spreading just as fast as the game itself.

Lacrosse is also something fresh for the kids now.
There are tons of kids screaming out for a fun sport they can pick up and run with and lets face it, time has weathered football into perfection and boredom.
Many kids cant deal with the pressure or need to be perfect atmosphere highschool football seems to give them.
Lacrosse makes them feel like pioneers while being comfortable, the lacrosse community is outstanding right now.
Lacrosse, sometimes referred to as the fastest game on two feet, would be an excellent addition to the Olympics.
To go from and “F” grade to a “D” is hardly exciting.
The game is very slow to develope and the top tier athletes are still playing football, baseball and basketball.
At recreation levels kids all complain about little ball distribution and on-field team participation.
Will see the same decline in numbers as any other mature sport.
Still better option then soccer!

The 16-year-old, who manages and coaches Merley Cobham Sports under-nines and plays for the club’s under-18s, passed with flying colours.
A sixth-former at Corfe Hills School , where he is studying biology, psychology, PE and Spanish, Sean is targeting a top job in coaching.
He told the Daily Echo: “I want to coach professionally and my dream is to coach Barcelona.
Sean got the bug when he was 12 after ex- Cherries youth coach Jason Blake, who now heads the Academy at Premier League Burnley, took some sessions at Merley Cobham.
That was my first taste of watching a professional coach and it stayed with me,” said Sean, who has been invited by Blake to spend a few days helping out with coaching at Burnley.
I enjoy seeing improvements in the players and the team and working with other coaches and mucking in on a Saturday morning.
I play football for fun but want to make a career out of coaching.
I know most professional coaches have been players but there are some notable exceptions.
Jason is one of my role models and Jose Mourinho is another.
I have always looked up to him and he didn’t play at the highest level.
He studied the game, took all the qualifications and came through that way.
Sean, who is also a fully-qualified referee, spent five months working towards his FA level two coaching certificate and added it to his level one and a youth module one qualifications.
He will spend the next four years working towards his UEFA B licence, which can only be taken once a coach has turned 21, before hoping to break through into the professional ranks.

Coach Mark here on his soap box for just a little bit.
We all need to be more respectful of the place we call High Country Sports Arena.
This is a great place that was built by volunteers and is run by volunteers.
My kids like to refer to the place as our second home.
The problem is that we continue to have our kids treat our home with disrespect.
Well yes it is all of our kids.
We leave trash all over the place in the rooms.
We use the rental equipment and just leave it in the locker room for someone else to pick-up.
We look for rental equipment and pull all the rental gear out on the floor and then leave it there.
We try to find a jersey and pull all the jerseys out and leave them all over the floor.
We bring our drinks to the benches and just leave the half full bottle on the bench for some else to put it in the recyling bin that is 2 feet away.
We bring our food to eat and leave the cup and bag in the stands for some else to throw them away.
Look around the rink and you will see where our kids have broken the cabinets in the rental shop.
Have broken the doors  so we put in solid core doors , have continued to show disrespect to our home.
Here is my challenge to everyone that takes the time to read this.
Lets do our best to make sure that our kids behave when they are in our home.
If they are not behaving then we need to straighten them out and make them behave.
Every kid in this arena is one of our kids and we have a responsibility to make sure that they behave and respect our home.
So if you see them out of line.
Lets call them on it and lets make our home a better place.
Are there any other sports you would like to see offered at High Country Sports Arena?

Asked by anonymous.
In certain sports today we have seen a growing trend of domination by certain races.
Although there are exceptions in every case, it is evident that African Americans for example, dominate basketball.
There may be some biological characteristics that give certain races advantages in athletics, but we want to argue that it is a product of social structure.
It is a known fact that rewards and opportunities are much more accessible to those of upper and upper middle classes.
Kozol, pg.
93  Clubs and other groups are organized for these privileged people and their children.
For example we have institutions called country clubs.
This is a piece of land where, for the right price one can go to swim, golf play tennis, or just shoot the breeze at the bar with fellow members.
People who are not as fortunate as this privileged class are denied because they can not meet the financial requirements.
From this social structuring, we see a huge difference between the patterns of life between the two groups.
Inner city kids  mostly black and Latino  will never have the opportunity to go to a country club and take golf lessons like suburban  mostly white and Asian  kids will.
We think this social stratification gap is a major reason why inner city youth are not able to develop skills in sports that require expensive equipment and facilities.
We see the well off kids excel at golf, tennis, swimming, water polo, and volleyball, while the inner city kids excel in most notably basketball and soccer.
All you need for these sports are a ball, playing field, and a goal.
It is true that inner city kids sometimes have some exposure to these  country club  sports, however there is not enough of an interest by the kids or adults to make progress in those sport programs.
More often than not, urban areas lack the facilities and the money to provide these sports programs for the kids.
These kids are left with few choices to fill up their free time.
Kids either play a sport like basketball, work, or get into trouble.
We think that if there were more of an interest and opportunity for these  country club  sport programs for inner city kids, they would have a greater opportunity to excel and use this as a ticket to continue their education.
Even if they are not able to use a sport to get out of their neighborhood, at least they would be spending their free time in a healthy way and not getting into trouble with gangs, drugs, or criminal activities.
We have seen a few examples of how minority kids with the right effort and constant persistence of a dream and encouragement by parents can succeed in  country club  sports.
Tiger Woods is one of the most recent minority examples.
Tiger was one of the first men to break the color line in professional golf.
He did this with great poise and an impressive sense of professionalism for such a young man.
Looking at Tiger on the streets, one would stereotypically label him as a basketball player due to his African roots.
Tiger became a phenemenonal golfer due to hard work and his natural talent.
He is proof that your racial makeup does not determine one s athletic ability.
Take Michael Jordan for example; of course he is the greatest basketball player of all time, but people always comment how good he is at golf.
He is a very competitive golfer when he participates in Pro-Am tournaments.
His golf game did not develop until he became a millionaire from playing basketball.
Once he became a part of the upper class, he then could gain membership to country clubs and partake in the sport of golf.
Now that he had the opportunity, he could show people how good he is at golf, even though he is black.
Most people would attribute Jordan s golf skills to his background in basketball and of athletics in general.
Who is to say that any other black person with the opportunity could not demonstrate the same golf ability?
Because of this Michael Jordan example, we argue that other minorities could do well in  country club  sports.
We know Tiger grew up with different circumstances than inner city kids did coming from a suburban area in Cypress CA, but he is a good minority role model to break through in professional golf.
From the news we know that Tiger was pushed by his father to excel in golf, but he still had to face being the only one of color out on the greens for many years.
His family was there for him and encouraged him to continue participating in the sport.
The important thing we need to focus on now since Tiger Woods has become such a superstar, is what good will he do for other minority kids trying to break into country club sports.
Another young rising star in the tennis world that fits well with our topic is Venus Williams.
Her younger sister Serena is also closely following in her footsteps.
Williams comes from an inner city area, Compton CA.
5-30  Training with Serena from a young age under the coaching of their father, these girls are breaking into professional tennis while just in their teens.
Her father has called Venus the  ghetto Cinderella .
Now she is living her dream by competing as a professional.
This is her chance to help her family and herself get out of the inner city and improve her social class.
Venus was fortunate enough to have her sister and her father to help her keep practicing.
This allowed her to always have competition and the helpful motivation that is sometimes needed during training.
Most inner city kids are not as fortunate.
We see how this family is the perfect example, they are black and come from a poor inner city but with the right motivation, both Venus and Serena are now top competitors in the world.
S.
Arthur Ashe  that can afford the membership to the club, the private lessons and expensive equipment.
As we wondered with Tiger, what are these girls going to do with their stardom?
Will they give back to the community and encourage other inner city kids to take a serious interest in their sport?
The Williams  girls have already started to use their stardom to do some good.
Serena and Venus are a true inspiration to all youngsters in this nation.
They both came straight-out of the inner city of Compton, California.
E.
Tiger, Serena, and Venus all are fantastic athletes and role models that have broken into sports which have been dominated by white people for years.
All three give back to the youth in a variety of ways.
However we think if they directed their efforts in other ways or programs, they could help even more inner city kids.
Take Magic Johnson for example.
He came from a poor family and became a millionaire by becoming one of professional basketball s all time greatest.
Now to give back to poor communities like the one he came from, he starts up businesses in the inner city with his own business, Magic Johnson Enterprises.
6- 2  One project of Johnson s is starting a movie theatre complex.
This provides entertainment and jobs for the community.
It also puts all the money back into the community, instead of having people go out of town and pay to see a movie.
I.
Fridays and he also brings them to the inner city, because when the movie is over people need a close place to eat and hang out.
6-2  Magic s entertainment complexes benefit everyone.
We are not suggesting that these athletes mentioned should start opening up businesses in inner cities, but we think if they used their name and implemented programs where kids could learn these  country club  sports which the athletes participate in, it would be very beneficial for the youth.
The athletes could sponsor clinics or tournaments to encourage participation by inner city youth.
The kids could then see Tiger and the Williams  girls on television and then go out and practice to be just like them with other kids that have the same interest.
Hopefully programs sponsored by athletes like the ones mentioned would promote more interest in the  country club  sports.
If kids gain this interest, with a little talent, they could open up many opportunities.
Even if they are not good enough to get a scholarship or become a professional, at least they are having fun doing something healthy and enjoyable.
This is just one example of how athletes can help make life better for the inner city youth.
Existing programs are not doing enough to put inner city youth on the right track towards success.
The programs have the right motives, but they are not producing results.
From both of our experiences we know how athletics help keep kids out of trouble and focused not only on sports but academics too.
Today we see racial domination in sports.
We want to turn kids on to sports not necessarily glamorized by their race or peers, to help make sports an integrated community.
Kids of color are untapped resources in  country club  sports.
We have seen how they can be successful with examples set by Tiger Woods, Venus and Serena Williams, and Arthur Ashe.
We need to direct our efforts to linking inner city youth with role models as have been mentioned to break this gap.
It all has to start with revising existing programs and re-investing money to benefit the cultivation of inner city youth.

MotorSport Ranch is the first of its kind - a Country Club for motoring enthusiasts - including sports cars, race cars, and motorcycles.
Established in 1996, the Ranch introduced and pioneered this new concept.
Just as a golf country club centers its activities around a golf course, this club centers around a purpose-built road racing course.
Two courses, actually, as a second road course has been added to the facility.
Think of MotorSport Ranch as a place that its members go to satisfy that  need for speed .
Many people own a sports or high performance car, or even a vintage race car.
The Ranch is a place to explore the potential of these cars and for the drivers to develop and practice their skills.
The Ranch offers convenience and accessability for its members who do are able to treat performance driving as a sport or a hobby.

Corporex Development Services of Covington, Kentucky was entering the Chicago market with two sports country clubs, one in Burr Ridge and the other in Northbrook.
The mirror-image facilities, representing $22 million in construction, included indoor and outdoor pools, eight indoor tennis courts, eight outdoor tennis courts, racquetball courts, an indoor track, fitness center, gymnasium, restaurants, banquet facilities, nursery, pro shop, hair salon and spa.
Both were to be built at the same time.
While Corporex executives flew in for construction meetings once or twice a month, they wanted day-to-day oversight, as well, to make sure the new facilities conformed to previously opened Five Seasons Country Clubs in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana.
Krusinski Construction Company installed a web-based camera that automatically photographed the two exteriors every 15 minutes.
The photos were posted on the Krusinski web site, providing a visual progress report as the buildings came out of the ground.
In addition, superintendents photographed construction areas that might be of particular note for phone discussion.
The client also received a monthly report that summarized construction and financial progress and provided a photographic overview of the month’s activities.
Corporex was so pleased with the results that when the owners acquired a half-finished hotel in the Chicago area, they hired Krusinski Construction Company to complete the construction job.

Besides the international sports that are practiced in the Basque Country today, the Basques have also developed several unique sports that are still very popular.
Football  soccer for Americans  is by far the most popular game played in the Basque region.
Basketball, cycling and surfing also have quite a large following.
But in addition to these international sports, there are several games that have originated in the Basque Country and are still played today.
The variations of pelota are the most common.
Pelota is similar to racquetball and is played with a ball  call a pelota  which is hit against a fronton  wall .
The most popular form of pelota is also the most minimalistic, called pelota mano and is played without a paddle or racquet.
Only the hand is used to hit the ball against the wall.
Another noteworthy form of pelota is called cesta punta  basket tip .
The pelota that is used in cesta punta is 3 4 the size of a baseball, harder than a golfball and travels up to 170 mph  273 km h .
Basque rural sports, known as herri kirolak, are also popular and important part of the Basque culture.
These sports come from activities that were historically performed on the baserriak  farmsteads .
They usually involve feats of strength or endurance such as carrying heavy stones or chopping wood.
Such strong man competition are common during festivals.

As I watch the Kenyan National Ultimate team practice together for the first time, the excitement is palpable.
The flow is quick and chemistry is converging before my eyes.
Oswe turns and dumps to Allan who swings crisply to Josphat who stomps his right foot while launching a full-field flick to Clement’s streaking frame of prototypical lanky power.
After practice, Clement Masakhwe, a medical student from Kakamega and Team Kenya’s best deep cutter, nervously confesses his addiction: “A week without playing ultimate makes me feel sick – that’s how serious I am into this game.
Representing Kenya at the WCBU 2015 in Dubai is something I’ve started dreaming about every night.
The Kenyan National Ultimate Team is a collection of bright, compassionate and incredibly talented young men from many different parts of Kenya who were selected to play in the World Championships of Beach Ultimate  WCBU  next March in Dubai.
Their ancestral tribal roots are very diverse – the team has players of Luo, Kikuyu, Kisii, and Luhya origins – tribes that have clashed throughout recent history.
But ultimate brings these guys together like nothing else in their lives, working as a team of equals, encouraging and laughing with each other.
Clement started playing ultimate three years ago and has used his football background to progress quickly.
Frisbee is so fun and exciting.
Josphat Nyataya, co-captain of Team Kenya from Nakuru town and a rock-solid handler, “loved the sport at first sight.
He lives in Kisumu and is also the co-captain of Kisumu Frisbee Club, reigning champions of the biggest tournament in East Africa, called FEAST.
Due to its accessibility, ultimate is a perfect sport for low-income places like Kenya.
The only piece of equipment required is a disc, which is inexpensive and lasts for a long time.
In a country where the average annual income is $862, this is a very important point.
As explained by Dr.
John Waitumbi, the senior member of Team Kenya known as ‘Daktari’ by his local teammates: “In Kenya, sports tend to be inaccessible for people from low economic backgrounds.
Al-Karim Mitha, a native Kenyan of Ismaili Muslim Indian heritage, says: “I love that anyone can play this game.
Growing up in Kenya and Canada, I’ve seen and played a lot of different sports, and this one is really special.
Al-Karim is Team Kenya’s friendly giant who will sky players and then buy them a beer.
Be ready.
To those who know it well, ultimate is a symbolic force of peace and friendship.
This aspect is important to Mishael Oswe, a Kisumu native who is emerging as a key versatility player and veteran leader of Team Kenya.
Since he started playing ultimate three years ago, “I have met many new friends both in Kenya and outside the country.
The spirit of the game has been instilled strongly in Kenya and is a highly-cherished part of the sporting experience.
Allan Lemtudo, an enigmatic perpetual joker off the field with incredible on-field tenacity, comes from West Pokot in the arid Northwestern part of Kenya.
It really fascinated me at first that the sport could be played without a referee, with just the spirit of the game.
Moses Braviton, a Nairobi native and Team Kenya’s youngest and quickest player, sees ultimate as much more than just a game, insisting that it has special significance in Kenya: “It is a peacemaking game, which is important here compared to other countries.
Team Kenya’s seven Kenyan-born players have all lived through major violent ethnic conflict in their homeland.
Kenya is home to 42 different tribes of native African Kenyans.
Many of those tribes have a dark and brutal history of violent conflict in the last few decades, fueled by many factors including divisive colonial policies, political manipulation, land and resource scarcity, cattle raiding and terrorism fears, to name a few reasons.
In 1992, 5,000 people were killed and 75,000 displaced  source: UN IRIN  as a result of tribal violence between two tribes, one in the Rift Valley and another in Central Kenya.
More recently, after a disputed election in 2007, Kenya exploded in violence in a chain reaction of politician-instigated escalation.
Election fraud was alleged by both main parties, each backed by supporters along clear and hostile tribal lines.
Peaceful protests gave way to riots, riots gave way to mass murder, and within a few months 1,300 people were killed and about 600,000 displaced  source: Al-Jazeera News .
Political leaders from both sides directly accused each other of ethnic cleansing and genocide, and the resolution was tenuous at best even after international mediation.
In 2014, Kenyans still avoid controversial political discussions, and tribal violence is only mentioned in whispers if at all because the memories are still fresh.
Entire cities hold their breath in fear of chaos whenever divisive political leaders barge into town exploiting historical tribal animosities to boost their own power and sated egos.
Team Kenya’s players see ultimate as being a step in the right direction for the national healing process.
As Clement points out, “Our country’s major undoing has been opposing political stances that fuel ethnic animosity.
Oswe sees valuable lessons in ultimate that can apply to broader society: “We can all learn from the way ultimate is played: on the basis of the spirit of understanding, agreement, sportsmanship and fair play.
Josphat sees the potential for societal benefit if the sport grows: “The Kisumu team has players from at least six different tribes despite the fact that Kisumu is predominantly Luo.
I have been living in Kenya for over a year and I see that these players have some real potential; not only to be great players, but to come back from WCBU 2015 as role models for the whole Kenyan ultimate community and really transform it.
Kenyan players have never played elsewhere so they’ve never had direct exposure to the broader sport.
Beau liked our team’s small Facebook page and mentioned us on his blog, and it was impossible to convey the significance to my teammates.
They have no idea what the AUDL is, why Iberian hat tournaments so crazy fun, and they’ve never played against real American firepower, Japanese small-ball, German precision or Venezuelan flair.
Most importantly, they’ve never experienced the global ultimate community.
It is critical for them be able to see all of this at WCBU 2015 so that they can bring it all back to Kenya and sow the seeds for real grassroots development of the sport in Kenya.
Sustainable development of ultimate in Kenya must be done by Kenyans.
I  and many other expats in the past  have done my best to grow the scene during my time here, but as an outsider, my time and abilities are limited, and my actions are inherently unsustainable.
Kenyan ultimate is now in the hands of my teammates.
They already love ultimate; now they need to experience a world championship.
Team Kenya has raised over $3000 towards their goal of attending WCBU, but still need $6000 to cover travel costs, food and accommodation.

I have never played Ultimate, but I have been a huge fan ever since my daughters took up the sport in high school.
What is not to love about a dynamic, fast-paced, incredibly athletic game that is as much about good sportsmanship as it is about winning?
I am so proud of my son-in-law Mike  the author of this article  who epitomizes the spirit of Ultimate.
Kudos to Mike for bringing the spirit of Ultimate to his adopted Kenyan home.
Thanks for all the positive comments!
Cape Town: When Zimbabwe s players trudged off the Bulawayo pitch after back to back defeats by Afghanistan in July, few could have believed that a month later they would produce a shock victory over Australia.
Sunday s stunning three-wicket win at Harare Sports Club could breath new life into Zimbabwean cricket, showing the possibilities that exist within the team despite the country s cricket history of rolling from crisis to crisis.
Player strikes over unpaid salaries, accusations of corruption within the Zimbabwe Cricket board, the constant changing of coaches and the shrinking of the domestic game from five franchises to four amid desperate cost-cutting have all grabbed recent headlines.
Zimbabwean batsman Sikandar Raza plays a shot during the match against Australia.
But now, finally, there is a positive to fill the back pages and coming as it did just a few days after Zimbabwe had run South Africa uncomfortably close in a losing effort, suggests they are beginning to find some consistency in performance.
The guys worked very hard for this and supporters were behind us throughout.
Elton Chigumbura said at the presentation ceremony on Sunday.
It was a sentiment shared by off-spinner John Nyumbu, new to the side but bowling like a seasoned veteran.
The scenes of jubilation after the game spoke volumes for what the win meant for not just the players, but the supporters who had filled the Harare Sports Club to capacity.
The celebrations provided ample evidence of the passion for the game in the troubled country.
Zimbabwe s 50-over victories against major cricketing nations have not been that rare and since 2010 they have beaten India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, West Indies and now Australia.
It could have been more if the International Cricket Council s  ICC  calendar had allowed them greater opportunity to play.
None of the players that took to the field on Sunday were born the last time Zimbabwe defeated Australia in the opening game of the 1983 World Cup, their first ever one-day international.
With the right support from the country s cricket authorities and the ICC, Zimbabwe can develop further and grow as a team.
