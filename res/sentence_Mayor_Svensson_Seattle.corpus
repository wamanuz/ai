On the half-century anniversary of the Seattle Monorail, more than five years after the end of the last attempt to expand the monorail along a route from Ballard to West Seattle, an activist says it’s time to try again.
This morning the 50th anniversary of the Seattle Monorail’s service is being celebrated, and this morning the board of the newly created Century Transportation Company  “CenTran”  is announcing that it is launching its campaign to create a public transportation authority to build an approximately 16 mile monorail High Capacity Personal Rapid Transit System along the west side transportation corridor of Seattle.
The system will flow from north Ballard, through 15th Avenue NW, swing along the west side of the Seattle Center, then go west to Western Avenue, then run south along the right-of-way of the Alaskan Way Viaduct that is to be vacated, south to 1st Avenue, then west to West Seattle.
CenTran will capitalize on the prior planning, design, and engineering work that was completed for the Seattle Popular Monorail project.
This will particularly ensure the timely planning and construction of this critical transportation system to serve the west side of Seattle.
Initial talks have been started between CenTran and the Mayor Mayor’s office about CenTran’s interest in participating in the transportation planning between Sound Transit and the City of Seattle for a high capacity transportation system in Seattle – monorail is federally recognized by definition and function as a high capacity transportation system, and CenTran’s grade separated feature also fulfills the standard of high capacity transit as it runs in its own dedicated corridor.
A The Authority will be proposing to construct an approximately 16 mile long, dual guideway monorail system between Ballard and West Seattle, in one or more phases.
Board members will be actively involved in all facets of City of Seattle transportation planning work and related regional transportation planning work, in terms of how they relate to CenTran’s transportation system’s goals.
Experience with City of Seattle or Washington state issues, preferably transportation related, or a record of involvement with Seattle neighborhood affairs that includes some transportation matters experience.
From West Seattle to the stadiums or to downtown would be a breeze.
Kudos to WSB for picking this up before the Seattle Transit Blog.
Why not expand the light rail over to west seattle.
Hop the green line to west seattle, transfer to the red line, ballard end point is the blue line, etc.
The average Seattle driver wastes around 44 hours per year sitting in traffic or, in dollar figures, around $1,000 in lost time.
Considering that there are around 900,000 average daily car trips within Seattle, if you factor in the additional savings from fuel, automotive maintenance, insurance, medical bills and court costs from accidents, etc.
I have always liked the thought of a monorail from West Seattle.
Oh wait let me guess by adding a fee to car tabs, and how will you make the steet grade up the hill into West Seattle?
Just have run from West Seattle to the stadium area!
All West Seattle needs is a rail branch a lousy four miles away at the SODO light rail station.
I’m a Seattle native and I wonder if sometime in the last several decades or so the ENTIRE city of what used to be generally practical common sense people was replaced with utopian dreamers out of touch with reality.
If anything should be considered it is whether light rail can come to west Seattle but I have heard the bridge cannot support a surface alignment, structurally.
Ballard to West Seattle, Ballard to UW to Bellevue, West Seattle to Beacon to Mercer Island Bellevue.
There should be some kind of light rail from west Seattle to downtown.
But there are always pros and cons, you can not ever get it all with one technology…the question is, which is right for the W Seattle to Ballard corridor.
Stay out of the Seattle center, Design duel tracks along the entire length incl the W Sea Bridge, and hands off the old monorail.
Apparently Unsound Transit has a plan to “study” a light rail line in West Seattle.
I’m sorry but the Seattle Monorail is a tourist attraction, plain and simple and should not be expanded.
Ill vote for any train-based transit to w Seattle.
The ease with which a person can travel without being in a bus or light rail at grade, such as the elevated Metro in Washington DC or Subway in New York – I say yes for Seattle.
We need realists transit options here in war Seattle.
My husband and I go between West Seattle and Ballard frequently.
I, and many people I know, would use a system running from Ballard to West Seattle though downtown at least three times a week.
Is she any sort of decision maker in the Seattle government?
Do the majority of people in Seattle actually care what she has to say?
In fact, when it comes to Seattle, I bet more people care about the season premiere of “The Killing” more than they care about what she has to say.
The West Seattle Bridge may not be structurally efficient to build it there.
I would be happy with a “Park-n-Ride” in West Seattle  NOT Burien!
It is amazing to read  how many are not up to date on improvements of monorail technology since the Seattle Alweg was built 50 years ago.
Professional presentations of the Urbanaut has been proposed across 520 Bridge,the Alaska Viaduct,the West Seattle -Ballard new routes handling many more riders not the old ones .
Why not try and work with existing agencies to build light rail to West Seattle.
There are proven success stories of light rail and monorail systems around the world, but Seattle already has a successful light rail infrastructure including maintenance facilities, existing routes, extra train cars, trained workers, and most importantly: room for expansion.
Perhaps Seattle Transit and Elizabeth could learn from each other and develop an integrated transit system that provides transportation options for citizens built with budget-sensitive capital costs.
I believe the 4 miles of track to connect west Seattle to the existing SODO light rail station could be built quite inexpensively when compared to a new monorail system.
If the Monorail project would not have been killed in 2005, we would have a line running from West Seattle to Crown Hill TODAY!
Just think, not having to worry about: $5 gal gas, limited parking downtown, viaduct demolition tunnel construction, West Seattle Bridge traffic headaches, easy access to CenturyLink & Safeco, a new NBA Arena in SoDo could be built because parking traffic would not be an issue, etc.
Too bad Seattle doesn’t have any ‘vision’ or balls to pull the trigger on soemthing needed.
WSB covers West Seattle 24 7, with your help.
Mayor Mike McGinn and Deputy Chief Dick Reed announced changes in the Seattle Police Department s regulations for new recruits.
SEATTLE -- While you probably won t see officers with Mike-Tyson facial tattoos smoking joints while on bike patrol, the Seattle Police Department has loosened some of its regulations for new recruits in an effort to employ officers who better reflect the community they serve.
According to Mayor Mike McGinn, who announced the changes Monday morning in Beacon Hill, the city plans on hiring more than 300 new police officers over the next five years.
The Seattle Police Department is also hoping to increase the diversity of its officers by partnering with community organizations, such as the Atlantic Street Center, Filipino Community of Seattle and El Centro De La Raza, and hosting community-based workshops to prepare possible new recruits.
Yet another reason to steer clear of the rat-hole that Seattle has become.
No problem, the City of Seattle has a place for you!
Since they have a lower standard for becoming Mayor of Seattle, McGinn thought it would make since to lower the standards for SPD too.
While the mayor etc Â are loosening disfigurement requirements how about removing any weight restrictions on new recruits?
That mayor of yours is simply crazy-town.
Diversity is always great especially in Seattle.
Perhaps Seattle voters ought to do the same thing that King Co.
Just when you thought Seattle s ethics, morals and standards couldn t sink any lower.
Yoda Seattle is know for pot, riots, hit n runs, assaults, murders.
BrodyRodyPartDeux Â  I ll have to open another restaurant within the Seattle City limits to feed the cops with the muchies.

On the   morning of March 8, 1970, two half-mile long columns of vehicles began   forming in a south Seattle neighborhood.
The vehicles moved north towards   Seattle’s Magnolia neighborhood and the recently decommissioned Fort Lawton   Army installation.
When the   caravans reached their destinations, both the north and south sides of Fort   Lawton, the occupants of the cars launched a coordinated effort to occupy   the fort and establish it as a cultural and social services center for   Seattle’s growing Native American population.
The Fort Lawton invasion was a response to the declining state   of Native reservations and to the challenges faced by Seattle’s growing   urban Indian population, as well as the government’s apparent lack of   concern for either.
For Natives in Seattle, there were few places to   turn for help in an often new and unfamiliar urban setting.
By the late sixties, the city of Seattle was at least marginally   aware of the need to address the problems of urban Indians.
In 1969, the   city assigned Blair Paul, a young University of Washington Law School   graduate who was working as a Seattle Human Rights Department officer, to   address the problem.
War on Poverty programs meant that millions of dollars were coming into   Seattle for minorities, but Indians were receiving none of these funds.
I was hired by the Department to focus on the   needs of urban Indians in Seattle.
In   1961 Whitebear moved to Seattle where he began organizing events to make   Native concerns more visible to the White population and also creating   cultural activities to help affirm traditional Native identity among urban   Indians.
He was aware of the political climate of Seattle during the mid to late sixties   and saw it as an opportunity to press Native grievances.
Although   unsuccessful in this regard, their methods influenced and inspired   discontented and frustrated urban Indians around the country, including   Seattle.
Whitebear returned from Alcatraz with an even stronger   awareness of the need for a new, more radical approach in Seattle.
Under the new law, the city of Seattle was eligible to acquire Fort Lawton   at little to no cost.
In March of 1970, Whitebear was the   leader of a growing number of younger urban Indians who were tired of the   misrepresentation of the American Indian in Seattle politics and frustrated   by the city’s unwillingness to negotiate.
As he later wrote, the “‘Moccasin Telegraph’ worked surprisingly well and   within days numbers of supporters began arriving in Seattle.
The night before the invasion, drawing on   the connections of his heritage, Whitebear organized a powwow at the   Filipino Community hall in south Seattle, both to celebrate the coming   operations and to communicate to as many people as possible the plans for   the invasion.
The MPs requested help from Fort Lewis and armed troops soon arrived   alongside squads of Seattle police officers.
When Seattle Times reporter Don Hannula reached Bernie   Whitebear for comment, Whitebear said that the third occupation was “an   effort to reaffirm Indian demands that surplus designated Fort Lawton land   be turned over for a multipurpose and education center.
As Whitebear wrote, “the invasions and   occupations had achieved one major objective, gaining commitments of support   from the local residents of Seattle.
Whitebear was advised by attorneys Garry Bass and Blair Paul   to form an organization that could be seen as representative of the Natives   in Seattle during the negotiations to come.
Frances Svensson and others, successfully convinced Bruce   to place a hold on Fort Lawton lands, thereby preserving their status as   “surplus” federal land, until further negotiations could be completed.
The temporary hold enabled the UIATF to make an application   for part of the property prior to the city of Seattle’s application through   the Department of the Interior.
This early application put the UIATF on   equal ground with the city of Seattle in the eyes of the General Services   Administration, which was responsible for final disposal of federal surplus   property.
The early application reportedly enraged Mayor Uhlman, who had   been lobbying for the property for years.
As one negotiator pointed out to the Seattle Post Intelligencer, “Jackson turned on the Heat.
In March of 1973 the city of Seattle designated   $500,000 of its general revenue sharing funds for the development of the   cultural center.
And the militant nature of the protest caused dissension within Seattle’s   Indian community along generational lines.
Alongside the Alcatraz takeover, it   signaled to the city of Seattle and the nation that urban Indians would   fight for rights, redress, and respect by any means necessary.
Equally important, the Daybreak Star   Center filled, and continues to fill, a vital place in Seattle’s Native   community as both a provider of essential social services and a preserver of   Native history and culture.

SEATTLE -- After a demotion to captain that lasted all of two months, Nick Metz has been reinstated as assistant chief at the Seattle Police Department, according to a Jan.
As assistant chief under Bailey, who was picked by new Mayor Ed Murray to replace Pugel earlier this month, Metz will head the Field Support Bureau.
Jim Dermody as head of the West Precinct, which includes Downtown Seattle.
I find it odd that the Seattle branch of the NAACP does not have any comment regarding SPD s personnel shakeup.
The fact that the new mayor reinstated Metz is more than a little concerning.
I live outside of Seattle so I really don t give a rip what they do but I m sure their decisions influence nearby areas.
Tuesday , it s Seattle so it should be easy to figure it out.

Judges  comments: The  Seattle Times revealed the tragic problems that evolved from an effort to give frail  Washington residents an alternative to nursing homes – and save the state  money.
Judges  comments: Showing it never hurts to tell a  story with humor, even in a financial investigation, this informative piece by  freelancer Aram Roston and Observer reporters Reid Pillifant and Azi Paybarah details how New York City’s mayor is  encouraging city residents to invest and pay taxes, but has millions of his own  dollars tucked away in off-shore tax shelters.
The judges commend the reporters  for finding and obtaining the documentation about the mayor s investments.
Judges  comments: This follow-up on The Seattle Times’ original Pulitzer  Prize Breaking News coverage of the killing of four police officers in a  Seattle suburb is a darkly fascinating tale of the man behind the killings and  the system that failed to keep him behind bars.

ESBJÖRN SVENSSON:                    DIÁLOGOS EN MARTES.
Arturo Mora entrevistó, en exclusiva, al pianista Esbjörn                      Svensson para Tomajazz.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Realmente no hay nada                      que decir aparte de escuchar la música, lo cual es,                      por supuesto, una respuesta muy aburrida, pero por eso hacemos                      música, porque no somos poetas ni nada de eso, no necesitamos                      utilizar muchas palabras.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Todo lo que se oye en                      el álbum ha salido de una forma muy natural.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Por supuesto que lo hace,                      pero especialmente en E.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: No estoy seguro de estar                      de acuerdo.
Habrá muchas partes de la música                      que suenen más compuestas que improvisadas, pero también                      puede ser como dices, la verdad es que no estoy seguro de                      si hay un porcentaje mayor de material compuesto que improvisado.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Creo que cuando compongo                      intento pensar en cómo podemos tocar las cosas, y eso                      no nos causa una gran diferencia: si funciona en el estudio                      funciona en directo, y si funciona en directo funciona en                      el estudio.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Bueno, Ake Linton es                      un hombre muy, muy importante en este proceso.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Esa composición                      realmente se originó con el riff que toca                      la mano izquierda en el piano  canta el riff .
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Sí, por supuesto.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Puede ser, puede ser.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Estuvo bien, tocamos                      en junio conciertos, clubes, festivales en Filadelfia, Rochester,                      Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle –en un par de sitios                      distintos–, también subimos a Canadá,                      y creo que fue un gran éxito, lo pasamos muy bien y,                      en general, cuando, al principio, cuando empezamos a tocar                      en Estados Unidos era muy difícil hacer que la gente                      fuera a los conciertos, porque éramos totalmente desconocidos                      y a veces tocábamos para muy poca gente, pero parece                      que afortunadamente esos días ya pasaron y viene a                      vernos mucho público, más o menos allá donde toquemos, lo cuál es fantástico, ser europeos                      e ir a Estados Unidos a tocar jazz.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Lo es, es fantástico.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: No sé, es decir.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Sí, hoy no estamos tan aislados                      en Europa, como si nosotros estuviéramos tocando para                      los europeos y en Estados Unidos tocasen para ellos.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Sin duda Jorge Rossy,                      de España.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: La verdad es que no,                      cuando estamos de gira prefiero escuchar música clásica.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Siempre contamos con                      hacerlo todo los tres miembros, e incluyendo también                      a Ake, los cuatro.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Estoy constantemente                      intentando tocar algo de música clásica, hoy                      mismo estaba tocando a Beethoven, algunas sonatas en las que                      estoy trabajando, porque me gusta mucho esa música,                      pero también me encanta Johann Sebastian Bach, Chopin,                      alguna vez toco algo de Mozart y.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Me encantaría,                      siempre es un placer tocar en España, pero por lo que                      sé, no pasará nada quizás hasta la primavera,                      no creo que podamos hacer algo antes.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Realmente es difícil                      saberlo.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: Estaba intentando recordar                      el nombre del pianista.
ESBJÖRN SVENSSON: ¡Espera un segundo!
