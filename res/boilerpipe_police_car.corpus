A CHP Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle .
This is one of the many vehicle models replacing the discontinued Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor after 2013 in many American jurisdictions.
A police car is a ground vehicle used by police , to assist with their duties in patrolling and responding to incidents.
Typical uses of a police car include transportation for officers to reach the scene of an incident quickly, to transport suspects , or to patrol an area, while providing a high visibility deterrent to crime.
The first police car was a wagon run by electricity fielded on the streets of Akron, Ohio , in 1899.
The first operator of the police patrol wagon was Akron Police officer Louis Mueller, Sr.
It could reach 16 mph  26 km h  and travel 30 mi  48 km  before its battery needed to be recharged.
1] The car was built by city mechanical engineer Frank Loomis.
The US$ 2,400 vehicle was equipped with electric lights, gongs and a stretcher.
The car s first assignment was to pick up a drunken man at the junction of Main and Exchange streets.
Terms for police cars include  police  cruiser, squad car, area car and patrol car.
In some places, a police car may also be informally known as a cop car, a black and white , a cherry top , a gumball machine, a jam sandwich or panda car .
Depending on the configuration of the emergency lights and livery, a police car may be considered a marked or unmarked unit.
In some areas of the world, the police car has become more widely used than police officers  walking the beat .
This is because there has been a shift in the focus of policing away from high visibility with  an officer on every street corner  to more focused services, sending officers out in response to incidents, and also allowing patrols to cover a much greater area in less time.
Placing officers in vehicles also allows them to carry more equipment, such as automated external defibrillators for people in cardiac arrest or road cones for traffic obstructions, and allows for more immediate transport of suspects to holding facilities.
Vehicles also allow for the transport of larger numbers of personnel, such as a SWAT team.
Advocates of community policing often cite this shift into vehicles, and away from face to face contact, as a reason for breakdowns in relations with the community.
As such, these organizations often ask police departments to encourage officers to spend less time in their vehicles and more time walking the streets and interacting with the community.
This has led to some countries and forces, such as those in the United Kingdom , introducing more walking patrols, using either fully sworn Police Officers or Police Community Support Officers .
Decommissioned police cars are often sold to the general public, either through a police auction or a private seller, after about 3–5 years of use.
Such cars are usually sold relatively cheaply due to the extremely high mileage on such cars, in some cases exceeding the 300,000-mile  480,000 km  mark.
In some cases, the cars are re-purposed as a taxicab as an inexpensive way for cab companies to buy cars instead of fleet vehicle services.
In all cases, the cars are stripped of their police markings as well as most internal equipment; however the engines are usually left intact, and are often larger engines than their civilian counterparts.
Hyundai Sonata patrol car in South Korea.
The car that replaces walking for the  beat  police officer .
3] Their primary function is to convey normal police officers between their duties  such as taking statements or visiting warnings .
Patrol cars are also able to respond to emergencies,  and as such are normally fitted with visual and audible warnings.
A response car is similar to a patrol car, but is likely to be of a higher specification, capable of faster speeds, and will certainly be fitted with audible and visual warnings.
These cars are usually only used to respond to emergency incidents, so are designed to travel fast, and may carry specialist equipment, such as large firearms.
In the UK, each station usually only has one, which is called an area car .
Also known as Road Policing Units , these cars are designed for the job of enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road.
They may be fitted with special bumpers designed to force vehicles off the road, and may have visual and audible warnings, with special audible warnings which can be heard from a greater distance.
In some police forces, the term traffic car may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws.
As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones and flares, and traffic control signs.
Some police forces do not distinguish between patrol, response and traffic cars, and may use one vehicle to fulfill some or all roles even though in some cases this may not be appropriate  such as a police city vehicle in a motorway high speed pursuit chase .
These cars are usually a compromise between the different functions with elements added or removed.
An Australian  Dog Unit  car based on a pickup truck in New South Wales in January 2007.
SUVs and Pickups are used for a variety of reasons; off-road needs, applications where a lot of equipment must be carried, K-9 units, etc.
This is a standard production car, visibly marked, but without audible and visual warning devices.
It is used by community police officers to show a presence, and to transport them between jobs.
These cars do not respond to emergencies.
Many forces also operate unmarked cars, in any of the roles shown above, but most frequently for the use of traffic enforcement or detectives .
They have the advantage of not being immediately recognisable, and are a valuable tool in catching criminals while the crime is still taking place.
S.
However, not all unmarked police cars have government license plates.
S.
This type of car is used to transport police dogs .
In some jurisdictions, this will be a station wagon or car based van, due to the installation of cages to carry the dogs.
These units may also be known as K9 units  a homophone of canine, also used to refer to the animals themselves .
These cars are typically marked in order to warn people that there is a police dog on board.
Forces may operate surveillance cars.
These cars can be marked or unmarked, and are there to gather evidence of any criminal offence.
Overt marked cars may have CCTV cameras mounted on the roof to discourage wrongdoing, whereas unmarked cars would have them hidden inside.
This type of vehicle is particularly common in the United Kingdom .
Some police forces use vehicles  or sometimes fake  cut outs  of vehicles  to deter crime.
They may be old vehicles retired from use, stock models restyled as police cars, or a metal sign made to look like a police car.
They are placed in areas thought to be susceptible to crime in order to provide a high visibility presence without committing an officer.
Examples of these can be seen on many main roads, freeways and motorways.
In 2005, Virginia  s   United States   legislature considered a bill which stated, in part:  Whenever any law-enforcement vehicle is permanently taken out of service ... such vehicle shall be placed at a conspicuous location within a highway median in order to deter violations of motor vehicle laws at that location. Such vehicles shall ... be rotated from one location to another as needed to maintain their deterrent effect. ;  Such cars may also be used in conjunction with manned units hidden further down the road to trick speeders into speeding back up again, and being clocked by the manned car.
In Chicago , Illinois a small fleet of highly visible vans are parked alongside major state and federal routes with automated speed detection and camera equipment, monitoring both for speeders and other offenders by license plate.
Tickets are then mailed to the offenders or, in case of other crimes related to the licensed owner, may be served by a manned vehicle further down the road.
Police forces may operate cars used to trap criminals who are stealing cars  by carjacking , breaking in or other means .
The car is taken to a place where it is known to be at risk of theft, and allowed to be stolen.
The police then track the vehicle, and can disable the engine and lock the doors by remote control.
The same technique can be used to place portable items of value such as GPS units with an inbuilt tracker.
In some jurisdictions, the police may operate a rescue service, and special units will be required for this.
In jurisdictions where the police are responsible for, or participate in, explosive ordnance disposal squads  bomb squads , dedicated vehicles transport the squads  crews and equipment.
Cars which are not for active duty, but simply for display.
E.
These vehicles could be divided into three sub-categories.
Modified trucks equipped with water cannons, modified stock cars and modified APCs   Armored Personnel Carriers  .
Their function is to help control riots.
Modified stock cars will have caged windows for protection against objects thrown at them and could include mini-buses, 4x4s or prisoner transport vans.
APCs usually will not require any added protection but their modifications might include some sort of tear gas ejecting method or shields that unfold to create barriers.
The water cannon vehicles are used either to break up riots or extinguish fires set by the rioters.
Although plain water is usually used some variations might include tear gas or special dye  to mark the people that are present for later apprehension .
Previously[ when?
The police car on the left is fitted with a lightbar, making it instantly recognizable as a police vehicle.
Police cars are usually passenger car models which are upgraded to the specifications required by the purchasing force.
Several vehicle manufacturers, such as Ford , General Motors and Dodge , provide a  police package  option, which is built to police specifications in the factory.
Police forces may add to these modifications by adding their own equipment and making their own modifications after purchasing a vehicle.
Modifications a police car might undergo include adjustments for higher durability, speed, high mileage driving and long periods of idling at a higher temperature.
This is usually accomplished by heavy duty suspension , brakes , calibrated speedometer , tires , alternator , transmission and cooling systems , and also sometimes includes slight modifications to the car s stock engine or the installation of a more powerful engine than would be standard in that model.
It is also usual to upgrade the capacity of the electrical system of the car to accommodate the use of additional electronic equipment.
Police vehicles are often outfitted with AED s   Automated external defibrillator  , first aid kits, fire extinguishers, flares, life buoys, barrier tapes, etc.
Police vehicles are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or position on the road.
In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws  such as the right to exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a yield sign  and may also suggest a duty on other motorists to move out of the direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution.
Visual warnings on a police car can be of two types: either passive or active.
Passive visual warnings are the markings on the vehicle.
Police vehicle markings usually make use of bright colours or strong contrast with the base colour of the vehicle.
Modern police vehicles in some countries have retroreflective markings which reflect light for better visibility at night.
Other police vehicles may only have painted on or non-reflective markings.
Most marked police vehicles in the United Kingdom and Sweden have reflective Battenburg markings on the sides, which are large blue and yellow rectangles.
14] These markings are designed to have high contrast and be highly visible on the road, to deter crime and improve safety.
Another passive visual warning of police vehicles is simply the interceptor s silhouette.
This is easily observed in the United States, where the ubiquitous nature of the Ford Crown Victoria in police fleets has made the model synonymous with police vehicles.
Police vehicle marking schemes usually include the word Police or similar phrase  such as State Trooper or Highway Patrol  or the force s crest.
Some police forces use unmarked vehicles, which do not have any passive visual warnings at all, and others  called stealth cars  have markings that are visible only at certain angles, such as from the rear or sides, making these cars appear unmarked when viewed from the front.
The active visual warnings are usually in the form of flashing colored lights  also known as   beacons   or   lightbars   .
These flash in order to attract the attention of other road users as the police car approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped vehicle in a dangerous position on the road.
Common colours for police warning beacons are blue and red, however this often varies by force.
Several types of flashing lights are used, such as rotating beacons , halogen lights , or light emitting diode strobes .
Some police forces also use arrow sticks to direct traffic, or message display boards to provide short messages or instructions to motorists.
The headlights of some vehicles can be made to flash , or small strobe lights can be fitted in the headlight, tail light and indicator lights of the vehicle.
In addition to visual warnings, most police cars are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens , which can alert people and vehicles to the presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen.
The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the car.
A later development was the rotating air siren , which made noise when air moved past it.
Most modern vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different noises.
Police driving training often includes the use of different noises depending on traffic conditions and manoeuvre being performed.
In North America for instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the  wail  setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a  yelp  setting may be preferred, which is a sped up version of the  wail .
Some vehicles may also be fitted with airhorn audible warnings.
Also in some European countries, where a hi-lo two tone siren is the only permitted siren for emergency vehicles, a  stadt  siren will be used in cities where it has loud echo that can be heard from blocks away to warn the traffic an emergency vehicle is coming, or a  land  siren will be used on highways to project its noise to the front to produce more penetration into the vehicles ahead to alert the drivers.
A development is the use of the RDS system of car radios , whereby the vehicle can be fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, in the manner of a traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message  as with traffic broadcasts .
This feature is built into all RDS radios for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence, although is not able to alert pedestrians, non-RDS radio users, or drivers with their radios turned off.
A new technology has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police.
Called the Rumbler, it is a siren that emits a low frequency sound which can be felt.
Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler.
The feeling is that of standing next to a large speaker with pumped bass.
Many forces have moved from traditional UHF   VHF sets, which can be monitored externally, to more secure systems, such as those working on a GSM system, such as TETRA .
These are used to house two way radios, light switches, and siren switches.
Some may be equipped with locking compartments for safe storage of firearms or file compartments.
These are steel and plastic barriers which ensure that a suspect—who has been frisked, disarmed, handcuffed and seat belted, is unable to attack the driver or passenger and unable to tamper with equipment in the front seat.
These may be simple bars or grilles, although they can include highly impact resistant but not bullet resistant glass.
Many use expanded steel instead of plastic glazing for the upper half of the partition.
In certain countries, including the United States, some police vehicles are equipped with lockers or locking racks in which to store firearms.
These are usually tactical firearms such as shotguns or patrol rifles , which would not normally be carried on the person of the officer.
Police vehicles can be fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside or outside the car.
They may also be fitted with sound recording facilities.
Some police cars are fitted with devices to measure the speed of vehicles being followed, such as ProViDa , usually through a system of following the vehicle between two points a set distance apart.
This is separate to any radar gun device which is likely to be handheld, and not attached to the vehicle.
This enables officers in the front to remotely control the rear locks—usually used in conjunction with a transport enclosure.
The Pursuit Intervention Technique  PIT  bumper attaches to the front frame of a patrol car.
It is designed to end vehicle pursuits by spinning the fleeing vehicle with a nudge to the rear quarter panel.
Cars not fitted with a PIT Bumper can still attempt a PIT Maneuver at risk of increased front-end damage and possible disablement if the maneuver fails and the pursuit continues.
Fitted to the chassis of the car and located to augment the front bumper, to allow the car to be used as a battering ram for simple structures or fences, or to push disabled vehicles off the road.
This allows the vehicle s engine to be left running without the keys being in the ignition.
This enables adequate power, without battery drain, to be supplied to the vehicle s equipment at the scene of a major incident.
The vehicle can only be driven off after re-inserting the keys.
If the keys are not re-inserted, the engine will switch off if the handbrake is disengaged or the footbrake is activated.
The installation of this equipment in a car partially transforms it into a desk.
Police officers use their car to fill out different forms, print documents, type on a computer or a console, consult and read different screens, etc.
Ergonomics in layout and installation of these items in the police car plays an important role in the comfort and safety of the police officers at work and preventing injuries such as back pain and musculoskeletal disorders.
Police chases have been dramatized in television programs and movies, and occasionally feature in television news coverage of unusual circumstances, showing footage from an airborne camera.
In film and television fiction, police cars are usually portrayed as containing a team of two police officers so that they may converse and interact on screen.
In reality, most districts  especially rural and low population  have only one police officer per vehicle, although at night this may increase to two.

Our simple goal at the National Police Car Archives is to present law enforcement vehicles from every single agency in the United States of America.
There are 17,985 agencies in the USA  as of 2008, not counting part-time and privately funded agencies  covering everything from the smallest village, to the largest cities; from colleges and universities, to metropolitan transit and parks systems.
We hope to achieve this ambitious goal with the major help of outside submissions along with the work of the site s webmaster.

A Ford Crown Victoria of the Los Angeles Police Department is seen here responding from the Hollywood Police Station.
The exit used by the police cars is also used by the two ambulances of the LAFD, Rescue 27 and Rescue 827 which are housed at the LAFD Firehouse 27 just next to the police station.

Compared to the average model, police cars drink a lot of gas, idle for hours on end and generally take more abuse than any other vehicle on the road.
But they also often last far longer, and offer an exceptionally nice firm ride.
On a dollar-for-dollar basis they are perhaps the cheapest used vehicles on the road — and if you don t drive that much, they can be well worth it.
However, you have to do a lot of homework to find the good ones among the many badly abused ones.
So do you still want to even think about buying a Police Interceptor in Ford , Chevy or Dodge form?
First you have to find a city or agency selling one, and while many post their excess vehicles online, it can be harder than you may think.
32 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptors.
There was just one small catch: Most people couldn t bid on any of them, as it was an auction for dealers and salvage pickers only.
My advice is to first start with realistic expectations.
Some of these vehicles have been sitting at a backlot for weeks, months, even years after they were last on the road.
You will almost definitely have to replace the battery, which means that if you want to inspect the vehicle in person, which I strongly advise you do, bring a jump box.
There is also a pecking order when it comes to Police Interceptors.
Police cars that are used in the line of duty typically have a cloth front-seat, vinyl back-seat combination and you will see wires and holes wherever there was police equipment.
On a purely cosmetic level, black and white versions of these vehicles tend to be less expensive at the auctions than all black models, or other single color variations such as white or silver.
Most public buyers prefer all black police cars and, as a long-time car dealer, I find that these black beauties are usually far easier to retail.
A step up from both of them is the Police Interceptor that has a cloth interior and none of the hanging wires or gaping holes of the active duty models .
These vehicles tend to be abused far less and are used by government employees or, in certain cases, police officials that don t engage in high-speed pursuits.
These cars will go for more money due to their lower mechanical wear and their retail-ready interiors.
Police equipment also typically adds value to the selling price.
Push bumpers, spotlights, rear window bars, and the rare model with a complete rear cage all add value to the sale.
I always encourage folks to focus on no more than two vehicles, inspect the vehicles with a knowledgeable person before you bid, and try to find out as much about the maintenance history as you can.
Online descriptions of these vehicles are usually garbage, but sometimes there is a silver lining under that cloud of misinformation.
Sometimes you get lucky and find yourself with a vehicle well worth the risk.
Earlier this year, I bought a 2000 Ford Crown Victoria from the City of Atlanta for just $700.
It had a rare leather interior, which typically means that it was driven by a city councilperson, a fire chief, or some other important public official who typically doesn t abuse vehicles.
I was the only bidder of this supposedly inoperable car which, according to the online listing, showed well over 200,000 miles on the odometer.
A quick Carfax search yielded a mileage reading of only around 110,000 miles.
I brought a jump box to where the vehicle was located and, miracle of miracles, the car started right up.
My net proceeds for that vehicle were a bit over $7,000.
Of course, there are some busts in the ex-police car game.
Not everything you buy turns out to be good.
Ford Crown Vics in particular have become the  almost car  when it comes retailing used cars.
It s the car that everyone says they  kinda  want, but never buy.
A full-sized, gas-guzzling V8, with rear-wheel drive, and more cheap plastic bits than the off-brand Lego store usually doesn t translate into a highly sought-after used car.
Throw in exposed wires from all the police-only parts that were removed, couple that with well worn seats, and you wind up with a car that is sometimes bought for as little as 10 percent of its original purchase price after seven years.
The ones that the City of Roswell had listed on Govdeals were older and cheaper.
I hate closed markets with a passion, especially when it comes to cars.
So I decided to open up this market a bit by offering my friends on Facebook the opportunity to use me as their bidder for these vehicles.
After 15 years of inspecting, appraising and liquidating government vehicles, I knew what they should expect.
Most of these Police Interceptors would sell right around the $1,000 mark with maybe a few going upwards of $1,500 to $1,800.
At the end of the day, four cars were bid on and two were bought.
Each were 2003 models that sold for about $1,300.
They will likely need about $300 to $700 worth of work in the form of alternators, tires, and other minor catch-up maintenance.
Both had front and rear cloth seats, and both were worth the selling price.
But, as you can see, it took a long time to get there.
So if you want a cop car, take your time,  and please, try to avoid locking yourself in the back seat .

A suspect stole a police cruiser and led police on a 20-minute chase through northwest Houston Friday night.
HOUSTON – A 15-year-old suspect is in custody tonight after stealing a Houston police car and leading police on a chase through northwest Houston.
Police say the boy stole a police cruiser while an officer was assisting a victim out of another after an accident near Fairbanks North Houston and proceeded to lead police on a 20-minute chase.
Police said the suspect was involved in that earlier crash.
The chase ended when the suspect lost control and crashed the squad car on West Little York near Deep Forest.
The boy attempted to flee on foot, police said, but was quickly apprehended.
Police haven t determined why the boy stole the squad car.
Here in America, we’re all well-aware that police departments are constantly upgrading their hardware, getting the newest, biggest and baddest technology available.
It’s not terribly uncommon to see local and state authorities putting powerful muscle cars to use patrolling the highways, like Dodge Chargers, Ford Mustangs or even the occasional Chevy Corvette.
While most police cruisers stick to classic models like the Crown Victoria or Ford Taurus, some departments around the world look to be gearing up for a street race rather than fighting crime.
In certain places around the world, like in Dubai for example, money has completely changed the cultural landscape.
Supercars are fixtures on every street, and residents feel perfectly okay with hitting insane speeds.
You might remember a recent episode in which Justin Bieber was speeding and driving recklessly through the city.
Well, that behavior is all too common in cities like Dubai, and as a result, police departments have stacked their arsenal to combat it.
Here are the ten fastest police cars in the world, specially-created to serve the needs of the boys in blue in specific areas all over the world.
Some are used as actual patrol vehicles, others merely for show.
One thing is for sure: the police aren’t cutting any corners in their battle to keep dangerous driving at bay.
Read on to see the world’s ten fastest police cars.
10.
A Lexus   NYSE:TM   IS-F was built to help policemen in the UK tackle citizen’s speeding habits, and with a top speed of 168 miles per hour, it’s capable of keeping up with most other cars.
Used in northern England by the Humberside Police, this 416 horsepower beast is mostly used as a deterrent, but is also used to run down criminals and speeders in super high-speed sports cars.
The next time you find yourself resisting the urge to hit the gas in northern England, trust your instincts.
9.
5 seconds.
The Atom actually ties with one other model on the list for the quickest police car in the world, and probably sends an incredible message to speeders with its Formula 1 styling.
It’s hard to think there’s a cooler police car out there, but as you’ll see, other countries have mounted quite a supercar cache to deter lawbreakers.
8.
Police in the Netherlands have one of the more unique cop cars in the world, with a Spyker C8 Spyder.
While the standard version is pictured above, the police have the province of Flevoland welcomed the C8 Spyder to the force in 2008.
5 seconds, speeders all over the Netherlands have something to fear.
Spyker is a Dutch-based car maker, so it’s fitting to keep one of their impressive supercars right at home.
7.
2 seconds.
2-liter V10 engine to be able to make 620 horsepower, above the standard 518.
The car, however, has not been put on patrol or used to deter crime.
It is used only for show, but still makes an attractive component to the police’s armory.
Police in Italy were the happy recipients of a brand new Lamborghni, donated by the Lamborghini company itself as an anniversary gift, celebrating 152 years for the department in 2004.
Four years later, the company donated a new Gallardo LP560-4, which was put to use patrolling Italy’s highways.
7 seconds.
2-liter V10 engine to produce 560 horsepower, giving some bite to the Italian police’s road presence.
Since then, the Italian Polizia have also taken shipment of a new Lamborghini Hurácan, Lambo’s replacement for the aging Gallardo.
5.
You’ll learn one thing very quickly while reading through this list: don’t mess with the Dubai Police Department.
7 seconds.
The FF is one of a handful of supercars used by the Dubai PD, but this is the only one driven exclusively by female officers.
It was added to the Dubai PD’s fleet in the spring of 2013, and adds even more teeth to the police’s supercar supply.
4.
If you had to guess as to what city’s police department adopted a Lambroghini Aventador LP 700-4, who would it be?
Of course, you should have guessed Dubai!
Along with several other super cars, this Lamborghini joins the ranks of Dubai’s finest with its insane capabilities and fighter jet physique.
9 seconds.
Beware if you think about speeding through the United Arab Emirates, as this impressive machine isn’t even the most formidable vehicle in the Dubai PD’s fleet.
3.
The Dubai PD is at it again, this time picking up one of the more rare cars in the world.
The car itself is aptly-named, as only 77 were built, and now one has been modified into a crime-fighting machine.
5 seconds and tops out at 220 miles per hour.
With all the money flying around Dubai, the police decided to up the ante with a few supercars of their own to combat the wild driving habits of the super wealthy.
This One-77 is merely one part of their arsenal.
2.
The Brabus Rocket is a suped-up Mercedes model, that can keep up with almost any other car out there.
3-liter V12 powered car is now outfitted for the boys in blue.
2 seconds, this Brabus Rocket is actually not built for street patrols.
The German Secretary of Transportation instead took it onboard to be the face of a program meant to inspire people to modify their cars responsibly, and drive safe.
1.
The Dubai Police decided that what they already had in stock just wasn’t enough, so they decided to go and get themselves the second-fastest car in the world, the Bugatti Veyron.
The Dubai police apparently need a car that can chase down anything else on the road, as the Veyron is, of course, the official world record holder for fastest car in the world.
5 seconds, there’s no way anything can get out of the Veyron’s grasp, unless a Hennessey Venom GT shows up.
6 million, but hey, it’s Dubai!

A Pennsylvania woman tried to steal an unmarked police car — with two officers sitting inside it.
Pittsburgh resident Ria Buford thought she found herself a new ride Saturday morning when she saw a man get out of the driver’s seat of an idling car in front of Club Xtaza, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports.
The man was in the middle of a phone call when Buford tried to seize the opportunity and made the dimwitted move to steal the vehicle.
The 32-year-old was surprised to find Officer Garrett Spory and another cop sitting inside the parked car, staking out a nearby afterparty following a Wiz Khalifa concert.
Spory quickly tried to push the woman out of the car.
Pittsburgh police, get out of the vehicle now!
Trying to think of the best excuse she could, Buford told the officers she was only taking the unmarked cop car to drive to her own vehicle, the Post Gazette reports.
We were both terrified that she was going to attempt to drive away with both of us in the vehicle,” Spory said in his complaint.
When Buford refused to get out, Spory made his way to the driver’s side and tried to yank the idiotic car thief from the seat.
That’s when an unidentified man came to her aid, grabbing the officer by his shirt.
Officers eventually arrested both him and Buford.
She was charged with robbery of a motor vehicle and disorderly conduct, while the man was charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, according to the Post-Gazette.

SAN DIEGO  CNS CBS 8  - A 22-year-old woman who led officers on a chase from downtown San Diego to Oceanside in a stolen police cruiser is in custody Saturday on suspicion of multiple felony charges.
Friday on the 300 block of 17th Street in the East Village neighborhood.
At times, speeds reached 90 miles per hour.
The chase was led by a San Diego police cruiser driven by Flores, believed to be under the influence.
We got a report from one of our officers in the downtown area that their police car was missing.
We were able to locate that car going northbound I-5, just past Genesee,” San Diego police Lt.
Steven Shaw said.
Friday, and what followed was a massive chase with numerous units, even air support.
The suspect continued north with no headlights on and that s when the CHP was called in.
The vehicle was spiked, two tires were deflated on the vehicle but the driver continued northbound on I-5.
Our air unit was also over head and kept an eye on the vehicle,” Lt.
Shaw said.
Driving on just the car s rims, Flores finally pulled into a Oceanside rest stop.
While in the rest stop it appeared the driver was trying to find their way out of the rest stop.
While the driver was doing that she intentionally rammed three police vehicles, two CHP vehicles and one San Diego vehicle,” Lt.
Shaw said.
Police tried negotiating with Flores and when that didn t work, they shot out a window with a bean bag.
When they finally got her out, she gave officers the wrong name.
Lt.
Shaw said.
As for how the car was stolen -- that s still under investigation.
The vehicle was taken from the downtown Gaslamp area.
Lt.
Shaw said.
Saturday on suspicion of felony grand theft auto, evading police, three counts of assault with a deadly weapon that is not a firearm on a peace officer, and other felony and misdemeanor charges, according to information from the San Diego County Sheriff s Department website.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.
The man has been identified as Joshua W.
Boyd from Liberty.
He is approximately 5’10”, 170 lbs, has facial hair, a goatee, and was last seen wearing a blue t-shirt, khaki shorts and black shoes.
Although police are not confirming they are the same person, FOX 4 has learned there is a Joshua William Boyd in the legal system, also born April 1984, who is listed as a non-compliant sex offender.
Joshua William Boyd was convicted in 2009 of two counts of attempted unlawful sexual acts with a child who was 14-years-old.
Police received a call around 2:30 Wednesday morning regarding a disturbance with a mentally ill man at the Shell Station near 37th and Main in Kansas City.
Two officers in separate patrol cars responded to the scene.
The picture on the far left from the Jackson County sex crimes website is a Joshua William Boyd from Nov.
2012.
The middle pic is from May 2013.
The last picture is the man, also named Joshua Boyd, who police say stole a police car and a shotgun.
They continued to look for him on Wednesday, Aug.
27.
According to court documents officers made contact with Boyd once they arrived at the scene.
They said he told them he was schizophrenic, off his medication and was afraid people were after him.
One of the officers called an ambulance for Boyd, but upon arrival, police said Boyd claimed the ambulance wasn’t real, then jumped into the driver side of one of the patrol cars, a Ford Taurus, No.
542.
One of the officers attempted to stop him by holding the car in park and removing the keys from the ignition, but Boyd was able to get the vehicle into drive.
After being dragged a short distance, the officer exited the vehicle through the window, attempting to avoid injury.
The second officer chased the suspect, but lost him due to high speeds, which reached over 100 mph, in the downtown area.
For about two hours, police talked to the man over the two-way radio and tried to negotiate with him to surrender.
When they lost communication with the two-way radio, police tracked the phone and car to the area they ended up searching Wednesday evening.
The police car was located at the 75 mile marker near I-35, about ten miles south of Bethany, Mo.
Inside the vehicle, police said they located a wallet with a jail wristband of Joshua W.
Boyd inside.
Police remained in that area, searching for Boyd .
We’re not asking people to stay inside and lock their doors.
What we’re asking is just for people to be aware of their surroundings, remove keys from their vehicles, if they’re going to be away from their residence, to lock their residence.
We don’t want, if the suspect is still in the area on foot, we don’t want him to have an easy opportunity,” said Sgt.
Angle with the Missouri Highway Patrol.
Authorities say they are knocking on doors, talking to residents and searching out-buildings.
Mainly we just want to encourage the public if they see anything suspicious, anyone suspicious, contact 911,” he said.
An employee of the Shell Station, where the chase began, was able to positively identify Boyd as the man who allegedly stole the police cruiser, from a lineup of six white males.
Court documents state that Boyd’s father, Joel Boyd, said his son had contacted him to tell him he was upset the police car he was driving could’t go faster than 130 mph.
Joel Boyd said the phone call disconnected, but his son immediately called back and told him he was driving a police car with a police issued shotgun in his lap.
He allegedly began telling his father that he loved him and his siblings and that he was going to visit his mother and grandmother, who are both deceased.
Late Wednesday, charges of 2nd degree robbery and resisting arrest were filed against Boyd in Jackson County.

Ford has already claimed that the police verson of the Explorer SUV has become America s new most popular cop car.
Now it says it has the numbers to prove it.
Ford sold 14,086 Interceptor SUVs last year, as the police version of the Explorer is known, up 140% from the year before.
At the same time, it sold 10,897 Taurus outfitted for police work, up 31% from 2012.
L.
Polk.
The industry as a whole was up 22% last year.
Taurus competes in the police sedan market against Dodge Charger and Chevrolet  Caprice.
General Motors announced a new Chevrolet SUV in February that will go up against the Explorer.
All are trying to fill the gap left by Ford s decision to kill the venerable Crown Victoria sedan, the mainstay of America s police agencies for years.
The new utility vehicle body is suited to the changing role of police officers, who need to carry more equipment to be ready for any contingency.
Some 90% of the Interceptors being sold now come with standard all-wheel drive.
More choices of turbocharged engines are being offered.
Honeycutt in a statement.
There is lots of information on engines for 1967-72 and 1976 squads, and a fleet-car forum .
How good were the Mopar police cars?
Bill Cawthon noted that Dodge squads held a grip on the California Highway Patrol longer than any other brand of vehicle.
The 1969 Polara was the fastest police car ever tested by the CHP, until beaten by the Camaro in the 1990s, 25 years later.
By 1958, Dodge was the sole source.
From 1958 until the 1980s, the only times a brand other than Dodge was selected as the primary car were in 1962, when the CHP bought Chrysler Enforcers; 1967, with Oldsmobile; and 1970, with Mercury.

If you’re a fan of supercars, you know Dubai is one of the world’s hottest places to spot them in the wild.
But the police have met this arms race with their own supercars, making it the world’s fastest road-going police force.
Dubai’s variety and quantity dwarf any other police force’s array of hot hoon-harvesting hardware.
Perhaps that s why the country tried to get everyone on board with banning poor people from the streets --not only are they additional traffic, they re just too darned slow.

New Iberia, Louisiana, he called the local sheriff’s station to figure out where his boy was.
I asked them if he’d been apprehended, and they told me no,” he said to me.
It wasn’t until the following morning, March 3, that Victor Sr.
Victor White III, had been arrested and died while in police custody.
But he didn’t receive the news from the New Iberia Sheriff s Department—he got the call from his son Leonard, who also lives in New Iberia and had been questioned that morning by police in connection with the death of his brother.
Immediately, of course, Victor Sr.
Alexandria down to New Iberia to find out what the hell was going on.
But the cops refused to tell him anything about the circumstances surrounding his 22-year-old son’s death, citing an ongoing investigation by the state police.
At that point, Victor Sr.
Every official he talked to was cagey.
They wouldn’t even let me see the body,” Victor Sr.
Eventually, when they realized he wouldn’t take “no comment” for an answer, they brought in the coroner and allowed Victor Sr.
They told me I couldn’t see his lower body,” he told me.
Still completely in the dark about what had taken place, Victor drove back home in utter shock.
Even then, the official version of events opened up even more questions than answers.
Here’s what is known at this point: On Sunday, March 2, Victor White III walked down to a convenience store with a friend to pick up a cigar.
When he got there, a fight broke out—it s unclear if Victor and his friend were involved, but in any case the cops arrived on the scene shortly after the fight ended, stopped Victor a couple blocks from the store, and discovered that he had some unidentified narcotics on him.
They cuffed his hands behind his back and put him in the back of their cruiser—and that s where the story stops making much sense.
They say he pulled out a handgun, while his hands were cuffed behind his back, and shot himself in the back.
I called the state police and the local sheriff s office to ask questions about whether Victor s last moments were caught on video, who the officers in question are, and how a suspect in police custody could have had a gun after being frisked, but no one would comment anything of substance since the shooting was being investigated.
Lieutenant Anthony Green, however, was willing to give his take on New Iberia s response to the shooting, stating, “The community is not really up in arms about this.
This isn’t the first time the Iberia Sheriff s Department has been suspected of brutalizing the people of New Iberia.
Last year, a group of officers were caught on video beating a handcuffed man at the town s annual Sugar Cane Festival, an incident that led to a deputy’s firing .
And at least a few activists are upset by this history of mistreatment.
On March 11, Reverend Raymond Brown, a fast-talking New Orleans preacher, hosted a small rally in New Iberia and called for the US Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Victor s death.
We believe they murdered him,  he told me over the phone.  They shot him in the back and then drove him to the sheriff’s office.
We don t buy the police’s story.
To those close to Victor III, the claim that he would try pull out a gun and shoot himself while in the custody of police is just absurd.
He was a respectable person.
He went to church.
And for them to say he shot himself, that’s just unbelievable,” said Victor Sr.
I saw his face.
According to his father, Victor III s previous run-ins with the law were minor—the kind you d expect of any young man: He was caught once with pot, he got a traffic violation for making a U-turn a while back, and when he was 16 he broke someone s window.
Local police officials, however, would not elaborate for me on Victor White III’s criminal record, once again citing the ongoing investigation.
But Victor Sr.
Victor III was getting his life on track: He’d moved down to New Iberia in November to be with his girlfriend and his six-month-old daughter and was living out of a hotel called the Cajun Inn with one of his brothers, his girlfriend, and his baby.
He’d taken a job at the local Waffle House, but his long-term plan was to go to vocational school for welding.
The day Victor III died, he told his dad over the phone that he was planning on using his $800 income tax refund, which he was carrying around that night in cash, to get a permanent home for his girl and his baby.
Outraged and dissatisfied, Victor Sr.
Victor White III.
They’ve hired attorney Carol Powell Lexing, who gained statewide recognition for her work on the Jena Six case.
Severely skeptical of the state investigation and the local police, Victor Sr.
White family have also created a campaign to raise funds for an independent autopsy and crime-scene tests.
Simply put, they re tired of waiting to hear from the police.
My family has no closure, because there are all these questions still looming over us,  Victor Sr. said to me in a moment of reflection and lamentation.  I m just in disbelief.
I still call out his name.

Cobb County police arrested a woman after they say she stole one of their police cars and led officers on a chase down Interstate 75.
At some point during the stop, the woman, identified as Emmerli Wilcoxson, managed to get into the police car and take off.
We saw two police cars coming.
They were going at a high rate of speed.
We tried to get out of the way,  said William Michael Jones, who witnessed the crash.  I told my wife they re gonna wreck.
Police say Wilcoxson was driving the car at speeds of more than 100 mph southbound on the interstate.
Calli Jones.
As Wilcoxson approached the North Avenue exit of I-75 85 southbound, police say she ran the car into the back of a Chevy Cavalier, sending them both into the wall.
Police say the Cavalier then hit another vehicle.
In total, four cars were involved in the crash.
Police say the driver of the Cavalier, Greg Titus, suffered severe injuries to his lower body and had to be extracted from the car.
Police say Wilcoxson got out of her car after the crash and charged at officers before she was subdued.
When we first came up to it we saw someone on the ground and they had their hands behind their back.
Calli Jones.
Police say Wilcoxson suffered severe head trauma in the crash and was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital.
A Cobb County officer suffered minor injuries and was treated and released from the hospital.
Several lanes of I-75 85 southbound were closed as police investigated the incident.
The lanes have since reopened.

In the wee hours of the morning on March 2, 22-year-old  Victor White III was shot while in the custody of Louisiana s New Iberia Sheriff s  department and was pronounced dead later that day at a local hospital.
The case has been of particular interest to me for the past few months because of who the law enforcement officials fingered as the triggerman.
According to initial information offered by Trooper Stephen Hammons to the press back in March, Victor III was stopped under the suspicion that he was involved in a fight at a convenience store near his home.
Hammons claimed the unnamed deputy involved searched White III, found unidentified narcotics on his person, and arrested him.
When they arrived at Iberia Parish Sherrif s Office, they said Victor III refused to exit the cruiser and became  uncooperative.  That s when he allegedly  produced  a handgun and fired off one round into his back, killing himself.
Other than those basic details, it s been radio silence for months in terms of official information from the local authorities, who ve cited an ongoing investigation into the shooting by the state police as their reason for not sharing any more details or answering any questions about Victor White III.
I know—I ve reached out to everyone from the local to state police, not to mention political officials like New Iberia s Mayor Hilda Curry, only to fall on deaf ears or get the line about an on-going investigation.
However, late last week some new information eked out via the Iberia Parish Coroner s Office.
Victor III s autopsy was performed the day he died by local forensic pathologist Christopher Tape, who has yet to return my calls for comment.
The report itself offers fresh insight into what happened that night, while fueling the only natural suspicion that we still don t know the full story of this incredible backseat shooting.
First off, the cause of death according to the report was a suicide, which is drastically different from the seemingly accidental shooting initially described by police officials.
According to Victor III s family, he had no history of mental illness or depression.
Despite initial statements made by authorities that said Victor III was shot in the back, the report describes no back wounds at all.
It was reported in initial local accounts of the shooting that Victor III was handcuffed behind his back.
So in order for him to have shot himself in the chest, he would have had to pull himself through his cuffed arms in the backseat of that cop car—and of course, have a gun in the first place.
I spoke again with Victor Sr.
The man was in a state of bewilderment and exhaustion, because after more than six months, he still has no idea what happened to his son and the explanations just don t add up.
Authorities have kept Victor Sr.
He was never alerted by officials that his son had been arrested and died in police custody in the first place.
Instead, he found out from his son Leonard, who had been questioned in connection with Victor III s death.
When Victor Sr.
New Iberia, at first the police refused to even let him see his son s body.
Then, when they allowed him see his son, it was only from the neck up.
The police wouldn t even reveal to him how they thought that his son died.
He ended up finding out that the police were claiming his son shot himself in the back by way of a public Facebook post published by the department.
Now, he s got the skeleton of an autopsy report that begs more questions than it provides answers.
Did Victor III actually have gun residue on his hands?
What kind of gun fired the shot and what kind of bullet was used?
Based upon what new information did this shooting suddenly become a confirmed suicide?
And how do the police reconcile this report with their initial account?
All of these are ringing in his head with all the old, unanswered questions, like who were the officers involved?
Is there a weapon or a bullet?
So much has happened across this country since I first reported on Victor White III s shooting in March: An unarmed, asthmatic father named Eric Garner was  strangled to death  by the NYPD in Staten Island.
An unarmed teenager named Michael Brown was shot six times—once in the head—and  killed by his local police  in Ferguson, Missouri.
And an unarmed, mentally ill 25-year-old named Ezell Ford was  shot three times  in the back and killed by two LAPD officers.
Righteous anger and frustration at these all too familiar occurrences have lead to protests and demonstrations across the country.
However, little national attention has been paid to the curious case of Victor White III.
The lack of credible information as to what actually went down surely has something to do with it.
And as time goes on, there is the very real possibility that his death will drop out of the news cycle.
UPDATE: We posted this link in our first story about Victor White III, but we wanted to remind readers again that the White family has created a  campaign to raise funds  for an independent autopsy and crime-scene tests.

A Louisiana community is asking questions nearly a month after police said that a young man fatally shot himself in the back in the back of a patrol car.
As the state police continue their investigation, though, the man s family is anxious for an answer.
Victor White III, 22, was apprehended by police in Iberia Parish   on the night of Sunday March 2 because of their suspicion that he   was involved in a fight nearby.
Trooper Stephen Hammons told the Baton Rouge Advocate that deputies who   searched White claimed to find illegal drugs on his person, at   which point they handcuffed him and drove to the police station   for processing.
Exactly what happened next is unclear.
Harmons told local media   outlets that White was uncooperative when it came time to enter   the police car, was able to produce a weapon with his hands   cuffed behind his back, and fired a single shot into his own   back.
The young man was then taken by ambulance to a local   hospital and pronounced dead.
Weâ€™re investigating how he got the gun,â€� Harmons said   earlier this month.
Sheriff Louis Ackal called on state police to launch an   investigation into the matter, meaning the authorities are not   permitted to comment publicly until the investigation is   completed.
Victor White Sr.
Viceâ€™s Wilbert Cooper that, when he drove the   two hours from his home to New Iberia, it was difficult to find   an officer who would explain what had happened that Sunday night.
He said the authorities initially refused to let him see Victorâ€™s   body and, when he refused to leave without an answer, they had   conditions.
They told me I couldnâ€™t see his lower body.
I could only see   his face,â€� the elder White told Vice.
Community activists share Mr.
Whiteâ€™s skepticism.
Reverend   Raymond Brown, the president of National Action Now, announced   that his organization is planning a rally that aims to pressure   the authorities to put more light on the situation.
A date for   the demonstration has yet to be set.
We expect the state police to drag their investigation on   for about nine or 10 months â€“ until they think the outrage about   what happened to Victor White has died down â€“ and then come back   and pass the buck to another law enforcement agency or say they   havenâ€™t found any evidence of wrongdoing,â€� he told the Louisiana Weekly .
Vice reported that, while the police were mostly quiet regarding   the case, a Lieutenant Anthony Green would have disagreed with   the Reverendâ€™s assertion saying, â€œThe community is not really   up in arms about this.
Other civil rights groups have become involved, including the   Lafayette Branch of the NAACP, the NAACP Louisiana Conference,   and more.
She also said the group is raising money   to conduct a second autopsy after New Iberia completes its own   examination.

According to police, a bicyclist was hit at the intersection earlier in the morning.
The officer who responded to that call had his cruiser parked at the corner while taking the report.
While the officer was interviewing the driver and that bicyclist on the sidewalk, police got another call that a child was unresponsive in the area and not breathing.
That s when a 17th district officer, according to police, turned on her lights, came speeding down Spruce Street and collided with a pickup truck.
The impact spun her vehicle into the parked police cruiser at the corner of the intersection.
The 17th district officer, the driver of the pickup truck, and the bicyclist were all hospitalized.
We are told all the injuries are considered to be minor.
Jason Spangler was there when it all happened.
Right after the initial contact I ran out to see if she was OK.
And she was bawling.
I felt, you know, you feel bad for that.

Back in college, I was the house and risk manager for my fraternity.
As you can imagine, this was a stressful job, as I was forced to monitor not only the many idiotic whims of my brothers, but the potential impact those ideas had on our house.
My least-fond memory of those hazy years involved a brother who drove a retired police cruiser.
He desperately wanted to be a cop and took to driving his blacked-out, push-bar-equipped Ford Crown Victoria like Martin Riggs from Lethal Weapon.
While his typical days were spent terrorizing other motorists by suddenly appearing in their rearview mirrors, one day he decided to lead the campus police on a high-speed chase  as one does .
He got ahead of them, hid his car and ran into the fraternity house, breathlessly telling me he d been there the whole time.
Shockingly, neither he nor I were arrested that day  keep in mind, these were just campus police , but I ve since become a firm believer that unless you want to start a second life as a taxi driver, you should not buy a used police car.

NEW IBERIA, La.
Victor White III died in a Louisiana hospital, the victim of a gunshot that police said White fired after being frisked twice, handcuffed and placed in the back of a New Iberia police cruiser.
The case has drawn national scrutiny because the details of the alleged suicide are so curious.
White family attorney Carol Powell-Lexing says the investigation contains “an avalanche of discrepancies” and the finding that White committed suicide is preposterous.
Short of him being Houdini or David Copperfield, it’s not possible,” she said.
To those who knew White, his March death makes less sense.
Things were looking up for the 22-year-old.
He had a daughter, Arianna, now 1, and a girlfriend.
He was working to save money to put down a deposit on a new apartment for his family.
My son did not kill himself.
He had too much going on.
He was full of life.
He was working.
He was about to buy a vehicle.
He was about to move into an apartment.
How could he kill himself?
He had too much going on,” the Rev.
Victor White Sr.
If someone wanted something, he would give his last,” White Sr.
His family, which includes eight siblings, will miss that about him, but most of all they’ll miss White’s energy and sense of humor, his dad said.
He had the broadest smile and loved a good joke.
This past Christmas, he enjoyed being the butt of one when he stuffed a pillow under his shirt and dressed up as Santa Claus.
The whole family knew the young man in the ill-fitting red suit was Lil Vic, but he kept them in stitches, playing the part, ho-ho-hoing all along the way.
He would bring humor to cutting grass,” his father said, recalling how his son would volunteer to help him mow the six lots owned by the Baptist church where he’s a pastor.
The Louisiana State Police wrapped up their investigation into the shooting last week.
It was handed over Friday to District Attorney Phil Haney of the 16th Judicial Circuit, who said he will let a federal investigation run its course before making a decision.
This doesn’t sit well with White’s family, Powell-Lexing said: “If everything is on the up-and-up” with the state investigation, why would the family have to wait until the federal inquiry is complete?
The family is not happy.
I’m not happy.
It shouldn’t matter what the feds say if this is an independent  state  investigation,” she said.
White’s family has expressed skepticism regarding the state investigation, and high-profile civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown fame, recently joined the family’s legal team.
In a press conference last week, Crump said White’s death is reminiscent of 21-year-old Chavis Carter’s 2012 death in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Jesus Huerta’s 2013 death in Durham, North Carolina, both of whom allegedly shot themselves while handcuffed in police cars.
We have a terrible recent trend that is occurring across states lines … that finds these Houdini handcuff suicides while they’re in the custody of police that defies all logic, all common sense,” Crump said.
S.
Attorney Stephanie Finley said this month.
The investigation will “supplement rather than supplant” the state investigation, she said.
Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt.
Ackal was refraining from comment for the time being so as not to influence the investigation, Turner said.
We are definitely going to stay out of the investigation until it’s complete,” he said.
Capt.
Doug Cain, state police spokesman, granted an interview but declined to discuss specifics of the case until the district attorney makes them public.
White had the day off from his job at the Waffle House on March 2.
He and a friend, Isaiah Lewis, had just arrived at a gas station to buy cigarillos when a fight broke out in the parking lot.
Lewis could not be reached for an interview, but White family attorney Powell-Lexing said she has seen surveillance tape from the store and knows White and Lewis were not involved in the fight.
They left the Hop-In shortly after the quarrel began, she said.
About six blocks from the store, an Iberia Parish deputy responding to the fight saw White and Lewis walking and stopped them, according to a state police news release.
Upon responding to the area, deputies located White and discovered he was in possession of illegal narcotics.
White was taken into custody, handcuffed behind his back and transported to the Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office for processing,” the release said.
According to the service report from the sheriff’s office, Cpl.
Justin Ortis received no description of the men involved in the fight.
He was told only that they were black, “and one of the males mentioned having a gun,” the report said.
When he stopped White, the service report states, White consented to a pat-down, and Ortis found marijuana in his pocket.
After reading White his rights, he searched White more thoroughly and found “suspected powder cocaine and a packet of cigarillos.
White’s cooperation apparently dissipated en route to the station, according to the state police news release.
Once at the station, he refused to exit the patrol car.
As the deputy requested assistance from other deputies, White produced a handgun and fired one round, striking himself in the back,” the release states, adding that White was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
Though the news release issued by state police provides scant details of White’s arrest and subsequent death, White Sr.
Why did it seem to imply White was involved in the fight at the gas station?
And more importantly, why did it say White shot himself in the back when the coroner’s autopsy shows he was shot in the chest?
The initial report that White was shot in the back rather than the chest has gotten some unfair media coverage, Cain of the Louisiana State Police said.
The bullet entered the right side of White’s chest, perforating his lung and heart, before exiting near his left armpit, according to the autopsy report.
In the rush to release information on the shooting in the hours after the incident, Cain said, investigators were guilty of a lack of a specificity but never intended to mislead the public as to the nature of the wound.
It’s not indicative of the intensive investigation we’ve undertaken in the last three months,” he said.
We work diligently to gather the facts.
Yet that is just one question White Sr.
The report, which noted White had alcohol and marijuana in his system, contains other findings that Powell-Lexing said were notable: There were “abrasions” around White’s left eye, White reportedly said something to the effect of “he was gone” before being placed in the police car and there was no “stippling,” or unburned gunpowder, around the bullet wound.
Stippling, Powell-Lexing said, is a sort of trademark of point-blank gunshot wounds.
As for the claim that White’s words were proof he was suicidal, the attorney can find no other word but “ludicrous,” she said.
After the report was provided to the family last month, coroner Carl Ditch issued a news release to elaborate, saying his ruling of suicide was based on information that hadn’t yet been released to the public.
Leonard, who told him Victor was dead, White Sr.
Alexandria to New Iberia, where he was met with only mystery, he said.
The sheriff’s office referred him to state police.
State police referred him to the sheriff’s office.
He also had difficulty getting access to the body.
How, he wondered, did authorities identify the body without consulting the next of kin?
He was finally allowed to see his son, but with restrictions, he said.
They told me I would be able to see my son, but I would only be able to see him from the neck up,” he said.
Not able to see the bullet wound beneath the sheet, the first thing White Sr.
White’s left eye down to his cheek.
Ditch, the coroner, who replied that the case was under investigation, according to White Sr.
Police told him the same thing.
Upset, he drove the two hours back to Alexandria, he said.
Once there, he received calls from friends and family members stunned by a news release posted on the Louisiana State Police website.
White Sr.
He had badgered authorities all day, to no avail, and he gets home to find they issued a press release?
We’re the last to know,” he said.
They haven’t told me anything.
They haven’t even spoken to me.
Ditch said in his August news release he would not comment further on the case.
The whole experience has left White Sr.
Right now, we have no closure because of what they’re saying.
There’s no way we can get closure, and there’s no way the grief process can take shape,” the Baptist pastor said.

Australia, who has its own cool police cruiser in the Holden Commodore-based HSV GTS, has just received a brand-new toy in the form of a Porsche 911 Carrera.
Provided by the company’s Australian arm as part of a partnership with the New South Wales Police Force, the German sports car won’t be used for highway duties, as its performance numbers might indicate.
Instead, it will be used to raise awareness among younger drivers and as a show car during various events.
There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s a shame this gorgeous sports car won’t get some proper highway action.

The F15 Security Plus is designed to meet the VR6 protection level, meaning attacks from small arms fire like the AK-47, AR-15, and most hand guns will have no effect on the passenger’s health  well, save for panic or heart attacks .
Ballistic panels and glass aren’t the only modifications BMW has done to the F15.
The chassis has been strengthened while the electronic management systems and brakes have been upgraded to deal with the added weight.
4-liter V-8 making 445 horsepower and 480 pound feet of torque.
This isn’t BMW’s first in-house armored vehicle.
Currently BMW is producing the VR7-rated 7 Series rated to protect against more lethal threats like explosives and higher-powered rifles.
More details are slated for release once the vehicle debuts in Moscow.

The new police cruiser from Dodge gets all the updates the civilian Charger gets, but also comes with all the right stuff for nabbin’ perps.
Cops are very demanding of their cars; it’s their rolling office and has to be comfortable for an eight-hour shift, plus be ready for chasing suspects sideways down a back road or at 120 mph on the interstate.

We saw a lot of them earlier this year when it seemed that there was a new supercar -turned-police-car every week.
But it’s only now that we get to see them all together all while talking to the police officers who carry the privilege of driving these exotics on a daily basis.
Department of Transport and Rescue acting director Anas Al Matrooshi gave Vocativ a comprehensive tour of Dubai’s finest police cruisers.

Now don’t go thinking the local police force responsible for protecting the county of Somerset is about to embark on a series of high-speed pursuits, because this specific Atom has a different purpose.
According to Auto Express , the featherweight vehicle will help local police raise awareness among motorcycle riders about road safety through the Safer Rider campaign.
There’s no explanation as to why the Somerset Constabulary picked an Ariel Atom for the campaign, but we’re guessing it’s because the vehicle lacks a proper shell, bearing a closer resemblance to motorbikes.
It might also have something to do with the fact that Ariel will launch a motorcycle later this year.

Other than being completely awesome and looking like something prepared for a zombie apocalypse, the Unique Armored Personnel Carrier was specifically developed and created with the objective of protecting passengers in high-threat environments in any conditions.
Whether it’s in the pulsating heat of summer or the sub-zero conditions of winter, this bad-boy is ready to fulfill its duties.
But that’s only one part about this armored monstrosity that makes it such a unique armored carrier.
Wherever it finds itself in, the Unique Armored Personnel Carrier has the capability to provide the kind of reliability, mobility, and protection that transport vehicles like this are known for.

Well, in Nevada and plenty of other states, there is a lot of this happening, and the police are raking in the dough because of it.
But now, the citizens are fighting back.
Enter in Tan Nguyen, a man that claims he was on his way to a cousin’s house in California after winning $50,000 at a local casino and as he headed through Humboldt County, Nevada, Deputy Lee Dove pulled him over for doing — get this — 78 in a 75-mph zone.
Dove then searched Nguyen’s car and Nguyen opened a briefcase for the deputy, exposing the $50,000 he was carrying.
Nguyen claims he only signed the form under the threat that Dove would confiscate his car and leave him stranded if he hadn’t.
After that was all said and done, Dove warned Nguyen about speeding and left without citing him for anything, but kept the money.
This cash would have been used to purchase illegal drugs and now will benefit Humboldt County with training and equipment.
Both Nguyen and Smith have rightfully filed lawsuits, but Nevada seemingly protects itself from this by requiring the owner of the money to prove that it was obtained legally.
So essentially, they are guilty until they prove themselves innocent.
What makes this all a little fishier is the fact that the Police keep 100 percent of the proceeds from the forfeiture.
Don’t go thinking that this can only happen in Nevada either, as 25 states allow police to keep all the forfeited and seized money, and 37 states have a  guilty until you prove your innocence  stance on forfeitures.
I, for one, say this is completely insane.
Who would think that the men and women that are supposed to protect and serve are robbing people blind, and the laws back them up?
Check out the video after the jump to see some of the crazy things the police have bought with forfeited money.

Commenters — obviously folks from Dubai — also pointed out that the image that circulated the web was simply a suggestion to the Dubai Police force and not a claim that the model actually existed.
And to prove its realness, the Dubai Police released a video highlighting the model all done up in the signature green and white livery.

Here’s the ultimate battle of Police supercars worldwide.
Personally if I would be a cop I would prefer Germany.
19mph, the Brabus CLS Rocket is currently the world’s fastest legal sedan .
The Porsche 911 Carrera S has been extensively modified by TechArt for its role as a police car.

Lamborghini donated one of these beauties to the Italian Police back in 2004.
They probably liked it as they purchased another one a year later for around $166,000.
Top speed: 190mph.
Powered by a 5 liter V10 with 500hp.
Not quite a supercar, but I bet chases on the narrow streets of Rome are much more interesting since the Italian Police got this.
The Exige is a lightweight, high performance car that accelerates from 0 to 60 faster than typical V8 cars and yet only uses around 5 liters   100 km.
406hp and a V8 with Lamborghini doors.
Yet another Gallardo with a better paint job than the British version.
The nearly $200,000 car was loaned to the authorities by a local Lamborghini importer to use it as an “attention-getting device” to control traffic.

Very cool, but you forgot the Subaru Impreza WRX from the French Gendarmerie.
In my opinion, the only car that you would ever see a lot on the streets, if at all, would be Australia’s Holden VE Commodore.
I live in Queensland, Australia and i’ve seen quite a few of these cars on the road… they’re what we call “highway cars”….
I can’t believe it!
Your post about the TechArt Porsche is wrong.
U will never found a 5 litre V10 Engine in a Porsche 911.
911 will ever have a “6 Cyl Boxer engine”.
That Police Corvette is not a c5 it’s a c6, note the rims and the inset doorhandles.
Ahh C beat me to it, oh well, you can still not the doorhandles etc.
The UK spec Gallardo is very much wearing normal police uniform for this country.
The base colour is yellow on the Gallardo, and most police cars seem to have white, but the high-visibility blue and yellow checks are the norm these days.
You might notice that the real nastiness is only on the sides of the car, and this appears to be intentional, as all UK police cars  apart from that exige  only have the real bright reflective colours on the sides.
This is clearly so that you stand less of a chance of noticing the car behind you is a police car!
It rains in the UK on over 50% of the time, and that livery pattern is essentially invisible when the roads are wet as spray from the wheels obscures the sides of the car, when looking from the front.
Why do we, in the US, all look like idiots here?
Hummer for a fat police sargent?
Magnums for an entire police force?

NSW police used wrx’s to try and keep up with get away cars and other assorted baddies.
QLD police also have a few FPV Typhoons getting around.
IMHO.
Around here in San Antonio, Texas and surrounding areas they use cars they seize in drug raids and turn them into police vehicles.
Magnums, Expeditions, Mustangs, Corvettes are just a few they used, most of them are undermarked, they have the logo but you have to be really close to see it and by that time it is too late.
I saw this at a local festival called Wurstfest in New Braunfels, Texas last year and I just had to laugh at that.

Oh yes, we in the US look like idiots.
That’s why there are Chargers in Chile and Fords in Russia  they used Caprices’ before the Fords .
Magnum’s and Chargers are competively priced with the other police package cars on the market.
And they all DO corner and accelerate.
There are few foreign units that will stay with them and they are all much higher in cost and often modified to do the job.
US police cars are built by the factories to do the job and do it safely.
Plus they are tough enough to stay together while doing it.
Our police cars are some of the best in the world.
More than ever when cost is figured in.
Just like our police.
They want cars that they can be comfortable in………for 8 hours a day while protecting your sorry butt!
Anyone that is in a vehicle all day wants, and deserves, a certain level of comfort.
What would be worse than being pulled over by some incompetent cop that’s been in an uncomfortable car 7 hours into his her shift.
I’m certain he she would be real pleasant to deal with.

I drove around in one of those police units for ten years.
The bad guys usually had better cars and better weapons than we did.
I don’t think all those fancy do-dads would be necessary, or the highpowered 180 MPH super car.
Just a heavy duty high power, built up suspension, heavy duty tires and bullit proffing protected automobile for the officers would be sufficient.
5 point harness for each officer as seat belts with helmets required.
Weapons equal to or that surpass the bad guy.

Hi, Dunno where you get your quoted top speed figures from, I’m guessing from the manufacturer of the standard car s .
Unless the motor is seriously hotted up, generally the cop version will suffer at top end ‘coz’ of the disco on the roof  aero drag becomes a real problem at high speed .
A friend sold a couple of Volvo Turbos to his local traffic dept.

30, 2014 – About $300 worth of candy that North Vernon Police officers planned to hand out during trick or treat hours Friday was stolen from an unmarked North Vernon police car parked at Cracker Barrel in Seymour.
The candy had just been purchased Wednesday and North Vernon officers had stopped to eat lunch when the candy was taken.
With this much, you would think they would know it was going to a large event to benefit kids,” explained Lt.
Randall Marshall with North Vernon Police Department.
Wednesday.
About half of the total amount of candy in the vehicle was taken.
A police badge and ID, a fingerprint kit and a camouflage backpack were also taken from the vehicle.
No firearms were stolen.
It is unknown if any firearms were in the vehicle at the time.
The small town police department spent another $300 to replace the stolen candy.
This is what the community expects of us during the night to to get through all these years.
We have civic interest line items in the budget.
We are basically going to rob Peter to pay Paul.
It was really disappointing,” said Marshall.
A surveillance photo shows a dark colored SUV in the parking lot at the time of the burglary.
North Vernon police officers are warning people in the area about a potential police impersonator.
Someone could try to impersonate an officer.
I really hope that doesn’t happen.
Someone could get hurt.
Don’t be afraid to ask for an ID if you are approached by a plain clothes person that only presents a badge,” said Marshall.
After hearing about the stolen candy, one woman dropped off two bags to the North Vernon Police Department Thursday afternoon.

Forensic evidence shows Michael Brown’s blood on the gun, on the uniform and inside the car of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, law enforcement officials said, information they believe potentially corroborates the officer’s story that the unarmed 18-year-old tried to take his gun.
The evidence will make it harder for the Justice Department to prosecute Wilson on federal charges that he violated Brown’s civil rights, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
Such evidence would also make it difficult for a county grand jury to indict Wilson on state charges, such as murder or manslaughter, said county sources who also are prohibited from talking on the record about the pending case.
The St.
Louis County police, the FBI and a county grand jury are investigating the shooting.
The Justice Department is investigating Ferguson and St.
Louis County policing practices and whether they have violated the rights of residents.
Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson declined to comment.
Activists march in the streets in Missouri to protest police brutality two months after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.
Oct.
Ferguson.
Wilson, who is white, fatally shot Brown, an African American, on Aug.
9 in the majority-black St.
Louis suburb of Ferguson.
The three-minute encounter on a sunny Saturday afternoon has rocked the metro area, which remains on edge as it faces continued protests and waits for the grand jury to decide whether Wilson should face any charges in Brown’s death.
Officials who spoke to The Washington Post on Saturday said the forensic evidence supports Wilson’s account that a scuffle occurred at the police vehicle, that Wilson feared for his life and that Brown went for, or lunged for, his gun.
There were two shots fired in the vehicle, including one that hit Brown’s arm, an official said.
Wilson, who has not spoken publicly since the shooting, testified before the grand jury last month.
His lawyer, James P.
Saturday.
Benjamin L.
Crump, a lawyer for Brown’s family, also could not be reached for comment.
He told the Times, however, that Wilson’s word isn’t “gospel,” and that he should be indicted and go to trial.
The officer’s going to say whatever he’s going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid,” Crump told the Times.
Right now, they have this secret proceeding where nobody knows what’s happening and nobody knows what’s going on.
It has never been in question that there was an altercation.
Wilson was inside the vehicle, and Brown was at the driver’s window.
From the earliest days police have said that Brown scuffled with Wilson and that a shot was fired in the vehicle.
In those first police accounts, St.
Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that Brown “allegedly pushed” Wilson back into the car after Wilson tried to open the door.
Brown, police said, then “physically assaulted” Wilson and went for the gun.
Wilson fired inside the vehicle, they said.
Wilson then got out and killed Brown, Belmar said.
Police said Wilson feared for his life because Brown charged him on the sidewalk.
Dorian Johnson, the 22-year-old who was with Brown when they encountered Wilson, gave another version of events: Wilson encountered them in the street and ordered them onto the sidewalk.
Wilson drove past, then backed up and opened the car door so forcefully that it bounced against the two men.
Wilson, still in the car, then grabbed Brown by his collar.
Brown was trying to free himself and never tried to get the gun.
Wilson drew his gun and threatened to shoot, then it went off.
Johnson and Brown then ran.
Several other witnesses recounted activity at the car, but each said they were unclear about the nature of that encounter.
They have offered varied though fundamentally similar versions of what happened afterward.
Brown, witnesses said, was fleeing when Wilson opened fire on the street.
After being hit by a bullet, Brown turned around with his hands up, trying to surrender, when the officer shot him several more times, they said.
Exactly how high Brown’s hands were has been inconsistent in the accounts, and at least one witness said that after Brown was shot, he appeared to take a step toward Wilson.
That witness said, however, Brown had his arms around his stomach before hitting the ground.
Brown was shot at least six times, according to three autopsies.
On Saturday, law enforcement officials declined to discuss what happened outside Wilson’s vehicle.
St.
Louis-area authorities declined to comment Saturday.
Protests were explosive after the shooting, when demonstrators squared off against police who used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse crowds.
Images of police patrolling the streets during the day and clashing with demonstrators at night shocked many and drew concern from the White House and some Washington lawmakers.
Some protest organizers said they were unmoved by the forensic details, noting there was no explanation provided of why Wilson continued to fire at Brown, who witnesses said was fleeing.
It  make us more convinced that there’s not going to be an indictment,” said activist Deray McKesson.
A grand jury decision is expected sometime in November, according to the St.
Louis County prosecutor’s office.

Abandon your dreams of setting a land speed record on the second longest straightaway in the world , Porsche has just bestowed Australian police in New South Wales with a 911 Carrera.
Thing looks straight out of a Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit game.
Or my dream journal.
Aussie cops  fun fact: colloquially called   Mr. Plod    have had a relationship with Porsche since 2012, and have used their vehicles at some  300 public relations events  over the last two-plus years.
This 911 might strike fear into the heart s of would-be speeders, but its duties will be restricted to parading and posing.
Police Superintendent Sicard, undoubtedly disappointed he won t get a chance to open it up on the Eyre Highway or the gut-twisting curves of the Blue Mountains.
Porsche is maintaining ownership of the car; the cops are just allowed to dress it up and drive it around as long as they keep it out of harm s way.
The design is the result of a contestâ€“ students from local and international high schools all submitted ideas, this striking deep-blue-and-white won out.

SkyForce10 was over the scene of a multi-vehicle crash in Center City involving two police cars.
Two people were injured and taken to the hospital.
A chain-reaction crash in Center City Philadelphia involved two police cruisers and left one officer hurt.
Philadelphia Police.
The cruiser then slammed into an unoccupied police cruiser, said investigators.
The crash left three people hospitalized with what police described as minor injuries -- at least one of those injured is an officer who complained of pain after suffering some scrapes, said investigators.
As SkyForce10 hovered overhead a short time later you could see the two police cars -- one sandwiched between the other and pickup truck.
You could also see officers investigating the scene.

This week is the 50th anniversary of the events that became known as the Free Speech Movement on the Berkeley campus.
I was there; I can testify.
It was quite the most exhilarating thing in my college career.
Not, technically, that I was a student at UC anymore — we had parted by mutual agreement the year before.
That is, they agreed not to invite me back and I agreed not to come.
I did spend a lot of time at the Pelican, the campus humor magazine.
I wasn’t supposed to be writing for it, being a nonstudent and all, but I was anyway.
I was, if memory serves, between jobs.
I was just a campus layabout, basically, writing silly stuff when the spirit moved me.
So I was walking through campus one day, and there were a bunch of people sitting around a police car.
It all looked jolly.
I sat down and asked why we were all sitting down.
Turned out the guy in the police car had been arrested for refusing to show his ID when they asked him to stop passing out literature at the CORE  Congress of Racial Equality  table.
Political activity had been banned from Sproul Plaza, which was the campus agora.
Clearly an assault on free speech.
Plus, it was a university acting as censor, a violation of everything an institution of higher learning is supposed to find sacred.
It was sort of a no-brainer which side to be on.
Before FSM, I had spent time marching for nuclear disarmament.
I had slept on the steps of Sproul Hall on behalf of peace.
I had joined Slate, which was a lefty campus political organization.
So I wasn’t exactly unprepared.
On the other hand, this protest had been entirely spontaneous.
There seemed to be no leaders; the only example of leadership I heard about was when some guy said, “Sit down” and the people around the car did.
Of course, there were people who had prepared for this moment, people who saw some sort of clash as inevitable.
They were prepared for something; the police car was an opportunity.
So nice when Authority hands you a stick to beat it with.
And then the speeches.
Who were these people, the ones standing on the police car and talking?
They were the people who got to make the speeches.
But the rhetoric, or at least some of the rhetoric, was effective.
We believed we were adding our voices to a nationwide upheaval; we were supporting our brothers and sisters in wherever.
And we were, of course; we were not delusional.
The FSM was a big deal; it inspired many other student movements.
And student movements were a good thing; they blew a lot of soot out of the pipes.
They made people confront larger truths.
And then Mario Savio spoke.
Ah.
I said to myself, here’s the leader.
The offhand eloquence, the clarity of vision, the gentleness of his manner — he was charismatic.
It was the first and last time I ever saw charisma developing right before my eyes.
Suddenly we knew we could outlast the police cars.
We stayed and stayed; they stayed and stayed.
Jack Weinberg remained in the police car, every so often peeing into a cup.
The rest of us had options in that regard, as long as we didn’t leave all at once.
It was a big crowd.
I remember, finally, the battalion of police cars brought up to the Bancroft entrance, all shining their lights on us.
It seemed as though they were planning to mow us down.
Ah, but wait!
Negotiations had been successful.
The charges against Weinberg were dropped.
Other concessions had been made by the university.
Hooray!
We could all go home.
So we all did.
I recall it as a joyous time.
I recall talking to just anyone I met, all of us smiling, all of us not quite understanding just what had happened.
But of course the compromises were not sufficient.
The student movement kept rolling.
There were daily meetings on Sproul Plaza.
The faculty came around to our side, but the administration — never.
Which is what made the protest in Sproul Hall inevitable.
I had a date that night.
Honest, I didn’t know it was the day on which we were going to stand up and be counted — literally.
That’s what being arrested in a sit-in is like: Stand up, get counted.
Not everyone agreed to stand up.
They were even more dedicated; getting dragged down steps is no fun at all.
I admired everyone who was there and willing to get arrested to bring attention to a cause.
I was not cynical about any of it; it may be the last time that cynicism did not play some role in my thinking.
The FSM continues; I get bulletins.
It’s still doing joyful work for good things.
That’s not a bad legacy.

6 million Bugatti Veyron.
The Bugatti is the latest addition to the Dubai police force’s “super fleet” of luxury and high-end sports cars, according to global news site Vocativ .
5 seconds.
But if you’re hoping to see how it performs in a police chase, don’t get your hopes up.
The car is just the latest weapon in a Dubai police public relations campaign.
Dubai police are using their impressive fleet as a means of building connections between citizens and tourists.
Described by Vocativ as one of the most progressive Arab police forces, officers like to show off their fancy wheels in some of the most luxurious parts of Dubai, including shopping malls, the beach, and luxurious hotels.
The move appears to be working and the cars are definitely getting star treatment on Instagram and Twitter.
Vocative watched the cars “set off a firestorm of activity” on social media as they were driven through the streets of Dubai.
In a video interview, second lieutenant Khalifa Abdulla Mohammed Alfalasi said the fleet has become another one of Dubai’s tourist attractions.
Usually people when they see a policeman, they feel scared.
But in this car, you feel different.
In addition to the Veyron, Dubai police also have in their fleet an Aston Martin 177, an Audi R8, a Nissan GTR, a Ferrari FF, and a Ford Mustang.

Meanwhile, a police force across the pond is getting a major tune-up.

ABS, an advanced electronic braking system, helps prevent a braking skid.
This electronic stability control system helps reduce the risk of rollover crashes by keeping the vehicle in the driver s intended path by applying throttle, braking, or a combination of both.
Traction control limits wheel spin by reducing engine power to the wheels  engine speed management  and by applying brakes to each individual wheel  brake-traction control  as necessary.
Designed to assist the driver in stopping or decreasing vehicle speed in emergency driving conditions, the brake assist feature uses the stability system hydraulic brake control module to supplement the power brake system.
This module increases brake pressure at each corner of the vehicle until the Antilock Brake System  ABS  activates.
Safety belt pretensioners can help tighten the safety belts for front outboard occupants during the early stages of a moderate to severe frontal, near-frontal or rear crash if the threshold conditions for pretensioner activation are met.
With side curtain airbags, safety belt pretensioners can help tighten the safety belts in a side crash or a rollover event.
The Caprice PPV had the shortest stopping distance of any vehicle tested during the 2013 Michigan State Police Vehicle Evaluation.
The Caprice PPV is offered with a Limited Slip Rear Axle that can give more traction on snow, mud, ice, sand or gravel.
It works like a standard axle most of the time, but when traction is low, this feature will allow the rear wheel with the most traction to move the vehicle.
V8 standard, optional on V6.
The Caprice PPV s body structure is designed to maximize energy absorption during a crash and minimize potential intrusion into the passenger safety cell, which is strategically reinforced with steel up to seven times stronger than normal.
In severe frontal impacts, the steering column may collapse and, to help to reduce leg injury, the brake pedal attachment may release.
The Impala provides the outstanding safety performance expected of a family sedan.
The Impala is also the only large sedan that includes OnStar®, which can automatically send emergency help to a crash.
Not only does the Impala have standard anti-lock brakes, but it also includes Electronic Brake Force Distribution, which helps provide optimum braking regardless of load, traction or braking speed.
The Impala can provide a protective  safety cage  around occupants.
The 2012 Tahoe SUV RWD achieved an overall rating of four out of five stars in the Federal government s top frontal crash test ratings.
The Tahoe PPV is equipped with the Hill Start Assist feature, which may be useful when the vehicle is stopped on a grade.
This feature is designed to prevent the vehicle from rolling, either forward or rearward, during vehicle drive off.
The Tahoe PPV is offered with an optional Locking Rear Axle that can give more traction on snow, mud, ice, sand or gravel.
It works like a standard axle most of the time, but when traction is low, this feature will allow the rear wheel with the most traction to move the vehicle.
The 2012 Tahoe received the highest Ergonomics and Communication total rating for all vehicles tested by the Michigan State Police Evaluation team.

MANHATTAN — Call it a case of NYPD poo.
The scatological crime scene was discovered earlier this week when Community Affairs officers went to their cars outside an NYPD outpost at 34 1 2 E.
University Place, and were met with the disgusting mess.
Police officials suspect that the excrement may be the handiwork of a few young homeless people who had been camping out overnight beneath scaffolding outside the building.
Community Affairs officers recently shooed them away and they may have left their mark in protest, a source said.
The source added, however, that there might be another culprit.
The source explained that there has been some criticism from residents that Community Affairs officials take up too many parking spots on the street, painting lines for their vehicles and often placing wooden barricades in spaces to keep others from using them.
It could be a local person,” the sources said.
Regardless, the patrol cars were driven to a local car wash where the evidence was washed away, the source said.
Sources say no arrests or summonses are expected.

You are now in the know!
A coroner’s report obtained exclusively by NBC News claims that a 22-year-old Black man committed suicide while handcuffed behind his back in the back seat of a police car on March 3.
Yet, according to an initial statement from the Louisiana State Police, Victor White III had shot himself in the back.
The report also revealed that the bullet struck White’s right chest and exited under his left armpit, leading to another contradiction: White’s family members have said that he was left-handed.
In addition to his wound, abrasions were also reportedly discovered on his face that were not there when police first stopped him.
NBC News reported .
White’s hands were never checked for gunpowder residue.
Dr.
Carl Ditch declared White’s death a suicide and reportedly confirmed in a recent press release that it was possible for White to shoot himself in the chest based on his “body habits,” or rather his physique or build.
You can’t make me understand,” Rev.
Victor White II, 53, a Baptist minister and former substance abuse counselor, told NBC News.
You can’t make me understand how my son took his left hand, when he was handcuffed behind the back, and shot himself.
On the evening of his death, March 3, White had been hanging out with friends in the town of New Iberia before he and a new friend, Isaiah Lewis, left to go purchase a small amount of marijuana.
After purchasing $10 worth, the young men bought cigars from a nearby gas station.
A fight that occurred between two men outside of the gas station prompted someone to call 911, but White and Lewis left once the men ran away.
The police stopped both White and Lewis on their way back from the station, patted them down and located “suspected marijuana” in his pants, according to the report.
The police then ran White and Lewis’ names through a police database and called for backup.
Another search yielded a small amount of cocaine.
White had been handcuffed behind his back and put in the back seat of the cruiser by the time a second police car arrived.
Lewis, who was dismissed, walked back to his father’s house, but White was transported to the Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office where he “became uncooperative” “produced a handgun” and “fired one round, striking himself,” according to police.
Lewis did not know for certain whether White had a gun, but he says he never saw one.
I try playing it out in my head,” Lewis told NBC News.
Dash camera footage and the names of the officers present during White’s death have not been released by the State Police yet due to the pending investigation.
Meanwhile, the White family told NBC News that they doubt the investigators will contradict the coroner’s ruling and have not decided whether to file a lawsuit.
I don’t’ think anything is going to be different from what they already said,” said Rev.
White.
It’s difficult to see that anything else would bring us back what we need.

Police cars are emergency service vehicles used by police .
The cars begin to chase the protagonist of each Grand Theft Auto game when they have received either a police head or wanted star .
Police cars are known by different names in different games, whilst GTA IV has two models of police cars: The Police Cruiser and Police Patrol .
Since GTA III, the majority of police cars in the game have shared the same body design as the Taxi .
Other police and law enforcement vehicles exist.
These include the Enforcer police SWAT van, the Police Maverick helicopter, HPV-1000 and VCPD Wintergreen police bikes and the Predator police boat.
Oddly, the Vice City Stories Police Predator won t respond if your in a boat until you achieve a 4 star wanted level.
In Grand Theft Auto 1 , the police car is known as the  Squad Car .
Three variants of the car exist, each appearing in one of the game s three cities.
In Liberty City , the Squad Car is rounded vehicle with blue-white livery, appearing similar to a 1990 s Chevrolet Caprice; the San Andreas   Vice City variants are actually adaptations of the Portsmouth , with the San Andreas version bearing a black-and-white body color design and similar angular body design, and the Vice City rendition being colored blue and white but features a modified body that appears wider and rounded.
In the PC version of GTA 1, the police cars  along with the Ambulance and the Fire Truck   will have their radio tuned to Brooklyn Underground FM , unlike all other renditions throughout the series which only have the standard police dispatch radio.
The performance of GTA 1 Squad Cars are identical in all three cities, and are all essentially the best in the game, with the highest top speed and acceleration among all cars in the game, highly responsive brakes and good grip.
While the cars are given a very high export value of $2,000, but the cars cannot be exported, as are other emergency vehicles.
In Grand Theft Auto 2 , the police car is known as the  Cop Car  and assumes a completely original design, looking like a retro-futuristic squad car with 1940s design cues.
Like in GTA 1, it is the fastest car in the game, along with the Meteor , and features responsive cornering and brakes, making it a desirable vehicle to drive.
It is also the only car in the game which gives a Cop Bribe when crushed .
The police car in GTA2 was originally green-and-white, along with the SWAT Van , but this combination is never seen in the game, it was changed to a blue-and-white combination.
Ray Larabie  s original design for GTA 2 s  Cop Car .
A Vice City Squad Car with an officer beside it.
In all the games of this era, the police car has been known as the  Police , with the exception of GTA Advance and GTA Vice City Stories.
In GTA Advance, it is referred to as the  Police Car , and in GTA Vice City Stories, it is called the  VCPD Cruiser .
Throughout all 3D era games, police cars are very fast, with excellent handling, and moderate durability.
These stats make it great for drifting.
They have two sirens, one default  long-whirl , and the  rotating-weep , triggered by holding the horn button.
The player will receive 5 rounds of ammunition for any weapon in the Shotgun slot after entering a Police car.
The Police Car in these two games resembles a cross between a Chevrolet Caprice and a Ford Crown Victoria.
In GTA III , the Police Car was originally intended to have a blue-and-white stripes livery similar to the 1990s early 2000s NYPD police cars, however, in the final version, they have standard black and white livery like the Los Angeles Police Department.
Also, the original Police Car had a more sleek profile compared to the final which appears more angular boxy  though hints of the aerodynamic design do remain .
The Police Cars in GTA Liberty City Stories feature the stripes livery intended for GTA III cars, albeit in black-and-white rather than blue-and-white.
Early pre-release depiction of GTA III s police car, featuring a lower profile and the 1990s early 2000s NYPD color scheme.
In these two games, the vehicle resembles a 1980 s Ford LTD, and both feature a green and white livery, much like the Miami-Dade Police Department.
During development, the vehicle was white with red and blue stripes along each side, resembling squad cars from the Miami Beach Police Department.
Despite the differences in textures and paint, the vehicle polygon model is reused from GTA III.
In the PC version of GTA Vice City, a rare all-white variant can be found parked at random locations.
Despite the fact that the Police in Vice City has AWD, it lacks the stability of other fast AWD vehicles in the game  namely the Deluxo and Comet  .
As such, the Police is prone to roll over or spin at a moments notice, so it may be best to avoid drastic and abrupt maneuvers while driving it.
The same car was reused in Rockstar s Manhunt games.
They only appear as static objects, as driving is not an intended feature in Manhunt.
The main difference is that the car has a black and white paintjob instead of a green and white paintjob.
Early pre-release depiction of GTA Vice City s police car, featuring a livery more alike to that of the Miami Beach Police Department.
There are three variations in GTA San Andreas .
The Los Santos Police Department and San Fierro Police Department versions have the same build, based on the Premier , with the San Fierro version having slightly higher suspension most likely due to San Fierro s hilly streets with steep inclines  like its real life counterpart, San Francisco , and markings for their respective cities.
The Las Venturas Police Department version generally resembles a 1981-1990 Chevrolet Caprice, with the sides and back reminiscent of the 1980-1989 Dodge Diplomat, and the closest civilian car in the game is the Tahoma .
All police vehicles feature a standard black and white livery.
The police officers in the countryside employ a large, four-by-four Ranger , based on the Rancher , for pursuit on rough terrain.
Early design for the SFPD  Police  car which bears more of a resemblance to the Chevrolet Caprice than its final design.

A close up of the LSPD police car engine.
The GTA Advance rendition of the Police is designed to bear a likeness to the Police from GTA III, with a generally rounded profile and a black-white paintjob.
Unlike other renditions, the car is substantially more speedy, with a top speed matched with the Banshee  s.
Being a mid-sized car, crushing the Police will only award the player with a base amount of $532.
For much of the games which exist within the HD universe, police cars exist in the form of generations of the Ford Crown Victoria, paralleling the widespread popularity of the car among police forces across America.
Other variants of police cars exist, an example being the Merit -based Police Patrol in GTA IV  inspired by the NYPD s use of the Chevrolet Impala 9C1 Police Package  , and the Buffalo -based cruiser in TBoGT and GTA V  inspired by USA and Canada police force usage of the Dodge Charger Police Package  .
GTA V emulates the declining usage of the Crown Victoria as a general purpose cruiser, as the Ford Taurus Polic Package -based Interceptor takes that role within the LSPD.
Crown Victoria - based LSPD cruisers still exist, in the iconic LAPD paint scheme, but its use is to a lesser extent.
However, the Crown Victoria is adopted as a cruiser in the countryside.
The player can get in any police car and access the police computer while stationary.
Here, the player can access Most Wanted missions, or locate and apprehend nearby criminals.
The siren on both police cars features some variations, including the classic  code-3 siren  wail, the yelp when the siren is activated and the horn button held down, and, if the siren is turned off and the horn button held down, a distorted  crowd control  air horn, as used in real life.
One missing siren variation is the code-2 siren which is just lights but no siren, but this siren is possible in a rare glitch.
The air horn is the most common horn sound which is available for both police cars  and other emergency vehicles .
Officers in real life use it to pull over people and respond to domestic calls  but when cruising, police sometimes honk regular horn rather than air horn  In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas you can do it by rapidly turning it on and of until just the lights are on as if you where not in the police car with the lights on.
The lights without siren only occurs when exiting the vehicle with siren on, applying only when the player does it.
This code-2 siren glitch has been confirmed on GTA IV.
The player can dial 911 to summon the police car by luring them to a false alarm.
Stealing the car  while the officer searches for any incidents , will attract a one-star Wanted level .
In some places, a police car can be stolen from a parking lot or curbside without incurring a Wanted level.
Police cars in GTA Chinatown Wars are simply dubbed   Police Patrols  , the same name for those seen in GTA IV.
While having reverted to a panda body colour scheme, the car incorporates GTA IV s police computer for use in vigilante side missions.
Although the car is implied to be similar to GTA IV s Declasse-based Police Patrol, pre-rendered depictions of the Police Patrol and the Police Cruiser are used during   busted   sequences in the game.
Four types of police cars are seen in GTA V.
The first one is the Police Cruiser , based on the second-generation Vapid Stanier , along with a Sheriff variant .
The second is the Vapid Interceptor , which is also named Police Cruiser in game, which is the most common type of law enforcement vehicle used by the Los Santos Police Department.
The fourth is the Esperanto -based Police Roadcruiser , which cannot be obtained and is only seen in the Prologue .
Unlike previous games, they are numbered randomly, varying between 00-99.
These vehicles has two versions of lightbars: LED and older rotatating ones.
The North Yankton State Patrol Police Roadcruiser uses a second variant, an LED lightbar that flashes side-by-side only.
Sirens in GTA V are a considerable improvement over the previous games attempts at realistic siren equipment.
All police cars are equipped with four siren codes: wail, yelp and phaser respectively.
Air horns can be used also.
The Stanier - based cruiser s use within the LSPD is to a lesser extent, although versions with LED lightbars may be dispatched due to a rare glitch.
Police cars are usually parked in front of police stations and are often locked.
Like all other police cars, they can be found at every police station in Los Santos in Grand Theft Auto V .
Can be found on the side of highways monitoring speeds.
Seen chasing random cars throughout the state.
The feature of dialing 911 for a police car returns in GTA V , in the form of a contact on the player s in game phone.
In GTA IV , the LCPD cars are very alike and similar to the New York Sheriff Cars.
In GTA IV and GTA V, if the siren takes a hit it will begin to make many different high-pitched noises similar to its normal siren, but severely distorted.
Other cars won t pull over if you are driving a police car with a distorted siren.
LSPD Car, however the car has the rims of the Police car and Taxi in GTA Vice City.
In GTA III, if you look carefully on the front grille of Police Car, you can see a manufacturer badge, which resembles the one which real-life car company Ford uses.
If the player in San Andreas were to turn on the Ninja Theme cheat, the Police Car will still appear but the car is completely blacked out thus making it a unique paint scheme.
The player can keep it by simply stealing the car, turning the cheat off, and saving it in their safehouse s garage.
GTA III police cars arguably have the most realistic sirens compared to the other renditions in the 3D Universe .
In the GTA San Andreas, the police car in the parking lot of Las Venturas Police Headquarters is only location that the police car is alarmed.
However, the alarm sound is not heard, only the light is flashing, and if you drive near an officer on the street, you will attract one wanted star.
In GTA V, police cars that features rear window sirens are programmed to alternate each lights, however, if you look closely on the red one, there s a brief moment where both red lights were on, which is absent on the blue light.
The GTA III police car is equipped with a secondary light bar resembling a McDermott High Rise lightbar.
These are actually used by the NYPD s Highway Patrol division.
A fairly noticeable, yet commonly overlooked and unseen, glitch is present in the police cruiser in Liberty City Stories .
When you achieve a 3 Star Wanted level, the police cruiser exceeds its top speed, being able to catch up to a Cheetah with minimal effort.
This is likely only a bug, but it only makes it harder to outrun them.
It is more tactical to use a car that has good brakes, doesn t swerve, and hugs the road when this glitch occurs.

A 30-year-old handcuffed suspect escaped the back seat of a Cleveland police car, officers said.
Two patrolling officers were called to the neighborhood to assist a vice unit already responding to a report of gunfire in the area.
Officers on scene handed over the suspect when patrolmen arrived.
The officers left the car to help the vice unit pacify a nearby crowd.
When the patrolmen returned, the suspect was gone.
Someone may have opened the door for him, the officers said.
It is unclear if the suspect is still on the loose.

Throughout the years, one of the favorite sites of hacks has been the ``Great Dome,   the large classical dome that sits atop Building 10.
In May of 1994, inspired hackers created what might just become one of the most famous Dome hacks of all time, by placing what appeared to be a real MIT Campus Police cruiser on top of the dome, complete with flashing lights.
The car turned out to be the outer metal parts of a Chevrolet Cavalier attached to a multi-piece wooden frame, all carefully assembled on the roof over the course of one night.
The hackers paid special attention to detail.
Not only had the Chevy been painted to look just like a Campus Police car from all sides, but a dummy dressed up as a police officer sat within, with a toy disc gun and a box of donuts .
People first began noticing the hack early in the morning, just before sunrise, when passers by spotted the flashing lights on top of the building.
Local people, reporters, and camera crews began to gather around 8, smiling, talking, taking pictures, and just generally watching as MIT Physical Plant began the slow dismantling of the car.
Several helicopters even came to look, circling close around the Great Dome.
Not only did the local TV stations air footage of the car --- some of which later wound up on national news --- but the AP story  available on the Web to MIT people via Athena  spread to newspapers around the globe, from California to Korea and even Israel.
If the hack s goal was to amuse and entertain --- the purpose of the vast majority of hacks at MIT --- this hack was among MIT s most successful.
Here at MIT, students also seemed to appreciate the hack.
On Monday evening, a slide at the Lecture Series Committe  LSC  movie read ``MISSING: one white and blue patrol car.
The number is, of course, the local number for the MIT Campus Police.
As an interesting side note, though the television broadcasts reported a wailing police siren in addition to the lights, witnesses at the site insist that there was no such sound.

So, the price on here is a rip off.
We didn t pay close enough attention to the size listed on here and thought we were getting a larger car for our son.
When the package  envelope  came in I thought it was a Christmas ornament I had also ordered.
Instead it was this tiny police car.

A Cobb County police officer is injured after investigators said a woman, Emmerli Wilcoxson, drove off with one of their cruisers.
Police said they responded to Windy Hill Road in Cobb County where a 911 caller reported Wilcoxson standing in the street with a weapon.
Police tried using a stun gun on the woman but that didn t work.
She was able to break free, get into a police car and take off.
Officers chased Wilcoxson into Atlanta where the chase in some areas reached 100 mph.
Police say Wilcoxson was yelling at them over the police radio during the chase.
Carolyn Mitchell, a witness.
The incident ended in a four-vehicle crash.
Officers said Wilcoxson rear-ended a vehicle, which sent both cars into a wall.
Police worked to free one person from one of the vehicles involved.
According to police, after the crash Wilcoxson got out of the car and took a fighting stance against officers.

Yet somehow, police in Massachusetts realized that a Maserati isn’t likely to be a real cop car.
Because hello, $100,000  give or take a few thousand  sports car, you’ve clearly got better things to do than impersonating a police cruiser.
The Braintree, Mass.
Maserati that was “made to look like a police cruiser,” including a black-and-white paint job with a police-ish shield on the doors and the appropriate decals, reports the Patriot-Ledger .
And upon closer inspection, that shield actually read “Decepticons punish and enslave,” instead of “protect and serve.
Another telltale sign — the vehicle was missing the blue police lights on top.
A patrol officer found himself behind the Maserati and found it funny, because he “didn’t know of any  police  department that had a Maserati,” so he pulled the car over.
It’s unclear how that defense will hold up — he’s been summoned for a clerk magistrate hearing in district court.

What about cars that the police sell at auction?
Those still have the spot lights on them, even.
This is stupid unless the owner was actively attempting to fool people into thinking he was a cop.

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.
WAVY  — Authorities continue to search for a driver they say led state police on a wild chase before smashing into several vehicles at a shopping center and fleeing the scene on foot.
The Honda hit the Trooper’s vehicle then sped away.
Sgt.
Trooper never got out of his vehicle.
The Trooper began to chase the driver along Pacific Avenue and then down Shore Drive, but the driver got away.
Police said the Honda hit two other vehicles, a fence and a jet ski trailer.
WAVY News 10 obtained this surveillance video from Joe Johnson, a manager at Froggies Cantina By The Bay on Shore Drive.
It shows the moment the suspect crashed.
10 On Your Side’s Liz Palka talked to a witness who said she was leaving a consignment store when the suspect came over the curb and pummeled several parked cars.
She was just about to get into her white Toyota Camry.
When he hopped the curb, at first I thought, ‘OK.
He’s going to stop, he’s going to stop, he’s going to stop, ” Meredith Reid said.
After wrecking the vehicle, police said the man jumped out of the driver’s seat and fled.
The witness saw him take off toward the beach.
I was just panicking because I thought, ‘Oh my God, this person – they’re probably dead, ” Reid continued.
With the help of Virginia Beach Police K-9 units, state police searched for the suspect throughout the Ocean Park neighborhood.
The suspect showed up next door to Cameron Drude, who lives a mile away in Aeries on the Bay: “He was hiding back where the kids’ playground is next door.
He was there to stay out of site, and the cops were in the neighborhood.
Drude lives next door to Joleen Bakel, who said she saw the suspect running towards her.
She had come out of her home with her children because she heard the police helicopter above.
As we were standing on our deck watching the helicopter, there was a man who came running very fast towards my house,” Bakel said.
I didn’t think anything of it until he crossed over my lawn and ran down the middle of my lawn and my neighbor’s house.
Bakel’s husband saw the suspect crouched down by the swing set.
He went to call 911, but when he returned the man had taken off.
Joleen thinks he ran across the street, down a grassy area to a path in the back of home across the street.
It’s believed he ran along the back side, coming out along a path.
He then made his way to the beach, blended in, and escaped in the crowd.
I saw him running, he had no shirt on, he was wearing khaki cargo shorts, boxers hanging out of the shorts, he was carrying a shirt.
He was white, with brown hair, and that’s all I saw,” Bakel said.
10 On Your Side was told there was no reverse 911 call made to nearby residents because the suspect was not considered a risk to the community.
There was no immediate danger to the community,  said Lt.
Reo Hatfield, an executive aide to Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera.
Hatfield also said VBPD officers did not participate in the pursuit because it did not meet the department’s guidelines, which would include the suspect’s offense being a felony.
The suspect has not been found.
The man took off on foot after slamming into this car and others at a strip mall’s parking lot.
This parked car was hit by the suspect who fled from officers in Virginia Beach.
These two cars were hit by the suspect’s car as he drove away from the police.

ET: A handcuffed Houston-area high school student shot himself in the head Wednesday while in the back of a police car, officials said.
No one else was hurt.
The incident began when police were called to North Shore Senior High School in unincorporated Harris County to investigate a report of a student with a firearm, said Capt.
Jon Moore with the Harris County Constable Precinct 3.
The student was searched, handcuffed behind his back and placed in the back of a patrol car but apparently still had a gun, Moore said.
The student then shot himself, Galena Park Independent School District officials said.
This morning at North Shore Senior High School, a student was arrested.
He was searched, handcuffed, and placed in the back of a police car.
While in the car, the student retrieved a hidden gun and shot himself.
Paramedics were called and quickly arrived on scene.
He was transported to the hospital still conscious when he left.
His family accompanied him to the hospital.
Students at North Shore Senior High School remain safe.
Counselors are available for students as needed.
In a follow-up email to NBC News, Frey said the gun was apparently hidden well enough to evade detection when the student was frisked prior to being placed in the patrol car.
The Harris County Sheriff s Office will investigate the shooting, Moore said.
There’s a British expression that seems particularly appropriate here: cop a load of this.

Not that the PL1 is going to be used in any sting operations.
It will be used mostly at shows and events to promote motorcycle safety, but Ariel boss Simon Saunders is keen to emphasise that the Atom is ready for work, finished in Avon and Somerset Constabulary colours and with a working light unit and rescue equipment.
If a police officer is driving it, then it’s a police vehicle,” he told us from the company’s HQ in Crewkerne, Somerset.
If it is, then we predict any such pursuits will be over quickly.
Saunders says that Ariel was happy to lend the car, as so many of the company’s staff are riders.
Almost everyone here has a motorcycle license,” he said.

Most of us have a love hate relationship with police cars.
We hate seeing them in the rear-view mirror when we re going a little too fast on the highway, but they can also be a welcome sight when we re in need of assistance.
Officers use police cars for many things: to patrol their beats, to chase suspects , to store their gear, to restrain criminals and even as communications links.
Some specialized police vehicles do even more than that.
An unbelievable scene took place in Washington State when activist and former congressional candidate Gavin Seim turned the tables around a cop demanding his ID and giving him a warning for illegally patrolling in an unmarked car!
In a very polite and calm manner, Seim stopped the unmarked police cruiser and let his camera roll.
Seim, with the officer, who was later identified as Deputy Canfield of the Grant County Sheriff’s Office, replying yes.
Okay, you re not allowed to have patrol cars that are unmarked .
Seim.
And guess what?
The officer complied and gave his ID!
I appreciate the cooperation.
Seim, to which the officer replies yes.
Okay, it s completely in violation of Washington State law and you are culpable in that, in the way the law is written,  Seim tells him.  So you ve admitted that you are in violation of Washington state law and that you were stopping people in this vehicle, so what I am going to encourage you to do, um, I m not going to write you up today, what I am going to encourage you to do is, take this car back.
After filming the video and sharing it online, Seim uploaded a lengthy post on his website Callmegav .
In Washington we have unmarked police vehicles impersonating citizens.
If you think it’s not a serious issue, try asking those that have been raped or lost loves ones because of unmarked cars.
It’s already illegal in WA for public vehicles to be unmarked, unless designated for “special undercover or confidential investigative purposes,” he wrote.
Ordinary looking unmarked police cars slink around and entrap, so they can write folks up  read tax  for petty faults.
That’s not protecting.
But this is also a major safety issue.
Seim goes on to recommend that citizens should check the law in their respective states and see if its legal for officers to patrol in unmarked vehicles.
If it’s a local police unit and they refuse to comply, report the offense to your County sheriff who is responsible to make sure the law is followed.
According to Seim, citizens should  ALWAYS film the encounter  and shouldn t be afraid to demand an ID from an undercover officer.

Relatives said that Ms Ferreira was treated with brutality probably because police suspected she was involved with the local drug gangs.
They thought she was a criminal and that is why they took her away.
Tais Lima, told O Globo newspaper.
They grabbed my mother by the legs and dumped her in the boot like an animal.
They didn t even bother to check if the boot was properly closed.

Due to limited space at our main facility, these historic vehicles are kept off-site at a variety of locations.
Many of these cars can be seen throughout the year at a variety of public events, including the Greenwood Car Show, Seattle s Fire Festival, Seattle s Pride Parade, Torchlight Parade, Ellensburg Rodeo Parade and other events throughout the region.
These vintage vehicles enhance positive interaction with the  public while      also educating the community about the history  of policing, as well as generating interest in restoration and preservation.
MONTEREY PARK >> Two police officers escaped injury when their car was struck by two shotgun blasts in an ambush late Thursday in Monterey Park, officials said.
Garvey and New avenues, Monterey Park police Lt.
Scott Wiese said.
The officers were watching over the parking lot of a 7-Eleven store across the street when their car was struck from behind by gunfire, the lieutenant said.
All of a sudden, they heard two shots,” Wiese said.
They said it was really loud, like a shotgun blast.
The officers sped out of the parking lot to escape the gunfire, he said.
They didn’t see the shooter.
Monterey Park police, joined by officers from neighboring cities, swarmed the area in search of the attacker, Wiese said.
The shooter remained at-large early Friday morning.
The shots were fired from north of the parking lot where the shooting took place, Wiese said.
The area is occupied by a gated commercial lot, a vacant lot and the rear area of an apartment building.
Police summoned crime lab officials to the scene to examine the forensic and ballistic evidence.
Anyone with information can reach the Monterey Park Police Department at 626-573-1311.

JEANNETTE  KDKA  – A man from Jeannette is accused of trying to steal an assault rifle from a police car.
It started when Jeannette Police officer Cpl.
Christopher Mason was tending to reports inside the station.
As he was in doing paper work, he looked up and saw a gentleman reaching in or leaning into the passenger side of our one police car, car 1-3.
At first he thought it was his partner,” said Cpl.
Jeffrey Stahl, of Jeannette Police.
But police say it turned out to be 31-year-old Jimmie Joe Berggren Jr.
Cpl.
Mason didn’t like what he saw and ran out to confront Berggren while he was walking away.
At that point, Officer Mason told him to stop; he refused to stop,” said Cpl.
Stahl.
And it was – an AR-15 assault rifle with a full magazine.
After three commands of him to drop the weapon, he ended up dropping the weapon,” said Cpl.
Stahl.
Thank God that Officer Mason didn’t have to take this gentleman’s life.
Berggren was charged with theft of a firearm and other counts.
But why did he take it?
The defendant in this case stated he was going to try to sell it,” said Cpl.
Stahl.
He is currently being held in the Westmoreland County Prison on $45,000 bail.

The Braintree, MA man painted his Maserati to replicate the “Transformers” character, Barricade.
An unidentified Braintree man was summoned to district court and charged with impersonating a police officer due to painting his Maserati to look like a police car.
The man painted his Maserati to replicate the “Transformers” character, Barricade .
The driver was stopped on Saturday, Aug.
Braintree Deputy Police Chief Wayne Foster passed the car in Braintree Square.
The Barricade police car look-alike is actually a 2010 Maserati Quattroporte , and typically costs $102,500 according to Uproxx.
The vehicle had police markings and “speed enforcement” lettered on its rear bumper, police said.
No we don’t have a Maserati in our fleet, although that would be nice,” the Braintree Police Department wrote on Facebook.

Jose Sanchez was about to give three tacos to a customer when a black BMW slammed into his family’s restaurant late Sunday night in the Little Village neighborhood on the West Side.
We heard a car braking and then a boom,” said Sanchez, 27.
A Chicago police car was damaged late Sunday when it was struck by a vehicle in the Lawndale neighborhood.
A Chicago police car was damaged late Sunday when it was struck by a vehicle in the Lawndale neighborhood.
Sanchez, 27, who was working as a cashier at Sanchez Tacos, 4001 W.
Police said the black BMW was speeding west on Ogden before hitting a Chicago police car sitting in traffic.
The car then crashed into a building at Ogden and Pulaski Road, said Officer Amina Greer, a Chicago police spokeswoman.
Two men inside the BMW were pronounced dead at the scene.
They later were identified as Hugo Rodriguez, 27, and Jahaziel Duron, 21, according to the Cook County medical examiner s office.
The police sergeant was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Greer said.
At the crash scene, bricks were missing from the northeast corner and from the north side of the building into which the car crashed.
The crushed black BMW was nearby, and about 200 feet to the northeast a Chevy Tahoe SUV, mangled at the front, sat in the middle of Ogden Avenue.
Debris from the crash littered the Ogden and Pulaski intersection, which police blocked off with yellow and red police tape for several hours.
Small pieces of a smashed fire hydrant lay on the southeast corner of the intersection.
Sanchez said that as soon as he realized the car crashed into the building, he and the other worker turned off the gas line in the restaurant.
The grill was on and everything,” Sanchez said.
Sanchez said the landowner of the space where Sanchez Tacos is located has insurance and should be able to fix the building.
But it was unclear how long the repairs would take.
More than  three weeks ago, Sanchez recalled watching an unoccupied building on the same block go up in flames, worrying that the blaze would affect his family’s restaurant, which has been around for about 10 years.
The extra-alarm fire started early Sept.
23 and destroyed the two-story commercial building, which housed a banquet hall on the second floor and a recording studio on the first floor, according to Chicago Fire Department officials.
It’s crazy,” Sanchez said.
Bullet damage to Lake Stevens police car.
MARYSVILLE — A man apparently armed with a high-capacity rifle and driving a pickup went on a shooting rampage against police in three Snohomish County cities Wednesday night before police shot him and took him into custody in Marysville, police said.
Wednesday when a man in a white pickup truck shot several rounds at the Granite Falls police station and patrol cars Wednesday night.
From there, the man apparently drove to the Lake Stevens police station and opened fire on patrol cars, police said.
No one was injured in either of the initial shootings.
64th Avenue NE in Marysville, where he shot at another police car.
Police fired on the man, who stopped just east of the intersection of 51st Avenue NE and Grove Street.
He was shot and taken into custody, police said.
The suspect obeyed officer commands, police said, and got out of the vehicle once he was shot.
The Snohomish County Sheriff’s office said that the suspect is a 43-year-old Granite Falls man.
He remains at Providence Regional Medical Center, where his injuries are not life-threatening, the Snohomish Sheriff’s office said in a press release.
Marysville police Sgt.
James Maples was injured, but was treated and released from Providence Medical Center in Everett.
Maples has been with the department for 19 years.
Investigators have confirmed that several firearms have been found in and near the truck driven by the suspect.
It sounds like the same guy, a person who was in a pickup truck,” Taylor said of all the shootings at police.
However, Snohomish County Sheriff’s deputies said it was not known for sure if all the incidents were related.
Grove Street from 67th Avenue NE to 51st Avenue NE will be closed for the investigation and drivers are asked to avoid the area for the morning commute.
Some school buses were delayed Thursday morning in Marysville as investigation into the shootings continued.

Where did you hear a cop got shot in the head?
I heard just in the leg and the cop is ok.
I never read the cop was shot in the head.
I read the cop was shot but was going to be ok.
The shooter is the one in grave condition.
Ann it’s people like you who spreads the wrong rumor’s.
Read the hole story not just bits and pieces and then you won’t start the wrong rumor’s.
Just joking CH.
Agreed at least they found room in the article to say ” high capacity rifle” twice even though they have no idea what weapon was used since “several weapons were found in the vehicle”.
Ferguson.
My friend who works at Providence, says he’s been in the morgue since last night, and doesn’t understand why the media is reporting that the shooter is recovering from non-life threatening injuries.
Oh, and the Herald is reporting the victim to be at harborview.
The media coverage is a joke.
Sandy Hook and the Boston bombing was?
I don’t have a problem with someone going after the pigs but he should have taken down a few NIG GAS first.
At least I know the guy wasn’t black……he’s alive!
I’m sorry, but there is no justifying a cop anywhere  head or not  just for the mere fact that he she is a cop.
I come from a family of law enforcement officers and the mere suggestion that any cop deserves it is insulting.
That said, we do not know the full story and the motives – hopefully this will become clear in the days to come.
On another hand, every time I see a shooting, my first hunch is some anti-gunner facilitated or instigated this, as it just fuels their argument for more gun control, with which only cops and criminals would be armed, and the rest of us, not.
Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.
It’s very off the cuff.
I had about 60 seconds from the moment I thought “NOW is the time to address this” and flagged the officer over, to the moment I was engaging him.
Grant County and it’s subordinate agencies in compliance with the law.
In Washington we have unmarked police vehicles impersonating citizens.
If you think it’s not a serious issue, try asking those that have been raped or lost loves ones because of unmarked cars.
I’ll post the legal details and debunk the myths at the bottom.
It’s also worth noting that this was not the first the Grant County Sheriff’s office heard about this.
I called about a month ago and filed an official report addressing my concern with unmarked cars in the area.
Tolerating lawlessness does not fix anything and at this stage of our decline, neither does writing a letter.
I get called every possible name for taking up the liberty conversation.
Sadly many Americans hate America and hate liberty.
But as in my courthouse incident , standing firm and principled works.
If I’m dealing with a disrespectful tyrant, I put them in their place.
It’s a matter of safety to never allow a bully to feel they can intimidate you.
We can stand up them.
Thankfully that was not a problem today because Deputy Canfield handled this well.
I informed him of the law and and he now has the opportunity to fix it.
I want officers to treat people with respect and I in turn do the same.
Disrespectful public servants should never be tolerated, respectful ones should be commended.
Ordinary looking unmarked police cars slink around and entrap, so they can write folks up  read tax  for petty faults.
That’s not protecting.
But this is also a major safety issue .
Unmarked vehicles are a ripe opportunity for confusion in a citizens reaction and for criminals to impersonate lawful authority to get people to stop.
People have been raped and even murdered because of this, so the law is good sense.
In WA, all municipal and police vehicles must be marked UNLESS they fall under special exemptions.
These exemptions do not apply to patrol vehicles.
There’s even a past WA State court precedent where a man fled police and his felony charge was thrown out because the pursuing vehicle was not legal.
Pretty interesting.
There have also been traffic infractions thrown out because the officers car was not marked.
Ask yourself.
Do you want your sisters and daughters stopped on the road, not knowing if they are facing an officer or a killer until it’s too late?
Check the laws in your State and if you see an unmarked vehicles running around your community, go question your officers.
If it’s a local police unit and they refuse to comply, report the offense to your County sheriff who is responsible to make sure the law is followed.
In this case we have local police, Sheriff and State police violating our law, so we have work to do.
If there is no law in your State, call your legislator and demand that it be addressed for the safety of our roads.
If you’re stopped by an unmarked vehicle I would not suggest running.
But don’t pull over on a dark lonely street either.
Indicate to the officer that you see him, drive to an occupied well lit area like a gas station.
You can also dial 911 and confirm if the officer at your location is legit.
And if you question that an officer might now not be who he says he is, don’t be afraid to demand ID.
We have a right to be safe on our streets.
Finally, ALWAYS film the encounter.
I cannot stress this enough.
If you stand your ground, stand principled and film everything, you will be much safer than cowering before lawless authority.
It’s our job to police the government.
We the people have all the authority and we must hold them accountable.
I wrote an article here with some tips on filming police.
UPDATE 10 21 14: I went in yesterday  to setup an official meeting with Grant County Sheriff Tom Jones so we could address compliance with State law and have an open dialogue.
15 minutes after I set the meeting, I received a message from his office saying he WILL NOT allow recording and there will be NO MEETING if I’m recording.
We showed up anyways for the meeting and he met with us in the lobby.
The government apologists have been working to convince people this law does not apply to police.
This is ridiculous since that’s the main point of the law, but I want to take it on with facts.
Kevin Schmadeka actually started this conversation back in 2011 and there’s a good fact sheet on it here.
065.
MYTH: The spin machine asserts that since the word “OR” is in the sentence it must therefore separate the structure.
They assert that exempt vehicles include “sheriff AND “local police” AND “local peace officers” undercover.
While it can be a tad confusing when you think about it, it does not take an expert linguist to debunk this lie and it would never stand in court.
The wording is actually clear.
FACT: “undercover or confidential investigative” requirement applies to all the vehicles in that sentence.
Why?
If that sentence did in fact cover two separate categories of vehicles, they would be noted with an  a  and a  b .
When clear separation is worded in, it’s made very clear.
If understanding the English context is not enough, the laws it’s intent can be traced back to the memos of the bill written my the legislative auditor of Washington State.
Legislative Auditor Thomas R.
Hazzard, in a memo dated January 31, 1975.
Some also suggest that State Patrol  WSP  can exempt any car they want, because there is a note in section  3  that states ” Traffic control vehicles of the Washington state patrol” may be exempted by the chief.
Note that this section is only for WSP.
But it still does not exempt them.
Traffic Control Vehicles are not and have never been patrol cars.
They are the vehicles that do things like guide you through a Construction Zone.
The WSP picked up on this as a way to break the law and convince people they were not.
Sadly we have allowed them to get away with it.
This law was instituted in 1937.
It was a one section law that applied to all agencies equally.
Then, there was no exception but for “special or general police purpose”.
That description was clarified in the 1975 alteration to define the exemption as “special undercover or confidential investigative purposes“.
Here is the original text of the law, found in chapter 189 of the 1937 session laws.
Sec46: It shall be unlawful for any public officer having charge of any vehicle owned by the State of Washington or by any county, city, town or other public body in this state and used in public business to operate the same upon the public highways of this state unless and until there shall be painted upon such automobile or other motor vehicle in letters of contrasting color not less than two  2  inches in Public vehicles, name of department.
State of Washington” or the name of such county, city, town or other public body, together with the name of the department or office upon the business of which the said vehicle is used: Provided, Exceptions.
This section shall not apply to vehicles of the Washington State Patrol, sheriff’s office, police department, or any vehicles used by peace officers under public authority for special or general police purpose : Provided, It shall be lawful and constitute compliance with the provisions of this section for any department or office to adopt and use in lieu of the lettering required a distinctive insignia, approved by the state commission on equipment, and bearing substantially the same information as required herein.
In 1975 the law added sections, making different restrictions for State vehicles versus local or County vehicles.
The use of the language when taken in it’s simple original form clearly illustrated the meaning.
The use of OR is not defining all officers as exempt at all.
That it would would defeat the primary intent of the law and conflicts with even the current version and structure.
You can find all revisions in the WA State Session Laws .
The bottom line is that the law is clear and to suggest that any of it’s text exempts local police and sheriffs entirely is ridiculous and denies the grammatical structure of American English, the text of the bill and the published intent of the bill.

Armored vehicles that protected American forces in places like Iraq having a second life here at home.
Since 1995, the Pentagon has given $4 billion worth of military equipment to local police forces, everything from tactical gear to weapons to those mine resistant, ambush protected vehicles known as MRAPs.
This September, the sheriff s department took delivery of a fully armored, mine resistant vehicle or MRAP, the same equipment used by soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Shawn Lamouree runs the emergency response team.
I don t expect to see insurgents with RPGs,  he said.  I don t expect to see roadside bombs.
The vehicle is unarmed -- its gun turret has been removed -- but the reinforced steel doors and pressurized cab offer protection not afforded by a patrol car.
I would be remiss at doing my job if I didn t prepare for the worst,  said Bud York, the Warren County sheriff.  I m tasked with protecting the public and protecting my people.
The $650,000, 5-mile-to-the-gallon MRAP, and this armored Humvee, came free of charge through a defense department program that transfers surplus equipment to state and local police departments.
Last November, the Boise, Idaho, police department used its MRAP to arrest a kidnapping suspect believed to be barricaded with explosives.
Warren County dispatched its armored vehicles to hostage situations twice last fall.
The guy saw the armored vehicle, he walks out and gives himself up,  York said.  Just by looking at the vehicle.
He came out.
So does Kara Dansky, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.
To her, military-grade equipment has no place in civilian law enforcement and says her research has shown it can actually increase violence.
Why is a warrior mentality problematic in civilian law enforcement officers?
I don t buy that,  York responded.  I think that s poppycock.
I think it depends on the agency, it depends on the training.
We re a very professional agency here.
None of my guys are ever going to be placed in danger.
And that s why I m glad we have it.
Warren County did pay to have the vehicles delivered and painted.
Seized drug money covered all costs.

Footage shows cop ran a stop sign but arrested a sober victim for drunken driving.
We’re often told by security professionals that the widespread adoption of surveillance cameras can hold officers accountable  and provide valuable evidence for court proceedings.
One Wisconsin woman is living proof that sometimes CCTV footage, used in conjunction with other evidence, really can serve the cause of justice.
Wisconsin resident Tanya Weyker was involved in a serious car crash with Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Joseph Quiles’ vehicle in February of last year.
Quiles rolled through a stop sign and “T-boned” her car, breaking her neck and wrecking her vehicle.
Ever since, the 25-year-old woman has been trying to regain a semblance of her former life.
To add insult to injury, until quite recently, Weyker was facing drunken driving charges stemming solely from Quiles’ testimony at the time of the crash.
Weyker was arrested after the accident on the charge that she appeared to be intoxicated—even though the arresting officer could not administer field sobriety tests due to the serious nature of Weyker’s injuries.
All the while, undiscovered surveillance footage showed that Quiles, not Weyker, had caused the crash.
I explained to him my eyes were red and glassy because I was crying,” Weyker stated.
Her attorney, Todd Korb, further noted the surprising nature of this arrest, given the lack of evidence that she was drunk at the time.
I can’t say it is necessarily a cover up, but it is suspicious,” Korb told  CNN .
Video footage from a nearby airport surveillance camera recently surfaced, showing that the officer caused the crash by failing to stop at a stop sign.
Furthermore, the results of drug and alcohol tests administered at the hospital became available and confirmed Weyker’s sobriety at the time of the crash.
An internal investigation at the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office launched after the incident further vindicated Weyker.
In a recorded interrogation, the officer admits that he was at fault for the accident.
Deputy Quiles: “Yes.
Quiles has never officially been disciplined for misreporting the accident.
Rather, he was suspended for nine days for violating traffic laws and damaging county equipment.
He has filed for permanent disability, but his claim is still pending before the County’s Employee Retirement System, according to The Raw Story .
Reports written at the time of the crash described Quiles’ injuries as minor, and he was treated and released from a hospital following the wreck.
Nevertheless, since the crash, Quiles allegedly told a judge in a child support hearing that he was on medical leave, The Raw Story reports.
Since Quiles  admission, Weyker has been seeking compensation for her medical bills from the county, which she claims are greater than $1 million, although a state law caps such awards against government agencies at $250,000.
She has also filed a separate lawsuit against the arresting officer and might pursue a civil rights lawsuit against the county  which is not subject to a damages cap .
Neither the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office nor Weyker’s attorney, Todd Korb, responded to Ars  requests for comment on Thursday afternoon.

The San Carlos couple injured in a crash with a police car which caused subsequently rammed into eight cyclists told their side of the story exclusively to NBC 7 s Dave Summers on Sept.

An accident in Barrio Logan between a motorist, a San Diego Police officer and eight cyclists sent five people to the hospital Sunday.
Harbor Drive.
Scott and Camille Martin of San Carlos were in the convertible with the hard top down.
Both suffered multiple injuries ranging from bumps and bruises to broken bones.
It was a split second,  Scott said.  The car appeared right in front of me.
The Martins say they had the green light and didn t hear a siren prior to the crash.
At the very last second, I saw him and then, the impact and then spun.
Camille recalls.
It s not clear whether the officer was driving with lights activated.
The officer was a block away from the call at the time of the crash.
The collision spun the officer’s car up on to the sidewalk and into eight cyclists.
All eight crash victims were visitors from Brazil in town for a four day convention.
They were riding on bicycles they had rented to tour the city.
The rear window of the patrol car was shattered.
One bike ended up underneath the patrol car.
The Martins feel the San Diego Police Department needs to reexamine its policy on responding to calls.
Camille and Scott Martin talk with NBC 7 about what they remember seeing moments before their convertible collided with a San Diego police cruiser.
My concern is I’ve seen it more than once where  blowing through intersections at red lights.
They often don’t use their sirens to clear the intersection like you typically would see with other emergency vehicles and I think that endangers everybody including the officer,” said Scott Martin.
Scott Martin said he spoke with investigators and was not cited.
He and his wife are grateful to the EMTs for their care and help in the moments after their crash.
They also credit the car s airbags and seat belts for saving them from greater harm.
Obviously it is a scary sight anytime you have a vehicle that collides with a pedestrian on foot or on a bike it is a dangerous situation.
Fortunately all the cyclists had helmets on and I think that prevented serious injuries in this case,” Lt.
Paul Connelly said.
The intersection was closed for three hours afterward.
When NBC 7 asked for comment and a copy of possible video from the accident, the SDPD said its traffic division is conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and no further information is available at this time.

You re heading down the road and suddenly a police car is hugging your bumper with lights blaring.
How did we NOT notice them hiding behind a bush, especially seeing as police tracking app Trapster is a download on the Apple   AAPL   iPhone sitting on the passenger seat!
Instantly, a tingling sensation of fear spreads from head to toe, and a wandering mind ensues - an ugly ticket that will cause higher monthly insurance payments is 15 minutes away.
However, unlike in yesteryear when cops would approach wrongdoers with wimpy looking cars that looked like they could be outrun, many police departments are wielding a secret weapon in 2014, a true beast on four wheels: the Ford   F   Interceptor.
Not only will the visual appearance of the vehicle, along with its blinding, flashing front bar lights freak you out during a pull over, the vehicle  the Interceptor s competitors are the Dodge Charger from Chrysler and the Caprice from General Motors   GM    is so visually intimidating that it makes you think twice about passing it doing 5mph over the speed limit on a busy highway.
Obviously, this intimidation factor is the main point.

GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- When it comes to police squad cars, most would choose to stay far away from the backseat and the trouble that could mean.
On Thursday, a small passenger hopped in, apparently out of simple curiosity.
The Grand Rapids Police Department posted a photo on its Facebook page, showing a squirrel peering out from the rear window of a squad car on an Eastown street.
The  creature was right next to a half-opened car window.
The animal avoided any time in lock-up and was released back into nature.
