This article is about the company.
For photocopying, see photocopier .
Xerox Corporation Ltd.
American multinational document management corporation that produces and sells a range of color and black-and-white printers , multifunction systems, photocopiers , digital production printing presses, and related consulting services and supplies.
Xerox is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut  moved from Stamford, Connecticut in October 2007 ,  though its largest population of employees is based around Rochester, New York , the area in which the company was founded.
4 billion.
The deal closed on February 8, 2010.
4] As a large developed company, it is consistently placed in the list of Fortune 500 companies.
Researchers at Xerox and its Palo Alto Research Center invented several important elements of personal computing , such as the desktop metaphor GUI , the computer mouse  and desktop computing .
6] These features were frowned upon by the then board of directors, who ordered the Xerox engineers to share them with Apple technicians.
The features were taken on by Apple and, later, Microsoft .
Partly thanks to these features, these two firms would then go on to duopolize the personal computing world.
The Xerox 914 was the first one-piece plain paper photocopier, and sold in the millions.
Xerox was founded in 1906 in Rochester as The Haloid Photographic Company,  which originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment.
Joseph C.
Wilson , credited as the  founder of Xerox,  took over Haloid from his father.
He saw the promise of Carlson s invention and, in 1946, signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product.
Wilson remained as President CEO of Xerox until 1967 and served as Chairman until his death in 1971.
Looking for a term to differentiate its new system, Haloid coined the term Xerography from two Greek roots meaning  dry writing .
Haloid subsequently changed its name to Haloid Xerox in 1958 and then Xerox Corporation in 1961.
Before releasing the 914, Xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype hand-operated equipment known as the Flat-plate 1385.
The 1385 was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation.
As a consequence, it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market, perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the Addressograph-Multigraph Multilith 1250 and related sheet-fed offset printing presses.
It was little more than a high quality, commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera , complete with photo-flood lighting and timer.
The glass film plate had been replaced with a selenium-coated aluminum plate.
Clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film.
A skilled user could produce fast, paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method.
Having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry, Xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offset s market share.
The 1385 was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer, the Copyflo, in 1955.
The Copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative.
Following the Copyflo, the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 microfilm printer.
At about half the size and weight, this still sizable machine printed onto hand-fed, cut-sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars.
A scaled-down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier.
The company came to prominence in 1959 with the introduction of the Xerox 914,   the most successful single product of all time.  The 914, the first plain paper photocopier was developed by Carlson and John H.
Dessauer ;  it was so popular that by the end of 1961 Xerox had almost $60 million in revenue.
Revenues leaped to over $500 million by 1965.
The company expanded substantially throughout the 1960s, making millionaires of some long-suffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product.
In 1960, a xerography research facility called the Wilson Center for Research and Technology was opened in Webster, New York .
In 1961, the company changed its name to Xerox Corporation.
Xerox common stock  XRX  was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1961 and on the Chicago Stock Exchange in 1990.
In 1963 Xerox introduced the Xerox 813 , the first desktop plain-paper copier, realizing Carlson s vision of a copier that could fit on anyone s office desk.
Ten years later in 1973, a basic, analogue, color copier, based on the 914, followed.
The 914 itself was gradually sped up to become the 420 and 720.
The 813 was similarly developed into the 330 and 660 products and, eventually, also the 740 desktop microfiche printer.
Xerox s first foray into duplicating, as distinct from copying, was with the Xerox 2400, introduced in 1966.
Although still some way short of offset speeds, this machine introduced the industry s first Automatic Document Feeder, Slitter Perforator, and Collator  sorter .
This product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the Xerox 3600 Duplicator.
Meanwhile, a small lab team was borrowing 914 copiers and modifying them.
The lab was working on a project called the  Long Distance Xerography   LDX  project.
The aim was to be able to connect two copiers together via the public telephone network, such that a document scanned on one machine would be copied out on the other.
The LDX system was introduced in 1964.
Many years later this work came to fruition in the Xerox Telecopiers, seminal to today s fax machines .
The fax operation in today s multifunction copiers is true to Carlson s original vision for these devices.
C.
Peter McColough , a longtime executive of Haloid and Xerox took over as CEO from Joseph Wilson in 1968.
In 1968 the company consolidated its headquarters at Xerox Square in downtown Rochester with its iconic 30-story Xerox Tower .
In 2007 the headquarters was moved to Stamford, Connecticut, but most of the office staff remained in Rochester.
In 2009 Xerox decided to sell the property, and the sale was completed in 2013, with Xerox continuing to lease space for the remaining approximately 1400 employees.
Xerox embarked on a series of acquisitions.
R.
Bowker in 1967.
In 1969, Xerox acquired Scientific Data Systems  SDS .
It renamed the division Xerox Data Systems  XDS  and produced the Sigma line and its successor the XDS 5xx series of mainframe computers in the 1960s and 1970s.
XDS was sold to Honeywell in 1975.
Former manufacturing facility in Henrietta, New York , constructed in the 1960s and sold to Harris RF Communications in 2010.
Archie McCardell was named president of the company in 1971.
13] During his tenure, Xerox introduced the Xerox 6500, its first color copier .
14] During McCardell s reign at Xerox, the company announced record revenues , earnings and profits in 1973, 1974, and 1975.
In the mid-1970s, Xerox introduced the  Xerox 9200 Duplicating System .
Originally designed to be sold to print shops, to increase their productivity, it was twice a fast as the 3600 duplicator at two impressions per second  7200 per hour .
In a 1975 Super Bowl commercial for the 9200, Xerox debuted an advertising campaign featuring  Brother Dominic , a monk who used the 9200 system to save decades of manual copying.
Following these years of record profits, in 1975, Xerox resolved an anti-trust suit with the United States Federal Trade Commission  FTC , which at the time was under the direction of Frederic M.
Scherer .
The Xerox consent decree resulted in the forced licensing of the company s entire patent portfolio, mainly to Japanese competitors.
S.
In 1979, Xerox purchased Western Union as the basis for its proposed Xerox Telecommunications Network  XTEN  for local-loop communications.
However, after three years, in 1982, the company decided the idea was a mistake and sold its assets to MCI at a loss.
David T.
Kearns , a Xerox executive since 1971, took over as CEO in 1982.
The company was revived in the 1980s and 1990s, through improvement in quality design and realignment of its product line.
Attempting to expand beyond copiers, in 1981 Xerox introduced a line of electronic memory typewriters, the Memorywriter, which gained 20% market share, mostly at the expense of IBM.
In 1983 Xerox bought Crum & Forster , an insurance company, and formed Xerox Financial Services  XFS  in 1984.
R.
Bowker.
In 1990 Paul Allaire , a Xerox executive since 1966, succeeded David Kearns, who had reached mandatory retirement age.
Allaire disentangled Xerox from the financial services industry.
Development of digital photocopiers in the 1990s and a revamp of the entire product range again gave Xerox a technical lead over its competitors.
Digital photocopiers were essentially high-end laser printers with attached scanners, known as Multi Function Machines, or just MFMs, which were able to be attached to computer networks.
Xerox worked to turn its product into a service, providing a complete document service to companies including supply, maintenance, configuration, and user support.
To reinforce this image, in 1994 the company introduced a corporate signature,  The Document Company , above its main logo and introduced a red digital X.
The digital X symbolized the transition of documents between the paper and digital worlds.
In the mid-1990s LA County Superior Court turned to Xerox for help in replacing nearly 500 aging copiers throughout LA County, but Xerox refused to consider leasing.
The County instead went to Konica and introduced the concept of leasing of copiers for the first time in the industry.
Xerox was shut out of the County for the next two years.
In April 1999 Allaire was succeeded by Richard Thoman , who had been brought in from IBM in 1997 as president.
The first  outsider  to head Xerox Thoman became a victim of internal politics, and he was forced to resign in 2000.
After Thoman s resignation Allaire again resumed the position of CEO and served until the appointment of Anne M.
Mulcahy , another long-term Xerox executive.
19] Xerox s turnaround was largely led by Mulcahy, who was appointed president in May 2000, CEO in August 2001 and chairman in January 2002.
20] She launched an aggressive turnaround plan that returned Xerox to full-year profitability by the end of 2002, along with decreasing debt, increasing cash, and continuing to invest in research and development.
In 2000, Xerox acquired Tektronix color printing and imaging division in Wilsonville, Oregon, for US$925 million.
This led to the current Xerox Phaser line of products as well as Xerox solid ink printing technology.
In September 2004, Xerox celebrated the 45th anniversary of the Xerox 914.
More than 200,000 units were made around the world between 1959 and 1976, the year production of the 914 was stopped.
Today, the 914 is part of American history as an artifact in the Smithsonian Institution .
In November 2006, Xerox completed the Acquisition of XMPie .
XMPie, the leading provider of software for cross-media, variable data one-to-one marketing, offers solutions to help businesses create and manage highly-effective direct marketing and cross-media campaigns.
In October 2008, Xerox Canada Ltd.
Toronto Star newspaper.
On May 21, 2009, it was announced that Ursula Burns would succeed Anne Mulcahy as CEO of Xerox.
On July 1, 2009, Burns became the first African American woman to head a company the size of Xerox.
4 Billion.
The acquisition was completed in February 2010.
11 a share for the company.
In May 2011, Xerox acquired NewField IT for an undisclosed sum.
24] NewField IT developed the Asset DB toolset which is widely used across the managed print services  MPS  market along with MPS market-leading consulting and software services delivering a large impact for this relatively small acquisition.
5 million in cash.
The laser printer was invented in 1969 by Xerox researcher Gary Starkweather by modifying a Xerox 7000 copier.
Xerox management was afraid the product version of Starkweather s invention, which became the 9700, would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until IBM launched the 3800 laser printer in 1976.
The first commercial non-impact printer was the Xerox 1200, introduced in 1973,  based on the 3600 copier.
It had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer Phil Chen.
In 1977, following IBM s laser printer introduction, the Xerox 9700 was introduced.
Laser printing eventually became a multi-billion-dollar business for Xerox.
In the late 1970s Xerox introduced the  Xerox 350 color slide system  This product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic 35mm slides.
Many of the concepts used in today s  Photo Shop  programs were pioneered with this technology.
This product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost, but rather to show the innovation of Xerox.
It did take off with many customers, but was soon replaced with its still smaller and lower cost 2700 Distributed Electronic Printer offering in 1982.
The Xerox Alto workstation was developed at Xerox PARC.
In 1970, under company president C.
Peter McColough , Xerox opened the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC.
The facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface  GUI , laser printing , WYSIWYG text editors and Ethernet .
From these inventions, Xerox PARC created the Xerox Alto in 1973, a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer .
This machine can be considered the first true Personal Computer, given its versatile combination of a cathode-ray-type screen, mouse-type pointing device, and a QWERTY-type alphanumeric keyboard.
But the Alto was never commercially sold, as Xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it.
It was, however, installed in Xerox s own offices, worldwide and those of the US Government and military, who could see the potential.
Within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by Xerox s own unique LAN, The Ethernet.
Data was sent around this system of heavy, yellow, low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system.
In addition, PARC also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites, the PARC Universal Packet  PUP .
In 1979, Steve Jobs made a deal with Xerox s venture capital division: He would let them invest $1 million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on.
Jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the WIMP  Window, Icon, Menu, and Pointing device  system and redirected development of the Apple Lisa to incorporate these technologies.
Jobs is quoted as saying,  They just had no idea what they had.  In 1980, Jobs invited several key PARC researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas.
In 1981, Xerox released a system similar to the Alto, the Xerox 8010 Star .
It was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers, such as a bitmapped display, window-based GUI, mouse, Ethernet networking, file servers , print servers and e-mail .
The Xerox 6085 Star, despite its technological breakthroughs, did not sell well due to its high price, costing $16,000 per unit.
A typical Xerox Star-based office, complete with network and printers, would have cost $100,000.
Apple instead bought rights to the Alto GUI and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer, aimed towards the business and education markets.
The Apple Macintosh was released in 1984, and was the first personal computer to popularize the GUI and mouse amongst the public.
In 2002 PARC was spun off into an independent wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox.

Xerox offers numerous partnership programs such as, being an Authorized Sales Agent, North American Reseller Sales  NARS , Xerox Business Innovation Partnership Program, and Xerox Premier Partners Global Network.
One can also create their own agency, such as Paper Trail Solutions , in North Carolina and Documaxx, in Texas.
Xerox today manufactures and sells a wide variety of office and production equipment including LCD Monitors, photo copiers , Xerox Phaser printers, multifunction printers , large-volume digital printers as well as workflow software under the brand strategy of FreeFlow.
Xerox also sells scanners and digital presses.
On May 29, 2008, Xerox launched the Xerox iGen4 Press.
Xerox sells both color and black-and-white printers under the Xerox Phaser and ColorQube brand, with the color consumer model starting at US$299; the most expensive color model costs US$6,799.
Multifunction office color and black-and-white products are sold under the ColorQube , Phaser , and WorkCentre brands.
Xerox also produces fax machines, professional printers, black and white copiers,  and several other products.
In addition, Xerox produces many printing and office supplies such as paper in many forms, and solid ink that takes advantage of 2400 FinePoint technology; and markets software such as Xerox DocuShare , Xerox MarketPort and FlowPort, offers consulting services, ECM Digital Repository Services and printing outsourcing .

Xerox now sponsors the Factory Ducati Team in the World Superbike Championship, under the name of the  Xerox Ducati .
European operations, Rank Xerox , later extended to Asia and Africa, has been fully owned by Xerox Corporation since 1997.
The Rank Xerox name was discontinued following the buyout, and the Rank Xerox Research Centre was renamed to the Xerox Research Centre Europe.
On May 31, 2001, Xerox Corporation announced that its auditors, KPMG LLP, had certified Xerox s financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2000.
And the financials included some restatements.
31] On March 31, 2002, Xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than $2 billion.
S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against Xerox.
33] The complaint alleged Xerox deceived the public between 1997 and 2000 by employing several  accounting maneuvers,  the most significant of which was a change in which Xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a  sale  when a lease contract was signed, instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract.
At issue was when the revenue was recognized, not the validity of the revenue.
Xerox s restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized.
On December 20, 2002, Xerox Corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its non-cash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements, resulted in after-tax understatement of interest expense of approximately $5 million to $6 million or less than 1 cent per share in each of the four quarters of 2001 and for the first three quarters of 2002.
In response to the SEC s complaint, Xerox Corporation neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
It agreed to pay a $10 million penalty and to restate its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000.
On June 5, 2003, six Xerox senior executives accused of securities fraud settled their issues with the SEC and neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
They agreed to pay $22 million in penalties, disgorgement, and interest.
The company received approval to settle the securities lawsuit in 2008.
4 billion  gap  in pre-tax earnings.
48 million fine.
37] Meanwhile, Xerox paid a civil penalty of $10 million.
38] As part of the settlement KPMG neither admits nor denies wrongdoings.
During settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Xerox began to revamp itself once more.
As a symbol of this transformation, the relative size of the word  Xerox  was increased in proportion to  The Document Company  on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in September-2004, along with the digital X.
However, the digital X and  The Document Company  were still used by Fuji Xerox until April-2008.
The word  xerox  is used as a synonym for  photocopy   both as a noun and a verb  in many areas; for example, I xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk.  or  Please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam .
Though both are common, the company does not condone such uses of its trademark, and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of Xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts.
The company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that Xerox should not be used as a verb.
To this end, the company has written no publications that have used Xerox as a verb, and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that  you cannot  xerox  a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying machine .
Despite their efforts, many dictionaries continue to include the use of  xerox  as a verb, including the Oxford English Dictionary .

The Price to Earnings  P E  ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock s most        recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations        for the trailing 12 month period.
A company s net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.
Reflects the total market value of a company.
Market Cap is calculated by multiplying        the number of shares outstanding by the stock s price.
For companies with multiple        common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes.
Number of shares that are currently held by investors,        including restricted shares owned by the company s officers and        insiders as well as those held by the public.
The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade.
To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.
Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded.
A company s dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased.
Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report.
Exchanges report short interest twice a month.
Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.
Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock,     based on the value of trades made on an  uptick  in price and the value of     trades made on a  downtick  in price.
The up down ratio is calculated by     dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades.
Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

Please see the “condensed time line” section  the next one  for a time line of how the Xerox saga unfolded.
It for example depicts that I did not push the thing to the public right away, but gave Xerox a lot of time before I did so.
Personally, I think this is important.
I will post updates and links to the relevant blog posts in there in order not to make total crap out of this article s outline.
In this way, I keep this article up-to-date for future visitors and also write new blog posts on the topic for RSS users.
In this article I present in which way scanners   copiers of the Xerox WorkCentre Line randomly alter written numbers in pages that are scanned.
This is not an OCR problem  as we switched off OCR on purpose , it is a lot worse – patches of the pixel data are randomly replaced in a very subtle and dangerous way: The scanned images look correct at first glance, even though numbers may actually be incorrect.
Incorrect metering of medicine, even worse, I think.
WorkCentre and ColorQube scan copier families of the manufacturer Xerox – according to reseller data, hundreds of thousands of those machines are used across the planet.
I produce during the last years by scanning with xerox machines?
Did I even give them to others?
What dangers are imposed by such possible document errors?
Is there a danger of life for someone?
Can I be sued for such errors?
Before the bug was covered in my blog, it was not discovered or published, nor was its montrosity visible to Xerox or me.
It unleashed itself across several blog articles I wrote that were then spread further by the mass media.
What happened in which order can be seen in the time line below.
It has been an interesting time, I promise.
Originally, this blog article was published in the fear the bug would be dangerous enough to put lifes at risk and in the believe Xerox would not take the bug report serious.
The rest of the article is organized as follows.
After that, I give some technical detail and describe the scan parameters set.
Also, there will be a short manual how to reproduce this error.
Told Xerox about number mangling in pixel data.
During the next days, neither the Xerox support levels we had phoned, nor the Xerox helpdesks visiting, did know that character substitutions could occur at all and were amazed to see this.
The Xerox helpdesk guys even set out replicating the “bug” at their devices and managed to do so.
I think this is important as it depicts that I first went to Xerox and gave them about a week of time, before I posted it on my blog.
Later I was to learn that the number mangling was known to Xerox.
No solution from Xerox yet, nearly one week, across all support levels.
They either do not believe us or look amazed.
I think this is scary and write this blog post.
The blog post goes around the planet.
From now on, I get emails of people being able to replicate the “bug” around the world, as well as informations that JBIG2 compression can cause this.
I update this blog post a lot.
A reader tells me there is a small notice in his copier s admin panel about character substitution.
On his device, the “bug” can be avoided by setting compression from “normal” to higher.
As a consequence, the issue must have been known by Xerox – so why was nobody telling us?
As the notice only occurs when adjusting the setting in the admin panel, the implications, however, stay the same.
People may create false figures without knowing.
Anyway, I write a blog post presenting this workaround.
Conference call with Rick Dastin and Francis Tse.
Rick Dastin, Vice President at Xerox, is the first one actually working at Xerox being able to tell me that character substitutions actually can occur and Xerox knows  in contrast to their support .
They also tell me that this is wanted.
I criticize that this compression mode is called “normal”.
I also learn that there are two notices in the  300 page  manuals also, telling about character substitution, also with respect to “normal”.
Xerox publishes their first press statement .
Aside from this, they confirm the work around and tell the customers about the small notice.
Second Statement , Software patch announced, reads like the “normal” setting will be entirely eliminated by the patch.
In a further document, these factory settings are defined: Compression “higher”, at least 200 DPI.
With Compression “higher”  even advised in the Xerox press statements  and an even more generous resolution 300 DPI I reproduced number mangling on a Xerox device.
As I think this is a big deal as anyone could be affected, I told Xerox and wait until they confirmed to see number mangling with the same settings, too.
They confirm, and after that I wrote a detailed blog post about this .
On a Xerox WorkCentre 7545, all three compression modes seem to be affected.
A user reports the same using a WC 7655.
In these cases, numbers seem to be mangled independently from the compression mode, which makes the issue hard to avoid.
See blog post.
Xerox scanning issue fully confirmed .
They indeed implemented a software bug, eight years ago, and indeed, numbers could be mangled across all compression modes.
They have to roll out a patch for hundreds of thousands of devices world-wide.
On one hand, the implications might be of vital significance for Xerox now.
On the other hand, I am glad not to go down in history as the guy too dumb to read the manual.
First patches for Xerox scanning bug releasted.
Because of the large number of affected device types, the patches are going to be released in several waves.
I keep getting asked why I did not demand money from Xerox: There are reasons for this way of proceeding.

ColbertReport If I had one free wish on the #Xerox number-mangling issue, it would be a coverage in Colbert Report!
We got aware of the problem by scanning some construction plan last Wednesday and printing it again.
Construction problems contain a boxed square meter number per room.
Now in some rooms, we found beautifully lay-outed, but utterly wrong square meter numbers.
You really have to read the numbers to find out; this is why it is so hard to find out.
In the present case, we found out because one room in the construction plan was – as the copy told us – about 22 square meters large, whereas the next room, a lot larger, was assigned a label with 14 square meters.
Firstly, I present to you a complete original version of the affected construction plan part.
After this, the wrong numbers will be presented.
Click to enlarge.
I added the yellow marks myself to show you where the errors will occur.
Let us name the upper one “place 1”, the lower left “place 2” and the lower right “place 3”.
Now, let us scan the construction plan and get a PDF file from it.
No OCR, just plain image.
Yeah, couldn t believe it, too .
The screen shots of the erroneous places are organized in the below table.
There is one additional line in the table for the original patches.
The Xerox WorkCentre 7535 always produced the same errors; this is why we only need one line for it in the table.
In contrast, the WorkCentre 7556 randomly produced different numbers, this is why I present three lines for three runs with different errors.
I know that the resolution is not too fine, but the numbers are clearly readable.
Additionally, obviously,  these are no simple wrong pixels, but whole image patches are mixed up or copied.
I repeat: This is not an OCR problem, but of course, I can t have a look into the software itself, maybe OCR is still fiddling with the data even though we switched it off.
Next example: Some cost table, scanned on the WorkCentre 7535.
As we are used to, a correct-looking scan at the first glance, but take a closer look.
This error was found because usually, in such cost tables, the numbers are sorted ascending.
The 65 became an 85  second column, third line .
Edit: I m getting emails telling me that also a 60 in the upper right region of the image became a 80.
Thanks!
This is not a simple pixel error either, one can clearly see the characteristic dent the 8 has on the left side in contrast to a 6.
This scan is several weeks old – no one can say how many wrong documents have been produced by the Xerox machines in the mean time.
As the saga unfolded itself, in this section I built up a “hearsay list of affected devices” according to mails my readers sent to me.
As the bug is confirmed by xerox in the meantime, I was able to remove the word “hearsay”.
The letter x can be substituted by arbitrary digits in cases where whole device families are affected.
After the cost table, I printed some numbers, scanned them, OCRed them and compared them to the original ones.
As the OCR produces errors, by itself, one obviously has to check by hand for false positives when performing this.
I took Arial, 7pt as a test font, and the WorkCentre 7535 with the newer of the aboved named Software version as a test machine.
The scan settings were like above.
Observe how the sixes around the false eights look correct.
Also the false eights contain the characteristic dent again, so whole image patches have been replaced again.
The first page of the PDF scan with a few marked false eights mixed in by the 7535 WorkCentre.
The OCR was added by me later to be able to mark the numbers nicely, so be aware it may not be the original file, even though the image data in it is.
Due to the popular demand: All pages of the PDF scan without any post processing, just like they came out of the 7535.
Lots of pages.
This information has been confirmed by Xerox in the meantime.
The error does not occur if PDFs are scanned with OCR, or TIFs are scanned  the latter seems plausible, as the pure image data should be saved into the TIF .
Additionally, there seems to be a correlation between font size, scan dpi used.
I was able to reliably reproduce the error for 200 DPI PDF scans w o OCR, of sheets with Arial 7pt and 8pt numbers.
Overall it looks like some sort of compression algorithm using patches more than once  I think I could even identify some equally-pixeled eights .
Edit: It seems that the above thought was not that wrong at all.
Several mails I got suggest that the xerox machines use JBIG2 for compression .
Even though the specification only cover the JBIG2 decompression, in reality, there is often created a dictionary of image patches found to be “similar”.
Those patches then get reused instead of the original image data, as long as the error generated by them is not “too high”.
In this case, the pattern matching procedure for finding “similar” image patches seems to do its work too sloppy, which then seems to cause the classification of characters at similar, that actually are not the same.
Makes sense.
While JGIB2 is a powerful  de- compression standard, Xerox seemed to neglect has to be most aware of the following important aspect: If using pattern matching upon compression there is no guarantee that parts of the scanned image actually come from the corresponding place on the paper.
What comes out if pattern matching based compression is used at the wrong place, as it obviously is the case in business scan copiers, are documents that look perfectly right, but are incorrect in a subtle and dangerous way.
For this reason, no JBIG2 document encoded by such pattern matching techniques can ever provide legal certainty.
Is someone was to sue me given such documents, I would state “the document might be incorrect and you can t prove me wrong”.
The issue gets even more dangerous if life-important documents are scanned, like medical prescriptions.
Of course, if Xerox would have chosen the patch size in a way enabling whole, readable letters to fit into the patches, this would be grossly negligent.
Also, it would shed light on how these machines are tested, as when using some patch-based compression algorithm, it kind of suggests itself to test it with low-resolution, albeit still readable letters.
Might this be more than a Xerox problem?
This is another thing I keep getting asked all the time.
I m not quite sure.
JBIG2 is a powerful compression standard, but it can be pretty dangerous when misused, as we see.
The misusing, in particular using pattern matching techniques for compression at all in the first place, and the bug disabling the ability to turn it off, seems to be a Xerox individual “feature”.
The big deal is that users are unable to see that s something wrong, for the outcoming documents look perfectly fine.
Using a non-pattern matching based compression, one might recognize badly scanned numbers by for example black spots or other artifacts on them, but here, they are replaced by incorrect, despite nice-looking numbers.
This makes the error almost impossible to detect.
The issue has existed for eight years in Xerox machines, and *now* that people are aware, they all of a sudden are replicating it across the planet.
Posted on 2013-08-02        by         David Kriesel.
I am not familiar with the specifics of the Xerox copiers or with the JBIG2 standard.
However, I am familiar with some data compression standards.
One family of such algorithms compresses a string of data by building up a “glossary” of strings that are labeled and re-used later.
So if the string AABBCC occurs once and is given a label xyx, the next time that AABBCC occurs it is just replaced in the compressed string by xyx.
So what is transmitted is the compressed string xyx; this is supposed to be re-mapped back to AABBCC at the received end  or, in the case of the Xerox copier, printed .
Obviously, the re-mapping is supposed to give you back the original string.
But if something has gone wrong with the glossary-building process, the label will be mis-interpreted.
It is of course unacceptable that what are supposed to be photocopies be distorted in this way: It shows that Xerox is doing the image-compression first and then decompression and printing second.
Copiers have become nightmares but this really takes the cake!
It s not just photocopies.
These days there are archives of old and historic technical manuals.
Frequently the old manuals are scanned by people who really don t care about the quality of the result, but they do try to minimize file size.
Some of the results are truly horrible, and this patch substitution problem is very commonly present in an extreme form.
I work for Xerox and I had to hear this from outside sources like this one.
We have a Workcentre 3545 and I must say I haven t noticied the issue there, but then I haven t tried scanning documents with it.
I have a desktop scanner for that.
I did tell our techs about it and they hadn t heard anything.
And that s the scary part.
I ve read about this yesterday in bild der wissenschaft or spectrum der wissenschaft and I am so overwhelmed by this.
It is hard to think about all the possible mistakes this could have caused in different industries.
Just a nightmare!

Its commitment to a diverse workforce began in the 1960s, when the founder pledged job opportunities for the African-American community.
S.
12 today.
Fifty years after President Lyndon Johnson visited Kentucky and declared the War on Poverty, the area of Eastern Kentucky continues to struggle with high unemployment rates, poverty, and the loss of thousands of coal-industry jobs.
S.
S.
Wall Street.
On the same day, the Obama administration announced the national deficit has declined to its lowest level since 2007.
Xerox, a $22 billion company, is the first Fortune-500 corporation to have a female CEO.
Its commitment to a diverse workforce began in the 1960s, when the founder pledged job opportunities for the African-American community.
Economics correspondent Paul Solman explores how the effort to include and amplify multiple points of view has helped it survive and adapt to an ever-morphing market.
GWEN IFILL: Next: how a Fortune 500 company changed its approach to corporate diversity, an effort that began more than two decades ago.
Our economics correspondent, Paul Solman, has the story, part of his reporting on Making Sense of financial news.
ACTRESS: I can’t type.
I don’t take dictation.
PAUL SOLMAN: The face of Xerox in the early 1960s, soft-selling the company’s first retail copier.
ACTRESS: My boss calls me indispensable.
ACTOR:  Ms.
Jones?
ACTRESS: Naturally.
PAUL SOLMAN: Xerox has come a long way.
Besides copiers and, increasingly, document services, the CEO is selling something else in this era: diversity.
URSULA BURNS, CEO, Xerox: You have to have as many people who are capable engaged in a solution.
And, if you don’t, then — then, you know, shame on you.
PAUL SOLMAN: A $22 billion company doing business in more than 180 countries with 140,000 employees and hundreds of plants, Xerox has been run by Ursula Burns since 2009.
Her predecessor was also a woman.
ACTRESS: I make perfect copies for whatever my boss needs by just turning a knob and pushing a button.
Well, the drive to diversity began not long after the ad.
In the summer of 1964, amid race riots near Xerox headquarters in Rochester, New York, founder Joe Wilson met with black leaders.
DAMIKA ARNOLD, Global Diversity and Inclusion Manager, Xerox: And found out that the reason why they were rioting is because they didn’t have access to jobs.
So he pledged that the black people of the community would be able to get jobs at Xerox.
PAUL SOLMAN: By 1991, when we first reported on diversity at Xerox, 9 percent of its top managers were black, compared to a national average of just half-a-percent.
The company mandated managers like Kent Amos to fulfill its diversity mission.
KENT AMOS, Xerox: We’re going to trust it, trust you, and empower you to be African-Americans and bring that to the table.
And it worked.
PAUL SOLMAN: In fact, Ursula Burns was recruited by Xerox as part of its summer minority internship program in 1980.
But, she says, affirmative action didn’t extend to gender.
URSULA BURNS: We looked up one day and all the African-American men were doing better.
I mean, they were leaders of the company.
So we said, oh, my God, then we have to do something about women.
PAUL SOLMAN: For instance, why were there so few female plant managers, a key rung up the ladder?
URSULA BURNS: It turns out you have to work the shifts in manufacturing.
You have to be there from 9:00 to whatever the heck it is, 8:00 to 5:00.
And, literally, we would put plant managers in and they would bomb out, women plant managers, primarily because we had zero flexibility.
These things, we would have never, ever, ever figured out until we realized — a woman in there said, we’re not dumb in manufacturing.
We just — we need a lot more flexibility than you’re allowing us to have.
PAUL SOLMAN: And so job sharing, or splitting a full-time position into two part-time jobs, was instituted.
Still, for years, women were more visible than audible, says 40-year Xerox veteran Diane O’Connor.
DIANE O’CONNOR, Vice President, Xerox: I’m almost always the last person to speak up.
Early on in my career, they never would have gotten to me, because the first three or four guys that said, here’s what you have to go do, and they said, yes, we’re going to go do it.
And I’m still sitting in my chair and they have all gone to the men’s room and I’m still sitting there going, oh, well, I guess that’s decided.
PAUL SOLMAN: As a vice president, O’Connor now runs the meetings and is active in the Women’s Alliance, a Xerox-sanctioned independent worker group, which advocates, mentors, networks.
Corporate speed-dating:  Make a contact.
Make a pitch.
WOMAN: Innovative, energetic, results-oriented.
WOMAN: Right now, I manage one account nationally.
PAUL SOLMAN: Five minutes, and it’s on to the next.
WOMAN: OK, that’s time.
PAUL SOLMAN: The Women’s Alliance is one of several caucus groups that promote women at Xerox offices around the country.
There’s also the Black Women’s Leadership Council.
WOMAN: You have goals and aspirations.
People won’t know if you don’t share that.
PAUL SOLMAN: Xerox engineer Marina Tharayil chaired the Women’s Innovation Group, which addresses a common malady, shrinking violet syndrome.
MARINA THARAYIL, Senior Research Scientist, Xerox: I have heard someone say, if it’s gold, it will shine.
It’s not your job to market yourself or to kind of showcase your work, because that’s considered immodest.
PAUL SOLMAN: But it’s not just women helping women.
JEFF JACOBSON, President of Technology, Xerox: You might want to start focusing and saying, what is that ultimate next position and career that I would like to pursue?
PAUL SOLMAN: President of technology Jeff Jacobson at Xerox’s London office.
WOMAN: A natural fit as I think about where I see my career progressing is to lead one of the business group organizations.
P.
Rognee Mehtah  ph  is his protege.
WOMAN: But I wanted to get your feedback on whether you think that that’s too ambitious and what are some of the experiences I would need to accrue in order to be an eligible candidate for one of those roles.
JEFF JACOBSON: So, certainly, never feel anything is too ambitious for you.
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, not every woman needs pumping up.
Paul Allaire, CEO in the 1990s, mentored Ursula Burns.
Appearing on “The History Makers” with host Gwen Ifill, Allaire recalled that Burns was no wallflower.
PAUL ALLAIRE, Former CEO, Xerox: We went through a number of fairly high-level meetings.
And her answer was, I could do this.
She says, I could do this.
I could do your job.
I could be CEO.
PAUL SOLMAN: Now that she is CEO, Burns is one of nine female top executives at Xerox.
More than a quarter of the company’s corporate leaders are women, compared to just 15 percent at other Fortune 500 companies.
And 20 percent of top managers are minorities.
URSULA BURNS: We approach issues from different perspectives, no doubt about it.
If I actually had my leadership team and they were all African-American female from New York City engineer, the conversation would be easy.
PAUL SOLMAN: And you would trust each other implicitly.
URSULA BURNS: And we would trust each other implicitly, and your perspective would be excluding a lot of perspectives.
So we would feel great in the room.
Yes, that was a really efficient meeting, we got it all kind of wrapped up, everything is pretty cool.
We walk out, and our clients are different, our work force is different from that.
It’s just — it wouldn’t be a good business model.
PAUL SOLMAN: Burns thinks diversity actually helped save the company.
Long threatened by digital imaging, Xerox transformed itself, from machine maker to service provider.
E-ZPass, toll collection, and call centers now account for more than half of all revenue.
URSULA BURNS: Is to engage as much difference, as much breadth as you can, because that gives you little peeks into where some of the big opportunities will be.
PAUL SOLMAN: And big ideas from new perspectives.
Moreover, says senior sales vice president Pat Elizondo, diversity in general and women in particular are vital to courting customers for the growing services business.
PAT ELIZONDO, Senior Sales Vice President, Xerox:  Women are better listeners.
It takes patience to truly actively listen and understand and walk away from a client discussion understanding, what are they asking us to give them?
PAUL SOLMAN: As somebody whose profession is to listen, I am taking some umbrage to this comment, I just want you to know.
PAUL SOLMAN: Looking for some reassurance, perhaps, I felt I had to ask Burns, we men aren’t in any danger of becoming obsolete, are we?
URSULA BURNS: Yes, men are useful.
URSULA BURNS: They’re more than useful.
Obviously, we want men in there.
PAUL SOLMAN: Men, women, minorities from around the world.
Xerox has had a gay and lesbian caucus for more than twenty years.
Multiple points of view to adapt to a global, ever-morphing market.
The only thing the company doesn’t have: the stereotypes of the past.
ACTRESS: Here, Mr.
Smith.
I’m going to lunch with mother.

The Silver State Health Insurance Exchange board voted unanimously Tuesday to end its relationship with Xerox, the vendor contracted in 2012 to build the exchange’s Nevada Health Link website.
Nov.
15, though it will keep its status and funding as a state-controlled system.
The exchange will also issue a request for proposals to evaluate replacement systems in coming years.
A new platform could come from a state with a functional marketplace, or from a vendor with a similar, proven program.
As with the final vote, reaction to the board’s decision was uniform.
Insurance brokers, insurers, lawmakers and policymakers all praised the move, which the board considered since February.
Overall, it was positive action by the board.
Certainly, if you look at public testimony, it was hard to find anyone who wanted to stay with Xerox,” said Dwight Mazzone, a Las Vegas broker who serves on the exchange’s consumer affairs committee.
It was an emotionally draining decision.
I commend the board for what they’ve done.
Pat Casale, a broker who participated in an analysis of how to fix the exchange, said the decision is the only reasonable course.
The reality is, I think the board realizes we’ve had enough of the excuses already.
We need results,” Casale said.
For the money we’ve spent, we have no results.
Casale, a long-time Xerox critic, said he is nonetheless “excited” Xerox would stay on until November’s open enrollment period.
It means they’ll finish the job they started for our  clients ,” he said.
We went too long without any noticeable improvement,” he said.
Xerox is a “disaster,” and he supports the board’s decision.
There is no reason Nevada’s exchange couldn’t have been as successful as other state-based exchanges, like Kentucky or Connecticut, if not for Xerox,” Reid stated.
Though observers generally agree a change is needed, uncertainties linger.
It won’t be clear until 2015 just how much it will cost to bring in a new system.
Vendors will have to bid on a contract to serve the exchange.
The second unknown is how much Xerox will be paid.
3 million.
Exchange spokesman CJ Bawden said the state will pay Xerox as the company finishes parts of the website and continues to care for current enrollees through November.
Rep.
Xerox already faces legal action in Texas, where state officials fired the vendor earlier this month.
On May 9 Texas sued the company, alleging it mistakenly reimbursed Medicaid providers for hundreds of millions of dollars in medically unnecessary dental claims.
Gov.
The board’s decision also presents new challenges for the state’s Medicaid system, which needs upgrades to transfer accounts to and from the federal system, and to handle enrollments by phone.
5 million to $2 million — from the state.
The board’s decision concludes a troubled relationship with Xerox, which fell woefully behind schedule on its Nevada Health Link build.
The system debuted on Oct.
1 to hundreds of technical flaws and software glitches, and sign-ups have been held to about a third of the initial enrollment target of 118,000.
Xerox has been unwavering in its commitment to Nevada Health Link and to getting all aspects of the exchange right.
We have engaged the full breadth of Xerox’s resources and have brought in external experts to meet that goal,” Wasmer said.
She also pointed to the “considerable accomplishment” of the exchange in supporting Medicaid expansion in Nevada.
About 190,000 Nevadans are eligible for Medicaid through Nevada Health Link.
More than 10,000 people have also enrolled in private health plans in a special enrollment period that began April 1 and ends May 30.

Texas Medicaid officials, already in a legal battle with Xerox Corp.
Tuesday accusing Xerox of improperly taking large quantities of medical records and not protecting patients’ confidentiality.
The state Health and Human Services Commission said it filed a lawsuit in state district court in Austin seeking return of the patient data.
The commission said it also has filed a notice with federal officials that Xerox “is now out of compliance” with privacy rules under the 1996 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Once again, the reckless and irresponsible actions of this company put Texas tax dollars at risk,” Kyle Janek, the state agency’s executive commissioner, said in a statement.
Lightfoot said a court hearing will be held on the matter next month.
The dispute stems from state allegations that Xerox failed in its duty as the state’s Medicaid claims administrator to stand guard and make sure dentists who wanted to put braces on poor children complied with state Medicaid laws and rules that bar doing such work for cosmetic reasons.
Medicaid is the state-federal health insurance program for the poor, elderly and disabled.
In response to a long-running class action complaint known as the Frew lawsuit, Texas agreed in 2007 to improve preventive dental care for poor children by luring dentists back into the program and making greater efforts to ensure that kids have regular checkups.
Under normal circumstances, the increased volume would increase demand for orthodontic work.
However, commission officials have said Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Services, which Xerox bought in 2010, fell down on the job of requiring proper “prior authorization” consents for expensive braces.
An example of severely misaligned teeth  Photo courtesy of Dr.
The state has said that ACS, though supposed to approve putting braces on children only when misalignment of teeth makes it difficult for a child to breathe or eat, had only lax controls and essentially rubber-stamped dentists’ prior authorization requests.
9 million five years later.
In May, Texas sued Xerox for non-performance and demanded recovery of the misspent money.
The commission cancelled Xerox’s five-year, $759 million claims administration contract about three years early.
On Tuesday, company spokesman Lightfoot emailed a reporter a July 21 court filing that described a tussle over 2 million pages and more than a terrabyte of patient data.
In their motion, the company’s lawyers said the state has rejected Xerox’s proposals for guaranteeing patient privacy and is making unreasonable demands.
Janek, though, said Xerox has overstepped its bounds.
There is a legal process for the company to get any records it needs for the lawsuit, but instead Xerox has chosen to put information of Medicaid clients at risk and force the state to take court action to protect those records,” he said.
Janek said Xerox acknowledged in a July 21 court filing that it removed files from servers and hard drives and allowed lawyers and another company to see the records.
Janek said the commission learned that Xerox “removed 244 boxes of information” before handing off the claims administration work to Accenture earlier this month.
The commission believes the files include client names, photographs, birth dates and medical and billing records, Janek said.
We don’t know anything about the security of the servers now housing the information, staff training, background checks, nothing,” he said.
However, Xerox insisted it needs the records to defend itself.
It referred to a June 2012 civil investigative demand made of it by Attorney General Greg Abbott’s office.
With full knowledge by the state, Xerox said it “has had, for the past two years, full and unfettered access” to the records the state now is demanding, according to the motion filed by the company’s lawyers with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Dallas and the Beck Redden LLP law firm in Austin.

Business Adventures, by John Brooks, is the best business book I’ve ever read.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to find.
The book went out of print in the early 1970s.
The original publisher is out of business, and Brooks died in 1993.
But his family kindly agreed to provide one chapter as a free e-book, which you can download below.
Xerox Xerox Xerox Xerox,” which originally appeared in the April 1, 1967 issue of The New Yorker, demonstrates all the strengths that made Brooks such a special writer: his intellect, his ability to see the big picture, and his sense of humor.
In addition to this free chapter, the full version of Business Adventures was recently released by a new publisher as an e-book.
You can buy it at many retailers’ websites.
As I wrote in my full review , Warren Buffett first recommended this book to me in 1991, shortly after we first met.

It is fairly well accepted that the Xerox Alto is where the world of GUIs all began.
Now you can relive the Alto experience for yourself with SALTO, the Xerox Alto Simulator!
SALTO is kind of buggy.
The cursor shakes, video gets corrupted, applications crash, you can not permanently save changes to disk, and ethernet is not implemented.
But it is enough to start up some of the applications and see what it was all about.
The Xerox Alto and the included applications represent the early exploration, research, successes, and mistakes of GUI UI concepts.
The included disk images start up to the Alto Executive.
The Executive is a command line interpreter used for file management and executing programs.
It is similar to the DOS command interpreter.
Several versions of the Executive are included on the disk images: Executive 7 dated October 14, 1976, Executive 11 dated June 26, 1980, and Executive 12 dated January 8, 1983.
Input and output only occur in a 16-line  window  at the top of the screen.
NOT case sensitive!
Can use wildcards to refer to files.
For example  *.run?  lists all runable program files.
The Alto is a single tasking environment, and applications take complete control of the system and the screen when you run them.
Again, this is similar to running graphical applications under DOS.
The emulator needs a host display greater than 800 pixels high to fit the Alto s 606*808 display.
Just to show how far we have not come, many  modern  displays can not quite handle that.
This is Neptune, the Alto file manager.
Using the mouse you can select different drives or directories, select or unselect individual files, and initiate an action by clicking the  start  button.
A  start  button?
The interesting thing about Neptune is that it exclusively uses the mouse to perform all actions.
This is in contrast to other Alto programs that only use the mouse to point, but then require you to press a command key on the keyboard to initiate an action.
There is a scroll bar of sorts on the left of each file list.
The  bar  is not visibly drawn, but clicking in this area scrolls the list.
The mouse cursor changes shape when it hovers over this area, and each of the three mouse buttons are used to perform different scrolling actions.
You can also view or  type  a text file within Neptune.
Bravo is the Alto s word processor.
It was the first  What You See Is What You Get  word processing system.
Text is formatted on the screen as it would be on a printer.
This includes different fonts, font sizes, super subsubscript, bold, italics, and more.
And changes to the document are immediately applied on the screen.
Although the output functionality was revolutionary, the input functionality was similar to other editors of the time.
Unlike modern editors, you don t just start typing.
Instead you have to type a command from the keyboard.
There are no menus of any kind.
For a list of available commands you must read the manual.
In Bravo, the mouse is mostly used for selecting text.
Similar to Neptune, there is an invisible scroll bar at the left of the screen that you can use with the mouse to scroll the text area.
Draw is a vector based drawing program.
Instead of a bit-mapped imaged, draw images consist of connected points with properties.
You can copy, stretch, and transform each object independently.
Draw has a visible tool pallet along the left side of the screen.
You can click on any item to select a brush or tool.
Similar to Bravo, Draw does not have a visible command menu for its additional functions  such as opening a file .
You must use the keyboard instead.
Inconsistently, Draw uses Control key combinations.
Again, read the manual to find out what the keys are.
Markup is a bit-mapped drawing program.
The available drawing tools are geared toward document illustration.
Unlike the other applications, all commands are done from a pop up menu invoked by clicking the middle mouse button.
The pop up menu is kind of weird.
It start by showing just one line of the menu, and expands as you move the mouse around.
Very awkward if you don t know that a menu item is supposed to be there.
To show  quit  you must move the mouse slightly past where it will appear.
The  +  on the right adds a page.
Selectable page numbers appear at the left or right if present.
Note that running under SALTO, Markup is very crashy.
Alto.
On a network, an Alto user could send and receive e-mail from other users through a centralized mail server.
Since there is no mail server or ethernet in SALTO, I have loaded a tutorial mail file.
Several interesting user interface features: Text items act as command buttons that you can click on, and the toolbar commandbars expand and contract if they prompt for additional information.

When everyone thinks you re  just a copier company,  you have to work extra hard to redefine your mission and brand.
A lesson from Xerox’s Innovation Group in granting permission to dream.
Call it the curse of the eponym.
May it be a problem your company is so fortunate to have: such wild, early success that your brand name becomes a word applying to the category you’ve created or owned.
And so we “Google” things when we want to search for them online; we pass the “Kleenex” when the tissue might be generic; and of course we “Xerox” pages when in fact we’re using an HP photocopier.
The brand name becomes an “ eponym ,” in linguistic parlance--something that makes a stamp on the English language itself.
Sophie Vandebroek, the CTO of Xerox , has had plenty of time to mull the double-edged effects of being an eponym.
Because today, Xerox does far more than make copiers.
It’s an enterprise giant whose revenues come nearly as much from services  analytics, consulting, and the like  as from actual technology.
But when Vandebroek went to an MIT career fair a few years ago, she was surprised to see long lines at the booths for IBM and Google, but hardly a trickle to her Xerox booth.
She asked one of the students why.
Oh, you just make copiers,” said the student.
They had no clue about all the other businesses,” muses Vandebroek.
It made all the difference.
What Vandebroek does, specifically, is head up Xerox’s Innovation Group, a post she’s held since 2006.
And for the average person peering over Vandebroek’s shoulder during the course of a day at Xerox, you might be surprised to see the kind of creativity-fostering that we more commonly associate with small startups or “sexier” tech companies like Google.
Take, for instance, one of Xerox’s recent educational products: something called Ignite .
Put simply, Ignite is a system combining hardware and software that helps teachers bring personalized education to their students.
A teacher can hand out a quiz on fractions to an entire class, say, and then scan the completed quizzes into Ignite.
Ignite then crunches the numbers to help the teacher go beyond the fact that Johnny got a C while Sally got a B; it can specifically direct the teacher to note that Johnny lags on multiplication while Sally lags on division, and to store all this information in a dashboard for easy, ongoing reference.
Teachers using the system say for the first time they can see--at a glance--what a student needs,” Xerox scientist Eric Hamby said upon the product’s release.
The system is poised to expand into Latin American countries soon.
A Xerox researcher works together with an educator.
How exactly does Xerox get creative about imagining new education products and services?
There are a few crucial steps and ingredients, says Vandebroek.
First, Xerox employs ethnographic researchers to go into the “field”--in this case, a classroom--to directly observe how teachers work and how they might work more efficiently.
Second, Xerox engages in what Vandebroek calls “dreaming sessions” with its clients.
These are unstructured, blue-sky rap sessions designed to get Xerox and its clients to think more creatively about problems and solutions.
A generation ago, a meeting with a client in the educational sector might result in a simple request: Give us faster, cheaper printers.
But they didn’t talk about a printer which could automatically extract the data from a task, then give teachers insight into the specific problems the children have.
To get there, you need to “dream together,” as Vandebroek puts it--to do deep-dive interviews, to really explore a customer’s pain points, and to think creatively and collaboratively about solutions.
There’s one other thing that’s crucial to getting the best, most innovative work out of Xerox employees.
Having fun is one of the principles I always talk with new hires about,” says  Vandebroek.
She goes on: “Being innovative to me is being both creative and entrepreneurial.
And you can’t be creative and entrepreneurial unless you truly bring your heart to work, and have fun at work.
Having fun is really essential.

Friendly Roomba-like robot scrambles to deliver documents to your desk.
Japan’s Fuji Xerox Company unleashed an automated roving robot printer on an unsuspecting office building in Tokyo over the summer.
It’s definitely no giant beweaponed Gundam, but the robot does include a Xerox color laserjet printer mounted on a set of LIDAR sensors which it uses to build a map of the room it s in and to avoid obstacles while navigating.
To summon the printing robot, users access a webpage unique to their seating location, denoted by a card at each desk.
Users drag the document to be printed into the browser window, and the printing robot begins to roll happily in their direction.
Once the printer arrives at the desk, the user holds up the desk’s card to be scanned by the robot, which then prints your document.
Once the robot has done its job and produced the document, tap a button on its top and it rolls away to service the next job in queue—or scurries back to its home location to await the next print job.
The batteries in the unit are said to last up to a full day.
Unfortunately for those eager to equip their homes with robots with frickin’ lasers on their heads—laser printers, at least—the Fuji Xerox prototype is just that: a prototype.
Fuji Xerox doesn’t appear to have any plans to actually release the product; IDC analyst Brian Ma even goes so far as to call it  technology for technology’s sake.  However, the appeal of having a robot deliver documents directly to you is hard to deny, especially in public areas like hotel business centers and airport lounges.

Though it s hard to imagine now, Xerox  NYSE: XRX        was once one of America s hottest stocks.
The machines that made  Xerox  synonymous with copying minted a phalanx of Xerox millionaires in the 1960s , but the company s shares plummeted as that era s optimism gave way to stagflation and oil price shocks.
Over the past four decades  with the exception of a dot-com era surge that, despite its notable peak on the chart below, actually underperformed relative to many other tech companies  Xerox s beleaguered shareholders have seen virtually no growth.

But there is hope.
In the past year, Xerox has gained 30% as investors have slowly realized that this dirt cheap stock is no longer tied to a straightforward copy-machine maker.
Can Xerox keep rising and rewarding its loyal shareholders into 2015 and beyond?
It s certainly possible, but it s better to invest in facts than flights of fancy.
With that in mind, here are three of the biggest reasons why Xerox might continue to post market-beating gains in the future.
Sources: Xerox annual reports.
Numbers do not add up to 100% due to revenue recorded in  other  segment.
Technology refers to all hardware, supplies, and services relating to document copying.
2009 results do not include acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services.
9% in 2013.
The company has been gobbling up a number of smaller service companies since its big buy in 2010, with four acquired in 2013 and two announced so far through 2014.
Most of these acquisitions are of companies headquartered in other countries, which will help further globalize Xerox s revenue base.
In its latest quarter, Xerox s services segment made up 57% of total revenue, and CEO Ursula Burns noted that the company is on track to generate two-thirds of its revenue from services by 2017.
Contrast that with the company s technology segment, which has actually seen its revenues shrink in each of the past three fiscal years, and you get a picture of a company transitioning toward a business model that more closely resembles the model IBM   NYSE: IBM        follows today than what IBM followed in the mid-1990s.
This comparison is apt, because Xerox has been making a conscious effort to emulate IBM s services-first strategy over the past few years.
IBM languished throughout the 90s, but its decision to divest low-margin hardware business to focus on services has paid off.
Since it installed turnaround whiz Lou Gerstner at the helm in 1993, IBM s earnings and share price have soared, with shares up more than 1,200% in the past decade as EPS has risen over 2,500% from a brief but abysmal stretch of losses in the early 90s.
We looked at IBM primarily because its transformation, while different in the specifics, was very similar in the general theme -- going from hardware and technology offerings only to expanding to higher engagement with clients.
We had to be clear about what we were moving from and to.
We had to make sure that we weren t running away from something that we could do well to something that we weren t sure that we could do well.
Xerox has gone so far as to appoint IBM veterans to key executive roles -- Robert Zapafel, IBM s former head of strategy, is now in charge of Xerox s services segment, and former IBM global business services VP John Kennedy  is now the company s CMO.
Xerox is far from alone in its shift toward services, but the services it focuses on have not been flooded by other well-capitalized hardware companies.
Xerox s contract renewal rate was 92% for the two sub-segments it tracked in its last fiscal year, driven by a focus on health care, a $2 billion business for Xerox that serves government agencies, health care providers, employers, and pharmaceutical companies.
Xerox is well-positioned to capitalize as Obamacare expands its reach, since the company notes that it serves 37 states and two-thirds of all insured patients in the United States.
Xerox is legendary for its technological breakthroughs, but it s been more notable for letting trillion-dollar innovations slip through its grasp than it has been for capitalizing on emerging trends.
Take the PC, which was first developed at Xerox s PARC labs before both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made off with the idea and made billions in the process.
PARC s Alto, the first PC.
That legacy of missed opportunities haunts Xerox today, and the company is making sure that it doesn t make similar mistakes again.
Last year, Xerox was granted 1,013 patents, placing 32nd out of all companies that earned any patents in the United States in 2013.
The company has earned at least 500 patents every year since 2008, and 2013 was the second year in a row it obtained at least 1,000 new patents.
But patents alone don t mean much if Xerox isn t developing technologies the future needs.
PARC has announced a number of breakthroughs and developmental efforts in the past few years, including printed flexible electronic chiplets , printable lithium-ion batteries, extreme-temperature sensors, and  vanishing electronics,  which could be very useful in military and privacy applications.
Printable electronic circuitry in particular holds incredible promise, as it could be paired with 3-D printers to create a vast array of functional and fully customizable smart products.
PARC has estimated that this field could be worth $45 billion by 2016, and a mere 10% slice of that pie would boost Xerox s annual revenue by 21% over current levels.
Three good reasons?
Xerox shareholders have waited a long time to see signs of life in this stock.
The past year has been one of Xerox s best this century, but if the reasons I ve highlighted here hold true, 2014 could be only the starting point for a long-term Xerox revival.
Do you think Xerox has a chance to succeed for years to come?
No stock is perfect, but for many shareholders, Xerox s turnaround has been the right move at the right time.

Welcome!
After decades of sub-par performance, Xerox  NYSE: XRX        has given investors a pleasant surprise over the past year as its shares have risen roughly 30%.
Yet Wall Street s analysts have been unimpressed lately, as more rate the stock a Hold than a Buy, with two analysts downgrading it to that status in the past year alone.
Are they wrong?
I recently took a look at several reasons why Xerox might be on its way up , but it s important to consider both sides of the coin before diving into a stock.
Today, we ll take a look at a few reasons why Xerox s strong performance might soon come to an end.
Since the start of 2013, Xerox s shares have nearly doubled.
This situation is hardly unique to Xerox, as many of its peers on the S&P 500  SNPINDEX: ^GSPC        have seen shares soar largely because of investor optimism rather than because earnings have been on the upswing.
However, most S&P 500 companies have put together solid earnings growth, as the aggregate EPS growth rate for all 500 companies is nearly 17% since the start of 2013.
Underperforming the index on a fundamental basis is not likely to result in long-term share-price outperformance.
Xerox does have low valuations in its favor, as its P E ratio is currently 22% lower than the overall S&P 500.
But if its shares continue to grow without a corresponding growth in earnings, that will soon change -- Xerox s P E has nearly doubled since the start of 2013, but the S&P s is up by a mere 13%.
As I pointed out in a more bullish review , Xerox has successfully transitioned from a hardware-focused company to one that generates most of its revenue from services.
Sources: Xerox annual reports.
Xerox executives have warned that margins will likely be weaker for the near term, a problem they ve blamed recently on sales in the government health care business, which has been problematic on a profit basis for many companies serving this gargantuan sector of the American economy.
8% for the services segment looks to continue a multiyear slide.
If revenues in the company s technology segment continue to decline at mid-single-digit rates  revenue was down 1% in 2011, 8% in 2012, and 6% in 2013 , services could very well account for two-thirds of total revenue by 2017, as projected.
8% this year, which will rise to 8% next year.
8%.
Xerox has taken on a large number of government contracts as it transitions toward becoming a fully services-focused company.
Providing services to governmental healthcare organizations now accounts for 7% of overall revenue, and the loss of any one contract can have an outsized impact on company momentum.
5% of total revenue, according to Nelson Hall analyst Rachael Stormonth.

Three good reasons?
Xerox s bears have not managed to swat down the stock s bullish charge just yet, but that doesn t mean that its good times will continue forever.
These three problems could undo Xerox s gains, but only if the market decides that they pose a threat so grave that the company s strengths can t overcome them.
Will these reasons be enough for you to stay away today, or does Xerox have too much in its favor to be kept down for the long term?

Online customer support agents aren’t always human these days, and that’s generally frustrating for customers.
But Xerox’s WDS division is announcing a customer support technology today with what it says is a higher level of artificial intelligence.
The WDS Virtual Agent taps into intelligence gleaned from terabytes of data that the company keeps about real customer interactions.
Armed with this info, the virtual agent can more reliably solve problems itself, as it learns through experience.
The more customer care data it is exposed to, the more effective it becomes in delivering relevant responses to real customer questions.
Of course, AI proponents have been saying this for decades, so the proof will be in how well it works.
It may be a long time before we get virtual AI companions like in the movie Her , where actor Joaquin Phoenix’s character falls in love with Siri-like AI.
But virtual assistants are becoming popular because, Xerox says, they cost about a fiftieth of what a human being costs.
Xerox has applied its research from its PARC  formerly Palo Alto Research Center  and Xerox Research Centre Europe in AI, machine learning, and natural language processing.
The AI can understand, diagnose, and solve customer problems — without being specifically programmed to give rote responses.
It analyzes and learns from human agents.
Because many first-generation virtual agents rely on basic keyword searches, they aren’t able to understand the context of a customer’s question like a human agent can,” said WDS’ Nick Gyles, chief technology officer, in a statement.
The WDS Virtual Agent has the confidence to solve problems itself because it learns just like we do, through experience.
Xerox captures data like customer sentiment, described symptoms, problem types, root causes, and the techniques agents use to resolve customer problems.
The data have been there for a while; it just needs AI that is smart enough to absorb it all.
We’ve found a way for organizations to unlock that data potential to deliver benefit across their wider care channels,” Gyles said.
Xerox is delivering the WDS Virtual Agent as a cloud-based solution.
It will be available in the fourth quarter.
Our technology helps overcome one of the key barriers brands face in trying to deliver a truly omni-channel care experience; the ability to be consistent.
Digital care tools often lag behind the intelligence that resides in the contact center, with outdated content or no awareness of new problems.
Our research in artificial intelligence is changing this,” said  Jean-Michel Renders , senior scientist at XRCE in a statement.

From now until October, Xerox said it will be adding 500 new positions at its Cherry Hill facility.
The job openings are for customer care representatives for Xeroxâ€™s annual benefits enrollment program.
The company said itâ€™s looking for applicants with previous customer service experience.
Xerox spokeswoman Jennifer Levinton said.
She added that several other locations across the United States are hiring for the same positions.
The jobs, which will add to Xeroxâ€™s 759 Cherry Hill employees, are temporary, project-based positions, with the potential to move to regular employment, a press release noted.
In-person applications will be accepted at a job fair Sept.
101 Woodcrest Road in Cherry Hill.

The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services has filed a claim against the private company responsible for rolling out a Medicaid payment system that the state says is riddled with defects.
In the claim filed Monday, the health department said Xerox State Healthcare LLC breached its contract after it failed to implement the multimillion-dollar software system within the timeframe agreed upon.
Once the system did go live in October 2013, it failed to issue timely and accurate payments to Alaska health care providers, the claim said.
Xerox State Healthcare is a subsidiary of Xerox Corp.
According to Health and Social Services Commissioner William Streur, the system is paying some providers too much, some too little and some not at all.
In its claim filed with the Alaska Department of Administration, the state health department has demanded that Xerox produce an extensive corrective action plan to remedy the broken system.
7 million in liquidated damages.
Medicaid systems are some of the most complex projects undertaken by a state or by a health IT vendor,” she wrote.
As with any major technological implementation, they have settling-in periods.
Xerox’s web-based Medicaid Management Information System is used in both Alaska and New Hampshire “and is rolling out in other states now,” Wasmer wrote.
In New Hampshire , agencies complained in September 2013 that the Xerox system had resulted in $10 million in payment backlog.
Texas filed a lawsuit against Xerox in May to reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars it said the company erroneously gave out in Medicaid claims, according to local news reports.
The Alaska project dates back to 2007, when Affiliated Computer Services won the bid to replace the state’s 27-year-old Medicaid payment system, which covers the bills for eligible, low-income Alaskans.
The system no longer met government standards, and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services agreed to fund 90 percent of the cost to upgrade it, Streur said.
Each milestone was tied to a payment amount and completion date, according to the claim.
ACS had two years and eight months to design, develop and implement the new system under the contract, but it did not meet that deadline, the claim said.
In February 2010, Xerox acquired the company, Wasmer wrote.
While the old system continued to handle providers’ Medicaid claims, scheduled completion dates for the new system kept passing with little progress.
The state health department set a “go live” date for June 1, 2010, then extended it several times, eventually approving a revised date of Oct.
1, 2012, according to the claim.
Without state approval, Xerox then “unilaterally and on more than one occasion extended the ‘go live’ date,” the claim said.
By Oct.
1, 2013, Xerox had identified 44 defects with the system but said there were “workarounds” for all of them.
On that day, the new system went online and within weeks the number of defects grew to 546.
Everything started to implode and providers started to call, saying, ‘Not only didn’t they pay my claim but they took back money from last year,’ ” said Streur.
5 million in funding from Xerox for three uncompleted milestones including testing, acceptance test and implementation, the claim said.
Over the past year, however, the new system has not operated at maximum efficiency, creating a backlog.
On July 29, the state recorded 89,421 suspended Medicaid claims.
A state employee went to Xerox’s mailroom in Anchorage and found “hundreds of thousands of neatly stacked paper claims,” according to the claim.
Wasmer wrote that the claims backlog has dropped by more than 63 percent since the beginning of June and referred to the state questions about specific numbers of claims pending.
Streur disputed that percentage.
We really don’t know the extent of the problem yet, and that’s what’s concerning to me,” he said.
Charlie Franz, administrator of Heritage Place in Soldotna, said the nursing facility has seen its daily revenues drop significantly since the new system went into use.
At the 60-bed facility, about 85 percent of patients are covered by Medicaid, he said.
Before the new system went live the facility’s books were short $570,000 in August 2013.
By July of the following year, that amount jumped to more than $1 million.
When the facility filed Medicaid claims, Franz said, it would get lengthy billing messages from the system, some 75 to 80 pages long.
These things were impossible, and I’ve been doing this for 42 years,” he said.
He said payments have gotten better.
In August, the facility received a lump of $574,000 in Medicaid money.
But glitches persist in other types of claims.
Foolishly, they turned off the old system, and that was a major mistake,” he said.
I can’t believe that whoever was in charge of doing that made that stupid decision.
At LaTouche Pediatrics in Anchorage, business manager Angi Titus said the medical group s unpaid Medicaid and Denali KidCare claims amount to tens of thousands of dollars.
They got pretty far behind in processing claims and handling appeals.
It really slows down the revenue dramatically for quite a long period of time,” she said.
Cori Mills, a Department of Law spokesperson, said the state’s claim will be referred to an administrative law judge.
A hearing date has yet to be set.

When Barclays cut its rating of Xerox Corp.
NYSE: XRX  to Underweight from Equal Weight, just after the company reported 2013 earnings a few weeks ago, the bank’s research arm expressed anxiety about the cost of more restructurings at the failed tech firm.
The problem is actually worse than that.
Xerox management, particularly long-serving CEO Ursula Burns, has run out of cost-cutting tricks.
Xerox has not grown for several years, and there are very few who follow the company closely who believe it can grow going forward.
The only solution the Xerox board has, if there is one, is to bring in executives from outside the culture, which has been dominated by long-serving board members and top management.
Burns has done an excellent job keeping herself visible in the business and media worlds since becoming CEO in 2009, after the retirement of mentor Anne Mulcahy.
Burns sits on the Forbes 100 World’s Most Powerful Women’s list, as well as the Fortune global list of the Most Powerful Women in Business.
She also spends a great deal of time outside Xerox, sitting on other corporate boards, including American Express Co.
NYSE: AXP  and Exxon Mobil Corp.
NYSE: XOM .
Each of these board memberships pays her well.
They do, however, keep her away from time that might be spent on her troubled company.
Her visibility, both through public appearances and outside board meetings, has not done anything for shareholders.
4 billion buyout of Affiliated Computer Services, which closed in early 2010, as a means to diversify the parent company, thereby improving its chances for revenue growth.
The money was wasted.
Burns’s recent letter to shareholders showed just how badly the transaction had gone.
Over the course of 2010 to 2013, revenue, net income and operating margins are flat to down.
4 billion in 2013.
7 billion.
2 billion last year.
In the fourth quarter, the drop was 4% to $311 million.
Xerox management and its board made two other notable announcements with the release of 2013 data.
The first is that the financial figures for 2014 may not be any better than in 2013, as measured by GAAP EPS.
25 cents a share.
What the 2013 Xerox financial report made clear is that the company has gone from a troubled, no-growth maker of low-end hardware technology to a troubled provider of no-growth business services as well.
Affiliated Computer Services has done nothing to improve Xerox’s fortunes.
Aside from poor financial results and her public visibility, one other thing is sure about Burns’s recent tenure.
The Xerox board has made her extravagantly wealthy.
Burns made an average of $13 million a year from 2010 to 2012.
Wall Street will carefully watch whether she does anywhere close to that for 2013 and wonder if, in the event that she is paid well again, how it could have happened.
Burns is fortunate.
She has a friendly board.
Most of its members have been on long enough to have elected Burns as chairman  May 2010, after becoming CEO in July 2009 .
The Xerox board is notable for being manned by two high-profile CEOs who were pushed out by their own boards due to poor performance — Charles Prince, formerly of Citigroup Inc.
NYSE: C , and Robert A.
McDonald, formerly of Procter & Gamble Co.
NYSE: PG .
Members also include the retired head of the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa and the Executive Director of the Center for Adoption Policy.
Finally, Burns’s visibility, the nature of the Xerox board and the terribly disappointing financial results are not the only measure of her performance.
Shares of Xerox are up about 50% since Burns became CEO.
The S&P is higher by nearly 100% over the same period.
Burns may get another tremendous pay day, but the Xerox board will be under pressure to make it her last one.

There were no reports of trouble at the company after they laid off the employees from its call center operation.
Today we told employees and local government that we were closing call center operations for one specific line of business at our facility in Cary,  said Bill McKee with  Xerox s public relations department.  These reductions, while very difficult decisions, reflect the changing business requirements of our clients.
The company said the center serves various other businesses, and they hope to find work for the employees with other business their company serves.
McKee said.
However, one employee who was laid off Friday told ABC11 that it was a shock, and the timing was awful with Christmas coming up.
It s terrible timing, I mean Christmas is right around the corner.

It is the second round of layoffs at Xerox s call center.
In October, the company announced it would lose one-third of the work force at the center and cut about 500 jobs.
Friday s layoffs were a part of the 500 positions eliminated at the company, according to McKee.
Xerox currently has 1,800 employees in Cary.

Xerox       Alumni Association was originally founded as the Xerox-X Association in       1983.
It is a non-profit organization of former Xerox employees who missed       the camaraderie, intellectual stimulation and friendship that the       community of Xerox offered.
The       founders of Xerox-X Association believed that they worked at a special       company and that they contributed to creating one of America’s greatest       business success stories.
It was       a work climate that teemed with bright, energetic people who inspired each       other to perform beyond what seemed possible and now the Xerox Alumni       Association exists to sustain and value that spirit.
Networking           - Membership in Xerox Alumni Association will enhance reconnection           which is very beneficial during any transition whether retirement,           relocation, job change or starting a business.

From Xerox, a lesson for Apple and others to copy — and not copy.
What great technological innovation had its public debut 55 years ago this week?
As high-tech devices go, the folks at Apple and the rest have yet to introduce anything quite as hot as the one first shown to the public in a televised demonstration 55 years ago this week.
The Xerox 914, the first of what we would come to know as the modern office plain-paper photocopier, changed the world in ways large and small.
Two were on site for the big TV presentation at New York s Sherry-Netherland hotel and, it s said, one caught fire.
Jammed paper overheating was a problem common enough that fire extinguishers — the Xerox marketing department insisted on dubbing them  scorch eliminators  — became standard issue with the early units.
But the copiers moved briskly, just the same, touching many aspects of everyday  life in their wake.
No matter how good the copies, what s original matters more.
The Xerox 914 is part of an innovation chain that runs through Apple Watch and myriad other high-tech products put before the public with as much fanfare as can be mustered.
Like so many of those newer gadgets, the Xerox 914 liberated content and empowered its users.
It s not clear that the first September 1959 demonstration gave any real hint of how popular, how prevalent and how much a catalyst for disruption it would be.
Also supposedly not clear, on TV anyway, was the copy the 914 produced, though it s tough to know for sure because there doesn t seem to be a lot of news coverage of the event to check.
There s not even agreement on the actual date, with several sources suggesting the anniversary will be Tuesday while Xerox itself pins the date as Friday.
Undisputed, as thousands of clients soon saw, is that the machines could in fact churn out near identical copies on whatever kind of paper a user wanted more quickly, cleanly and easily than anything before it.
The first 914 sold, bulky and tipping the scales at 648 pounds, and was delivered and uncrated in March 1960.
The last would roll off the production line in 1976, and the pioneering model would be enshrined in the Smithsonian Institution nine years after that.
Its impact can be seen in everything from pop art to office clutter.
If authors and publishers worry today about the ability of individuals to collect, aggregate and redistribute proprietary material, that concern began to coalesce with the introduction of the Xerox 914.
At the time of the Xerox 914 s star turn at the Sherry-Netherland, there were other copiers on the market from companies such as 3M, Kodak and even Xerox, many smaller and less expensive.
But they required special paper and special handling.
Copies came out wet, weren t necessarily permanent and not all shades necessarily registered in reproduction.
Carbon paper was a copying option, and so was retyping a document.
But here was an easier way.
But copies only got Xerox so far, and therein is a lesson.
Much was expected of Xerox when the 914 was driving exponential growth in sales.
Part of that problem was its success was so rapid, the company had its hands full satisfying demand for what it already did.
And so it put out new models of copiers.
But other companies, both in the United States and abroad, would develop their own copiers in time, and while Xerox expanded into far-flung businesses such as insurance, its computer efforts floundered.
The company s famed Palo Alto Research Center, known as PARC in Silicon Valley lore, was established in anticipation of a day when people would look at screens rather than paper and was responsible for some truly remarkable technological breakthroughs.
Unfortunately for Xerox, many of those advances and the people responsible for them would prove more valued at Microsoft, IBM, Apple and other companies.
The PARC team developed the Xerox Alto, a forward-thinking 1973 desktop personal computer prototype that the company never took to market.
The Alto linked through a network to other personal computers, and what was seen on its screen was precisely what was printed out.
But what struck 24-year-old Steve Jobs when he was invited to visit PARC in 1979 was something called graphic-user interface.
That s what enables users to point and click on an on-screen icon, and in this case, it was directed by what s known as a mouse.
They d done a bunch of things wrong.
But we didn t know that at the time.
Xerox corporate bosses —  Toner Heads  to the crew at PARC — were so focused on the copier sales and marketing that they lost sight of the product development and innovation that gave the company the 914 in the first place.
Product people get driven out of decision-making forums,  Jobs said.  So the product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies who have no conception of a good product vs.
These Toner Heads would come out to Xerox PARC and have no clue what they were seeing,  he said.  They just grabbed defeat from the greatest victory in the computer industry.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been the IBM of the  90s.
It could have been the Microsoft of the  90s.
But that s all ancient history.
Except as a reminder that even the hottest things grow cold.

The Xerox Star has had a significant impact upon the computer industry.
In this retrospective, several of Star s designers describe how Star was and is unique, its historical antecedents, how it was designed and developed, how it has evolved since its introduction, and, finally, some lessons learned.
In April of 1981, Xerox introduced the 8010  Star  Information System.
Star s introduction was an important event in the history of personal computing because it changed notions of how interactive systems should be designed.
Several of Star s designers, some of whom were responsible for the original design and others of whom designed recent improvements, describe in this article where Star came from, what is distinctive about it, and how the original design has changed.
In doing so, we hope to correct some misconceptions about Star that we have seen expressed in the trade press, and to relate some of what we have learned from the experience of designing it.
In this article, the name  Star  usually refers to both Star and its successor, ViewPoint.
We begin by describing Star as a static system: stating what Star was intended to be and by listing and discussing the aspects that made -- and in some cases still make -- it unique.
Following that, we describe how Star came about and how it has changed since its introduction.
Finally, we discuss what we have learned from the experience of designing and building Star.
Star was designed as an office automation system.
The idea was that professionals in a business or organization would have workstations on their desks and would use them to produce, retrieve, distribute, and organize documentation, presentations, memos, and reports.
All of the workstations in an organization would be connected via Ethernet and would share access to file servers, printers, etc.
Star s designers assumed that the target users are interested in getting their work done and not at all interested in computers.
Therefore, an important design goal was to make the  computer  as invisible to users as possible.
The applications included in the system were those that office professionals would supposedly need: documents, business graphics, tables, personal data-base, and electronic mail.
The set was fixed, always loaded, and automatically associated with data files, eliminating the need for users to worry about obtaining, installing, and starting the right application for a given task or data file.
Users could focus on their work, oblivious of concepts like software, operating systems, applications, and programs.
Another important assumption was that Star s users would be casual, occasional users, rather than people who spent most of their time at the machine.
This assumption led to the goal of having Star be easy to learn and remember.
When Star was first introduced in 1981, its bitmapped screen, windows, mouse-driven interface, and icons were unique in the marketplace.
They were readily-apparent features that clearly distinguished it from other computers.
Soon, however, these features were adopted by others.
Today, windows, mice, and icons are more common.
However, Star s clean, consistent user interface has much more to do with its details than with its gross features.
We list here the features that we think make Star what it is, categorized according to their level in the system architecture, the levels being: machine and network, window and file manager, user-interface, and document editor.
Distributed, personal computing -- Though ViewPoint is available in a stand-alone configuration, Star and ViewPoint were designed primarily to operate in a distributed computing environment.
This approach combines the advantages and avoids the disadvantages of the two other primary approaches to interactive computing: time-shared systems and stand-alone personal computers.
Time-shared systems, dominant through the Sixties and Seventies, allow expensive resources like printers and large data stores to be shared by many users and help assure the consistency of data that must be used by many.
The disadvantages of timesharing are that all users are dependent upon the continued functioning of the central computer and that system response degrades as the number of users increases.
Personal computers, which have replaced timesharing as the primary mode of interactive computing, have the advantage, as one Xerox PARC researcher put it,  of not being faster at night.  Also, a collection of personal computers is more reliable than are terminals connected to a centralized computer: system problems are less apt to cause a total stoppage of work.
The disadvantages of PCs, of course, are the converse of the advantages of timesharing: Companies that use stand-alone PCs usually see a proliferation of printers, inconsistent data-bases, and non-exchangeable data.
Mouse -- An interactive computer system must provide a way for users to indicate which operations they want and what data they want those operations to be performed on.
As video display terminals became common, it became clear that it was often better for users to specify operands -- and sometimes operations -- by pointing to them on the screen.
It also became clear that graphic applications should not be controlled solely via a keyboard.
In the Sixties and Seventies, many different pointing devices were invented and tried: the light pen, the track ball, the joy stick, cursor keys, the digitizing tablet, the touch-screen, and the mouse.
Like other pointing devices, the mouse allows easy selection of objects and triggering of sensitive areas on the screen.
The mouse differs from touch screens, light pens, and digitizing pads in that it is a relative pointing device: the movement of the pointer on the screen depends upon mouse movement, rather than upon its position.
Unlike light pens, joy sticks, and digitizing pads, the mouse  and the corresponding pointer on the screen  stays put when the user lets go of it to do something else.
To achieve satisfactory mouse-tracking performance, the mouse is handled in at a very low level.
In some workstations, mouse-tracking is handled in the window system, with the result that the mouse pointer often jerks around the screen as and may even freeze for seconds at a time, depending upon what else the system is doing.
The mouse is a hand-eye-coordination device, so if the pointer lags, users just keep moving the mouse, and when the system catches up, the mouse moves beyond the user s target.
This was considered unacceptable at Xerox.
Star uses a two-button mouse, in contrast with the one-button mouse used by Apple and the three-button mouse used by most other vendors.
Though predecessors of Star developed at Xerox PARC  see History of Star Development, below  use a three-button mouse, Star s designers wanted to reduce the number of buttons to alleviate confusion over which button did what.
The functions invoked via the Alto s middle button are, in Star, invoked in other ways.
Why did Star s designers stop at two buttons instead of reducing the number to one, as Apple did?
Because studies they did involving users editing text and other material showed that a one-button mouse eliminated button-confusion errors only at the cost of increasing selection errors to unacceptable levels.
Bit-mapped display -- Until recently, most video display terminals were character-mapped.
Such displays enable vast savings in diaplay memory, which, when memory was expensive, made terminals more affordable.
In the Seventies, researchers at Xerox PARC decided that memory would get cheaper eventually and that a bit-mapped screen was worth the cost anyway.
5 inches tall.
Like the Alto, Star s display has a resolution of 72 pixels per inch.
There are two reasons why the number 72 was chosen.
First, there are 72 printer s points inch, so 72 pixels inch allows for a smooth interface with the world of typesetting and typography.
Second, 72 pixels inch is high enough resolution to allow a wide range of graphics and character sizes -- down to about eight points -- to be legible on the screen  see Fig.
1 , but not so high that the memory burden is onerous, as a screen that matched the 300 dot inch printer resolution would have been.
The pixel size and density is the same horizontally and vertically, unlike many PC graphic displays, simplifying the display software and improving image quality.
Windows -- It is now common for systems to allow several programs to display information simultaneously in separate areas of the screen, rather than each taking up the entire display.
Star was the first commercial system to provide this capability.
Some windowing systems allow windows to overlap each other.
Other systems don t: the size and position of windows are adjusted by the system as windows are opened and closed.
However, Star s designers observed in early testing that users spent a lot of time adjusting windows and usually adjusted them so that they did not overlap.
Because of this, and because Star s 17-inch screen was large enough that there wasn t as much of a need for overlapping windows as there is in systems having less screen space, the designers decided that application windows should be constrained so as not to overlap.
However, due to later recognition that there are situations in which overlapping application windows are preferable and a reduction in the standard screen size to 15 inches  with a 19-inch screen optional , the constraints were made optional in ViewPoint, Star s successor, with the default setting being that application windows can overlap one another.
Integrated applications -- This industry buzzword has been used to describe many things; here it means that text, graphics, tables, and mathematical formulae are all edited inside documents.
In many other systems, different types of content are edited in separate application windows and then cut pasted together.
For example: a MacDraw drawing put into a Microsoft Word or Aldus PageMaker document can no longer be edited; rather, the original must be re-edited with MacDraw and then substituted for the old drawing in the document.
Not even Star is fully integrated in the sense used here.
For example, though the original structured graphics editor, the new one  see History of Star Development, below , and the table and formula editors all operate inside text files, spreadsheets and freehand drawings are currently edited in separate application windows and transferred into documents, where they are no longer fully editable.
Fig.
1 -- ViewPoint screen image.
Star s bitmapped display, once unique in the market place, is now much more common.
Such a display permits WYSIWYG editing, display of proportionally-spaced fonts, integrated text and graphics, and graphical user interfaces.
Desktop Metaphor -- Star, unlike all conventional systems and many window-and-mouse-based ones, makes use of an analogy with real offices to make the system easy to learn.
This analogy is called  the Desktop metaphor .
Every user s initial view of Star is the Desktop, which resembles the top of an office desk, together with surrounding furniture and equipment.
It represents a working environment, where current projects and accessible resources reside.
On the screen are displayed pictures of familiar office objects, such as documents, folders, file drawers, in-baskets, and out-baskets.
These objects are displayed as small pictures, or icons.
The Desktop is the principal Star technique for realizing the physical office metaphor.
The icons on it are visible, concrete embodiments of the corresponding physical objects.
Star users are encouraged to think of the objects on the Desktop in physical terms.
You can move the icons around to arrange your Desktop as you wish.
Having windows and a mouse does not make a system an embodiment of the Desktop metaphor.
In a Desktop metaphor system, users deal mainly with data files, oblivious to the existence of programs.
They do not  invoke a text editor , they  open a document .
The system knows the type of each file and notifies the relevant application program when one is opened.
Such systems do not explicitly associate applications with data files; the burden of doing that -- and of making sure not to try to edit a spreadsheet file with the text editor or vice-versa -- is on users.
Star relieves users of the need to keep track of which data file goes with which application.
SunView is an example of a window system that is based upon the Tools metaphor rather than the Desktop metaphor.
Its users see a collection of application program windows, each of which is used to edit certain files.
Smalltalk-80, Cedar, and various Lisp environments also use the Tools metaphor rather than the Desktop metaphor.
This is not to say that the Desktop metaphor is superior to the Tools metaphor.
The Desktop metaphor was intended for office automation and publishing.
However, it can be argued that orienting users toward their data rather than toward application programs and employing analogies with the physical world are useful techniques in any domain.
The disadvantage of assigning data files to applications is that users sometimes want to operate on a file with a program other than its  assigned  application.
Such cases must be handled in Star in an ad hoc way, whereas systems like Unix allow almost any file to be run through a wide variety of programs.
Star s designers feel that, for its audience, the advantages of allowing users to forget about programs outweighs this disadvantage.
Generic commands -- One way to simplify a computer system is to reduce the number of commands.
Star achieves simplicity without sacrificing functionality by having a small set of generic commands apply to all types of data: Move, Copy, Open, Delete, Show Properties, and Same  Copy Properties .
These commands are invoked via dedicated function keys on Star s keyboard.
Each type of data object interprets a generic command in a way that is appropriate for it.
Delete Character, Delete Word, Delete Line, Delete Paragraph, Delete File.
Command modifiers are necessary in systems in which selection is only approximate.
Delete Word means:  delete the word that the cursor is on .
Modifiers are unnecessary in Star because exact selection of the objects of commands is easy.
In many systems, the large number of object-specific commands is made even more confusing by using single-word synonyms instead of command modifiers for similar operations on different objects.
For example, depending upon whether the object of the command is a file or text, the command to use might be Remove or Delete, Duplicate or Copy, and Find or Search, respectively.
Careful choice of the generic commands can further reduce the number of commands required.
For example, one might think it necessary to have a generic command Print for printing various things.
In Star, printing is invoked via the Copy command: users simply copy whatever they want to print to a printer icon.
No Print command is needed.
Similarly, the function Send Mail is handled via Move: by moving a document to the Out-basket.
Of course, not everything can be done via generic commands.
Some operations are object-specific.
For example, a word may be italicized, but italics is meaningless for a triangle.
In Star, object-specific operations are provided via selection-dependent  soft  function keys and via menus attached to application windows.
Direct manipulation; graphical user interface -- Traditional computer systems require users to remember and type a great deal just to control the system.
This is an impediment to learning and retention, especially by casual users.
Star s designers favored an approach that emphasizes recognition over recall, seeing and pointing over remembering and typing.
This suggested using menus rather than commands.
However, the designers wanted to go beyond a conventional menu-based approach.
They wanted users to feel that they are manipulating data directly, rather than issuing commands to the system to do it.
Star s designers also wanted to exploit the tremendous communication possibilities of the display.
They wanted to move away from strictly verbal communication.
Therefore, they based the system heavily upon principles that are now known as direct manipulation and graphical control.
Star users control the system by manipulating graphical elements on the screen, elements that represent the state of the system and data created by users.
When Star displays a directory, it -- unlike MS-DOS and Unix -- is not displaying a list of the names of the files in the directory, it is displaying the files themselves so that they can be manipulated by the user.
Users of this type of system have the feeling that they are operating upon the data directly, rather than via an agent: like fetching a book from a library shelf onesself rather than asking someone to do it.
A related principle is that the state of the system is always reflected in the display.
Nothing happens  behind the user s back.  One needn t fiddle with the system to understand what s going on; one can understand by inspection.
When everything in a computer system is visible on the screen, the display becomes reality.
Objects and actions can be understood purely in terms of their effects upon the display.
An example of this philosophy is the fact that -- unlike many window-based computer systems, even some developed at Xerox -- there are no hidden menus in Star: all available menus are marked via menu buttons.
For a more detailed explanation of Direct Manipulation, see the Sidebar .
Icons and iconic file management -- Computer users often have difficulty managing their files.
Before Star existed, a secretary at Xerox complained that she couldn t keep track of the files on her disk.
An inspection of her system revealed files named: memo, memo1, memo071479, letter, etc.
Naming things to keep track of them is bothersome enough for programmers, but completely unnatural for most people.
Star alleviates this problem partly by representing data files via pictures of office objects called icons.
Every application data file in the system has an icon representing it.
Each type of file has a characteristic icon shape.
If a user is looking for a spreadsheet, his or her eye can skip over mailboxes, printers, text documents, etc.
Furthermore, Star allows users to organize files spatially rather than via distinctive naming.
Systems having hierarchical directories, such as Unix and MS-DOS, provide an abstract sort of  spatial  file organization, but Star s approach is concrete.
Files can be kept together by putting them into a folder or simply by clumping them together on the Desktop, modeling how people organize their physical worlds.
Since data files are represented by icons, and files are distinguished by location and specified by selection rather than by name, users can use names like memo, memo1, letter, etc.
As bitmap, window, and mouse-based systems become more common, the use of the term  icon  is widening to refer to any non-textual symbol on the display.
In standard English,  icon  is a term for religious statues or pictures that are believed to contain some of the powers of the deities they represent.
It would be more consistent with its normal meaning if  icon  were reserved for objects having behavior and intrinsic properties.
Most graphical symbols and labels on computer screens are therefore not icons.
In Star, only representations of files on the Desktop and in folders, mailboxes, and file drawers are called  icons .
Few modes -- A system has modes if user-actions differ in effects or availability in different situations.
3 Though modes can be helpful in guiding users through unfamiliar procedures or for handling exceptional activities, they should be used sparingly and with care.
Star avoids modes in several ways.
In conventional systems, arguments follow commands, either on a command line or in response to prompts.
Whether a system uses Noun-Verb or Verb-Noun syntax has a lot to do with how moded it is.
In a Noun-Verb system such as Star, selecting an object prior to choosing a command does not put the system into a mode: users can decide not to invoke the command without having to  escape out  of anything or can select a different object to operate on.
Though modes are avoided in Star, it is not completely modeless.
For example, the Move and Copy commands require two arguments: the object to be moved and the final destination.
Though there are less moded ways to design Move and Copy, these functions currently require the user to select the object to be moved or copied, press the Move or Copy key, and then indicate the destination using the mouse.
While Star waits for the user to point to a destination, it is in Move or Copy mode: other uses of the mouse are precluded.
These modes are, however, relatively harmless because: 1  the state of the system is clearly indicated by the shape of the cursor, and 2  they are entered and exited by a user in the course of carrying out a single mental plan, making it unlikely that the system will be in the  wrong  mode when the user begins his or her next action.
Objects have properties -- Properties allow objects of the same type to vary in appearance, layout, and behavior.
For example, files have a Name property, characters have a Font family property, paragraphs have a Justified property.
Properties may have different types of values: The Name property of a file is a text string; the Size property of a character might be a number or a choice from a menu; the Justified property of a paragraph is either ON or OFF.
In Star, properties are displayed and changed in graphical forms called property sheets.
Property-based systems are rare.
Most computer systems, even today, allow users to set parameters for the duration of an interactive session, or for the duration of a command, but not for particular data-objects.
For example, headings in WordStar documents do not  remember  whether they are centered or not; whether a line is centered is determined by how the program was set when the line was typed.
Similarly, directories in Unix do not  remember  whether files are to be listed in alphabetical or temporal order; users must respecify which display order they want every time they invoke the ls command.
4 Indeed, many computer systems overwhelm their users with choices, commands to remember, and poorly organized output, much of which is irrelevant to what the user is trying to do.
They make no presumptions about what the user wants, and thus are designed as if all possible user actions were equally likely and as if all information generated by the system were of equal interest to the user.
Some systems diminish the problem somewhat by providing default settings of parameters to simplify tasks expected to be common.
Star goes further towards alleviating this problem by applying a principle called  progressive disclosure .
Progressive disclosure dictates that detail be hidden from users until they ask or need to see it.
Thus, Star not only provides default settings, it hides settings that users are unlikely to change until users indicate that they want to change them.
Implicit in this design are assumptions about which properties will be less frequently altered.
One place progressive disclosure is used is in property sheets.
Some objects have a large number of properties, many of which are relevant only when other properties have certain values  see Fig.
2 .
For example, on the page layout property sheet, there is no reason to display all of the properties for specifying running header content and position unless the user actually specifies that the document is to have running headers.
Another example of progressive disclosure is the fact that property displays in Star are temporary, displayed on demand.
In some systems, the properties of the current selection are displayed at all times -- via codes embedded in the text or in an area of the screen reserved for that purpose -- even though the user usually doesn t care.
Fig.
2 -- Progressive disclosure.
Star s property sheets, like the rest of the interface, make use of a principle known as  progressive disclosure  to avoid overwhelming users with information.
Usually, users don t need to see an object s properties: they only need to see and perhaps change its assigned style.
Users see an object s properties only upon request.
Also, even when a user sets a property sheet to show an object s properties, as is shown above, some information is hidden until the user asks to see it.
For example, there is no need to clutter the property sheet shown above with boxes for entering numbers for  Other  values of Line Height, Spacing Before Paragraph, or Spacing After Paragraph until the user has actually sets the property to  Other .
Thus, styles hide needless detail from users.
Consistency -- Because Star and all of its applications were designed and developed in-house, its designers had more control over its user interface than is usually the case with computer systems.
Because the designers payed close attention to detail, a very high degree of consistency was achieved.
The left mouse button always selects; the right always extends the selection.
Mouse sensitive areas always give feedback when the left button goes down, but never take effect until the button comes up.
Strong emphasis on good graphic and screen design -- Windows, icons, and property sheets are useless if users can t easily distinguish them from the background or each other, can t easily see which labels correspond to which objects, or are overwhelmed with visual clutter.
To assure that Star presents information in a maximally-perceivable and useful fashion, Xerox hired graphic designers to determine the appearance and placement of screen objects.
These designers applied various written and unwritten principles to the design of the window headers and borders, the Desktop background, the command buttons, the pop-up menus, the property sheets, and the Desktop icons.
The illusion of manipulable objects -- One goal,    fundamental to the notion of direct manipulation, is to create the    illusion of manipulable objects.
It should be clear that objects    can be selected and how to select them.
It should be obvious when    they are selected and that the next action will apply to    them.
Whereas the usual task of graphic designers is to present    information for passive viewing, Star s designers had to figure    out how to present information for manipulation as well.
This can    be seen most clearly in the Desktop icons, where there is a clear    figure ground relationship: the icons stand by themselves, with    self-contained labels.
Windows reveal in their borders the     handles  for scrolling, paging, window-specific commands and    pop-up menus.
Visual order and user focus -- One of the most obvious    contributions of good graphic design is to provide appropriate    visual order and focus to the screen.
For example, intensity and    contrast, when appropriately applied, draw the user s attention to    the most important features of the display.
In some windowing systems, window interiors have the same  dark     color as the Desktop background.
Window content should have high    intensity relative to the Desktop, to draw attention to what is    important on the screen.
In Star, window content background is    white, both for high contrast and to simulate paper.
Star keeps the amount of black on the screen to a minimum to make    the selection stand out  see Fig.
3 .
In most windowing systems,    window headers and other areas of the screen are black, making the    selection hard to find.
This principle is so important that Star s    designers made sure that the display hardware could fill the    non-addressable border of the screen with Desktop grey rather than    leaving it black as in most systems.
Star also uses icon images    that turn from mostly white to mostly black when selected  see    Fig.
4 , and allows at most one selection on the screen at a time.
Figure 3 -- Visual order and user focus.
The large amount of contrast present on the screens of many window    systems  upper screen  makes it difficult to focus on the relevant    information.
The selection should be the user s main focus: it is    the object of the next operation.
The lower screen shows how    Star ViewPoint s screen design focuses attention on the selection.
Figure 4 -- Visual order and user focus.
Four candidate sets of icons were designed and tested for Star.
A    representative sample from each set is shown here.
In Star, the    icon selected by the user to be operated on is indicated by    inverting its image.
Candidate icon sets in which the images are    mostly white allow icons to stand out when they are selected by    the user.
The set that best satisfies this criterion, the one on    the upper left, was chosen.
Revealed structure -- Often, the more powerful the    program being used, the greater the distance between intention and    effect.
If all that is displayed is effect and not intention, the    user s task of learning the connection is much more difficult.
For example, there are many ways to    determine the position and length of a line of text on a page.
It    can be done with page margins, paragraph indentations, centering,    tabs, blank lines, or spaces.
The WYSIWYG view of all these would    be identical.
That would be enough if all that mattered to the    user was the final form on paper.
But what will happen if    characters are inserted?
If the line is moved to another page,    where will it land?
WYSIWYG views are sometimes not enough.
Special views are one method of revealing structure.
In Star,    documents can show  Structure  and or  Non-Printing Characters  if    desired  see Fig.
5 .
Another convenient means for revealing    structure is to make it show up during selection.
For example,    when a rectangle is selected in a graphics frame, what highlights    it are eight control points, any of which can attach to the    cursor during Move or Copy and can land on grid points for precise alignment.
The control point    highlighting allows a user to distinguish a rectangle from four    straight lines; both might produce the same printed effect but    would respond differently to editing.
Figure 5 -- -- Revealed structure.
At the top is the WYSIWYG view of mixed text and graphics.
The    middle two panels show that structure is revealed when an object    is selected.
When a line segment is selected, its control points    are shown.
When text is selected, the text  string  is revealed.
The bottom panel shows the effect of the Show Structure and Show    Non-Printing Characters commands, which is to reveal the location    of embedded graphics and text frames  dotted lines  and  new    paragraph  and SPACE characters.
Consistent and appropriate graphic vocabulary --    Property sheets  see Fig.
2  present a form-like display for the    user to specify detailed property settings and arguments to    commands.
They were designed with a consistent graphic vocabulary.
All of the user s targets are in boxes; unchangeable information    such as a property name is not boxed.
Mutually exclusive values    within choice parameters are shown with boxes adjacent.
Independent  on off  or state parameters are shown with    boxes separated.
The current settings are shown inverted.
Some of    the menus display graphic symbols rather than text.
Finally, there    are text parameters consisting of a box into which text or    numbers can be typed, copied or moved, and within which text    editing functions are available.
Match the medium -- It is in this last principle that    the sensitivities of a good graphic designer are most apparent.
The goal is to create a consistent quality in the graphics that is    appropriate to the product and makes the most of the given medium.
Star has a large black and white display.
The solutions the    graphics designers devised might have been very different had the    display had grey-scale or color pixels.
A common problem with raster displays is  jaggies : diagonal lines    appearing as staircases.
With careful design, jaggies can be    avoided, for example, by using only vertical, horizontal, and    45-degree angles.
Also important is controlling how the edges of    the figures interact with the texture of the ground.
Figure 6    shows how edges are carefully matched to the background texture so    that they have a consistent quality appearance.
Fig.
6 -- Desktop grey.
25% grey pattern designed to reduce flicker and provide background texture.
WYSIWYG document editor -- Within the limits of screen resolution, Star documents are displayed as they will be printed, including typographic features such as boldface, italics, proportional spacing, variable font families, superscripts, and layout features such as embedded graphics, page numbers, headers, and footers.
This is commonly referred to as  What You See Is What You Get , or  WYSIWYG .
Star adheres to this principle even in domains where other  WYSIWYG  document editors do not.
For example, mathematical formulae are created and edited in documents using a WYSIWYG editor that has knowledge built into it about the appearance and layout of mathematical symbols.
A square root sign has a slot for an expression, and grows when the expression becomes large  see Fig.
7 .
1, n,  x*3  2    to represent the formula that will eventually be printed.
Formulae created with such systems usually require several print-edit cycles to get right.
Fig.
7 -- WYSIWYG formula editing.
Mathematical formulae are edited in Star in a highly-WYSIWYG fashion, in contrast to most systems, in which formulae are specified via in-line expressions or by constructing them from pieces in a special character font.
ASCII or EBCDIC .
The Star character set is a superset of ASCII.
The reason for a sixteen bit code is a strong market requirement for enhanced multilingual capabilility coming from Xerox s subsidiaries in Europe and Japan.
Most systems provide non-English characters via different fonts, so that the eight-bit  extended  ASCII codes might be rendered as math symbols in one font, Greek letters in another font, and Arabic in yet another.
This has the effect that when any application loses track of font information while handling the text  which happens often in some systems , a paragraph of Arabic may turn into nonsensical Greek or math symbols or something else, and vice-versa.
Star uses sixteen-bit character codes to permit the system to reliably handle European languages and also Japanese, which uses many thousands of characters.
All Star and ViewPoint systems have French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian language capabilities built in.
S.
Since that time, many more characters have been added, covering Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, and nearly all European languages.
5,6,7 Clever typing schemes and sophisticated rendering algorithms are required to provide a multilingual capability that satisfies customers.
The document is the heart of the world, and unifies it -- Most personal computers and workstations give no special status to any particular application.
Dozens of applications are available, most of which are incompatible with each other in data format as well as user interface.
Star, in contrast, assumes that the primary use of the system is to create and maintain documents.
The document editor is thus the primary application.
All other applications exist mainly to provide or manipulate information whose ultimate destination is a document.
Thus, most applications are integrated into the document editor  see Integrated applications, above , operating within frames embedded in documents, and those applications that are not part of the document editor support transfer of their data to documents.
Having described what Star and ViewPoint are, we will describe where they came from and how they were developed.
Fig.
8 graphs this history, showing systems that influenced Star and those that were influenced by it.
Fig.
8 -- How systems influenced later systems.
This graph summarizes how various systems related to Star have influenced one another over the years.
Time progresses downwards.
Many  influence arrows  are due to key designers changing jobs or applying concepts from their graduate research to products.
Although Star was conceived as a product in 1975 and was released in 1981, many of the ideas that went into it were born in projects dating back over three decades.
D.
Roosevelt s science advisors, wrote an article describing his vision of the uses of electronics and information technology.
At a time when computers were new, room-sized, and used only for military number-crunching, Bush envisioned a personal, desktop computer for non-numerical applications, and called it the Memex.
Due to insufficient technology and insufficient imagination on the part of others, Bush s ideas languished for fifteen years.
SketchPad -- In the Sixties, people began to take interactive computing seriously.
One such person was Ivan Sutherland.
He built an interactive graphics system called Sketchpad that allowed a user to create graphical figures on a CRT display using a light pen.
The geometric shapes users put on the screen were treated as objects: after being created, they could be moved, copied, shrunk, expanded, and rotated.
They could also be joined together to make larger, more complex objects that could then be operated upon as units.
Sketchpad influenced Star s user interface as a whole as well as its graphics applications.
NLS -- Also in the Sixties, Douglas Engelbart established a research program at Stanford Research Institute  now called SRI International  for exploring the use of computers  to augment the knowledge worker  and human intellect in general.
He and his collegues experimented with different types of displays and input devices -- inventing the mouse when other pointing devices proved inadequate -- and developed a system commonly known as NLS.
2 * NLS was unique in several respects.
It used CRT displays when most computers used teletypes.
It was full-screen-oriented when the few systems that were interactive were line-oriented.
It used a mouse when all other graphic interactive systems used cursor keys, light pens, joy sticks, or digitizing tablets.
Finally, it was the first system to organize textual and graphical information in trees and networks, which today would be called an  idea processor  or a  hypertext system .
The Reactive Engine -- While Engelbart et al were developing ideas, some of which eventually found their way into Star, Alan Kay, then a graduate student, was doing likewise.
His dissertation, The Reactive Engine, contained seeds of many ideas that he and others later brought to fruition in the Smalltalk language and programming environment, which, in turn, influenced Star.
Like the designers of NLS, Kay realized that interactive applications do not have to treat the display as a  glass teletype  and can share the screen with other programs.
Xerox s planned expansion into the office systems business.
The Palo Alto Research Center  abbreviated  PARC   was organized into several laboratories, each devoted to basic and applied research in a field related to the above goals.
The names and organization of the labs have changed over the years, but the research topics have stayed the same: materials science, laser physics, integrated circuitry, CAD CAM, user interface  not necessarily to computers , and computer science  including networking, databases, operating systems, languages and programming environments, graphics, document production systems, and artificial intelligence .
Alto -- PARC researchers were fond of the slogan:  The best way to predict the future is to invent it.  After some initial experiments with time-shared systems, they began searching for a new approach to computing.
Among the founding members of PARC was Alan Kay.
He and his collegues were acquainted with NLS and liked its novel approach to human-computer interaction.
Soon, PARC hired several people who had worked on NLS and in 1971 signed an agreement with SRI licensing Xerox to use the mouse.
Kay and others were dedicated to a vision of personal computers in a distributed environment.
In fact, they coined the term  personal computer  in 1973, long before microcomputers started what has been called the  personal computer revolution .
One result of the search for a new approach was the Alto  see Fig 9 .
5 mega-byte hard disk pack  floppy disks did not exist at the time  and 128 to 256 kbytes of memory.
Unlike most machines of its day, the Alto also had a microprogrammable instruction set, a  full-page   10 1 2 x 8 1 4 inch; 600 x 800 pixel  bitmapped graphic display, about 50 kbytes of high-speed display memory, and a mouse.
The first Alto was operational in 1972.
At first, only a half-dozen or so Altos were built.
After software that exploited the Alto s capabilities became available, demand for them grew tremendously, spreading beyond PARC into Xerox as a whole and even to external customers.
Eventually, over a thousand Altos were built.
Ethernet -- Another product of the new approach was the Ethernet.
With its standardized, layered communications protocols, Ethernet provides a way of connecting computers much more flexibly than had been previously possible.
Soon after the first Altos were built, they were networked together.
Eventually, the network grew to thousands of workstations  Altos and Alto-successors  within Xerox s worldwide organization, giving Xerox millions of person-hours of experience with networked personal computers and servers.
Smalltalk -- Alan Kay had been one of the main advocates of the Alto.
His Learning Research Group  LRG  began using the Alto to build prototypes for a personal computing system  of the future : a portable machine that would provide -- rather than a canned set of applications -- the building blocks necessary for users to build the tools and applications they need to solve their own information processing problems.
The technologies needed to build a lap computer with the power of the  DynaBook   as the envisioned system was called  were unavailable at the time, and still are.
The prototypes developed by Kay s group evolved into the Smalltalk language and programming environment.
They further promoted the notion of personal computing, pioneered complete, interactive programming environments, and refined and solidified concepts of object-oriented programming that had been extant only in vestigial form in previous systems.
Most importantly for Star, they demonstrated the power of graphical, bitmapped displays, mouse-driven input, windows, and simultaneous applications.
This is the most visible link between Smalltalk and Star, and is perhaps why many people wrongly believe that Star was written in Smalltalk.
Pygmalion -- The first large program to be written in Smalltalk was Pygmalion, the doctoral thesis project of David Smith.
One goal of Pygmalion was to show that programming a computer does not have to be primarily a textual activity: it can be accomplished, given the appropriate system, by interacting with graphical elements on a screen.
The idea of using icons -- images that allow users to manipulate them and in so doing act upon the data they represent -- came mainly from Pygmalion.
After completing Pygmalion, Smith worked briefly on the NLS project at SRI before joining the Star development team at Xerox.
Bravo, Gypsy, and BravoX -- At the same time that LRG was developing Smalltalk for the Alto, others at PARC, mainly Charles Simonyi and Butler Lampson, were writing an advanced document editing system for it: Bravo.
Because it made heavy use of the Alto s bitmapped screen, Bravo was unquestionably the most WYSIWYG text editor of its day, with on-screen underlining, boldfacing, italics, variable font families and sizes, and variable-width characters.
It allowed the screen to be split, so that different documents or different parts of the same document could be edited at once, but did not operate in a windowed environment as we use the term today.
Bravo was widely-used at PARC and in Xerox as a whole.
In 1976-78, Simonyi and others rewrote Bravo, incorporating many of the new user-interface ideas floating around PARC at the time.
One such idea was modelessness, promoted by Larry Tesler3 and exemplified in Telser s prototype text editor Gypsy.
They also added styles, enhancing users  ability to control the appearance of their documents.
The new version was called BravoX.
Shortly thereafter, Simonyi joined Microsoft, where he led the development of Microsoft Word, a direct descendent of BravoX.
Another member of the BravoX team, Tom Malloy, went to Apple and wrote LisaWrite.
Alto and later machines.
Draw, by Patrick Beaudelaire and Bob Sproull, and SIL  for Simple Illustrator  were intellectual successors of Sutherland s Sketchpad  see above : graphical object editors that allowed users to construct figures out of selectable, movable, stretchable geometric forms and text.
In turn, Star s graphic frames capability is in large measure an intellectual successor of Draw and SIL.
William Newman in BCPL for the Alto.
Flyer was another paint program, written in Smalltalk for the Alto by Bob Flegel and Bill Bowman.
These programs inspired Doodle, a paint program written for a later machine by Dan Silva.
Doodle eventually evolved into ViewPoint s Free-Hand Drawing application.
Silva went on to write DeluxePaint, a paint program for PCs.
Laser Printing -- Fancy graphics capabilities in a workstation are of little use without hardcopy capability to match it.
Laser printing, invented at PARC, provided the necessary base capability, but a way was needed for computers to describe output to laser printers in a uniform way.
For this purpose, Bob Sproull developed the Press page-description language.
Press was heavily used at PARC, then further developed into Interpress, Xerox s product page-description language and the language in which Star encodes printer output.
Some of the developers of Interpress later formed Adobe Systems and developed Postscript, a popular page description language.
Laurel and Hardy -- A network of personal workstations suggests electronic mail.
Though electronic mail was not invented at PARC, PARC researchers  mainly Doug Brotz  made it user-friendly for the first time by creating Laurel, a display-oriented tool for sending, receiving, and organizing e-mail.
The experience of using Laurel, which was named after a tree, inspired others to write Hardy, named after Laurel, for an Alto successor machine.
Laurel and Hardy were instrumental in getting non-engineers at Xerox to use e-mail.
The use of e-mail spread further when Star and ViewPoint spread throughout Xerox.
Today, Xerox employees depend heavily upon the company s global e-mail network for communication, both work-related and otherwise, with other employees.
OfficeTalk -- One more Alto program that influenced Star was OfficeTalk, a prototype office automation system written by Clarence  Skip  Ellis and Gary Nutt.
OfficeTalk supported standard office automation tasks and tracked  jobs  as they went from person to person in an organization.
Experience with OfficeTalk provided ideas for Star because of the two systems  similar target applications.
Alto served as a valuable prototype for Star.
Alto users have had several thousand work-years of experience with them over a period of eight years, making Alto perhaps the largest prototyping effort in history.
There were dozens of experimental programs written for the Alto by members of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
Without the creative ideas of the authors of these systems, Star in its present form would have been impossible.
To develop Star and other office systems products, Xerox created the Systems Development Department  SDD .
SDD was staffed by transferring people from other parts of Xerox, including PARC, as well as by hiring from outside.
Thus, contrary to what has often been stated in the industry press, Star was not developed at PARC, but rather in a separate product development organization.
When SDD was formed, a decision was made to use Mesa, an  industrial-strength  dialect of Pascal that had been conceived at SRI and further developed at PARC, as the primary product programming language.
SDD took over development and maintenance of Mesa from the Computer Science Laboratory  CSL  at PARC, freeing CSL to develop Mesa s research successor, Cedar.
Star Hardware -- Star is often discussed as if it were a computer.
In fact, Star is a body of software.
3 * However, using the name Star to refer to the machine is understandable since the machine was designed in conjunction with the software to meet the needs of the software design.
This is in sharp contrast to the usual approach, in which software is designed for existing computers.
The 8000-series workstation was based upon a microcoded processor that was designed within Xerox especially to run the object code produced by the Mesa compiler.
Besides being microprogrammed to run Mesa, the processor provided low-level operations for facilitating display operations.
For example, the BitBlt operation for manipulating rectangular arrays of screen pixels is implemented as a single instruction.
5 Mbytes , a local hard disk  10, 29, or 40 Mbytes , a 17-inch display, a mechanical mouse, an eight-inch floppy disk drive, and an Ethernet connection.
The price was initially $16,500 with software.
Even though the machine was designed to run Star, it also ran other software.
In addition to selling it as the 8010  Star  workstation, Xerox sold it as a server machine and as an Interlisp and a Smalltalk workstation.
Star Software -- Alhough Star incorporated ideas from a number of predecessors, it still required a mammoth design effort to pull all of those ideas -- as well as new ideas -- together to produce a coherent design.
1 About thirty person-years went into the design of the user interface, functionality, and hardware.
To foster uniformity of specifications as well as thoughtful and uniform design, Star s designers developed a strict format for specifications.
Applications and system features were to be described in terms of the objects that users would manipulate via the software and the actions that the software provided for manipulating objects.
This  objects and actions  analysis was supposed to be at a fairly high level, without regard to how the objects would actually be presented or how the actions would actually be invoked by users.
A full specification was then written from the  objects and actions  version.
This approach forced designers to think clearly about the purpose of each application or feature and fostered recognition of similar operations across specifications, allowing what might have seemed like new operations to be handled via existing commands.
When SDD was formed, it was split between two locations: Southern California  El Segundo  and Northern California  Palo Alto .
Few people were willing to transfer one way or the other, leaving SDD with the choice of losing many competent engineers or being creative.
SDD s management took the creative route: they put the Ethernet to work, putting the development machines at both sites onto a network, connecting the two sites via a 56 kbit second leased line, encouraging heavy use of electronic mail for work-related communication, and developing tools for facilitating distributed, multi-party development.
As might be expected from Star s origins, most of the design and prototyping work was done in Palo Alto, whereas most of the implementation was done in El Segundo.
Though this split was handled creatively, some of Star s designers now believe it caused problems that were not overcome by extensive use of e-mail.
For example, the implementors did not benefit from much of the prototyping that had been done at PARC.
The development process has been recounted in detail elsewhere6 and will not be repeated here.
Star Functional Specification    unimplemented.
Since the machine upon which Star ran was developed in parallel with the software, it was not available early-on to be used as a software development platform.
Early prototyping and development was done on Altos and successor research machines developed at PARC.
Though the Mesa language ran on these machines, development aids for Mesa programmers were lacking.
When the 8000-series workstation was available, the systems group within SDD began developing a suitable development environment.
When it became available, the development environment, known internally as Tajo and externally as Xerox Development Environment  XDE , and the numerous tools written to run in it were quickly adopted by programmers throughout SDD.
As Star was improved later, many good ideas from Tajo were adopted.
ViewPoint Software -- Soon after Star was released, the designers and implementers realized that it had serious problems from a performance, maintenance, and enhancement standpoint.
Its high degree of integration and user-interface consistency had been achieved by making it monolithic: the system  knew  about all applications and all parts of the system  knew  about all other parts.
It was difficult to correct problems, add new features, and increase performance.
The monolithic architecture also did not lend itself to distributed, multi-party development.
This created pressure to rewrite Star.
Bob Ayers, who had been heavily involved in the development of Star, rewrote the infrastructure of the system according to the more flexible Tajo model.
He built, on top of the operating system and low-level window manager, a  toolkit  for building Star-like applications.
Transfer of data between different applications was handled in the new infrastructure via strict protocols involving the user s selection, thus making applications independent from one another.
The object-oriented user interface, which requires that the system associate applications with data files, was preserved by having applications register themselves with the system when started, telling it which type of data file they correspond to and registering procedures for handling keyboard and mouse events and generic commands.
User-interface consistency was fostered by building many of the standards into the application toolkit.
The development organization completed the toolkit and then ported or rewrote the existing applications and utilities to run on top of it.
To underscore the fact that the new system was a substantial improvement over the old, the name was changed from Star to ViewPoint.
0 was released in 1985.
ViewPoint Hardware -- In addition to revising the software, Xerox brought the hardware up to date by designing a completely new vehicle for ViewPoint: the 6085 workstation.
The new machine was designed to take advantage of advances in integrated circuitry, reductions in memory costs, new disk technologies, and new standards in keyboard design, as well as to provide IBM PC compatibility.
The 6085 workstation has a Mesa processor plus an optional IBM-PC-compatible processor, one megabyte of real memory  expandable to 4 megabytes , a hard disk  10 - 80 megabytes , a choice of a 15- or a 19-inch display, an optical mouse, a new keyboard, a 5 1 4 inch floppy disk drive, and, of course, an Ethernet connection.
The base cost was initially $6340 with the ViewPoint software.
Like the 8010, the 6085 is sold as a vehicle for Interlisp and Smalltalk as well as for ViewPoint.
0 has recently been released, adding many features relevant to desktop publishing.
Stylesheets, for facilitating control of document appearance.
Partly out of excitement over what they were doing, PARC researchers and Star s designers didn t pay enough attention to the  other  personal computer revolution that was occurring outside of Xerox.
Star s designers to the need to approach the market via cheap, stand-alone PCs.
The result was a product that was highly unfamiliar.
Nowadays, of course, such systems are no longer unusual.
Developing Star and ViewPoint involved developing several enabling technologies, for networking, communicating with servers, describing pages to laser printers, and software development.
At the time they were developed, these technologies were unique in the industry.
Xerox elected to keep them proprietary for fear of losing its competitive advantage.
With hindsight, we can say that it may have been better to release these technologies into the public domain, or at least to market them early, so that they would become industry standards.
Instead, alternative approaches developed at other companies have become the industry standards.
Open Look  indicates its desire to reverse this trend.
The personal computer revolution has shown that it is futile to try to anticipate all of the applications that customers will want.
Star should have been designed to be open and extensible by users from the start, as the Alto was.
In hindsight, extensibility was one of the keys to the Alto s popularity.
The problem wasn t that Star lacked functionality, it was that it didn t have the functionality customers wanted.
An example is the initial lack of a spreadsheet application.
The designers failed to appreciate the significance of this application, which may have been more important even than word-processing in expanding the personal computer revolution beyond engineers and hobbyists into business.
Eventually realizing that Star s closedness was a problem, Xerox replaced it with ViewPoint, a more  open  system that allows users to pick and choose applications that they need, including a spreadsheet and IBM PC software.
Apple Computer learned the same lesson with its Lisa computer, and similarly replaced it with a cheaper one having a more open software architecture: Macintosh.
Star s initial per-workstation price was near that of time-shared mini-computers, dedicated word-processors, and other shared computing facilities.
Star was, however, competing for desktop space with micro-computer-based PCs.
ViewPoint has corrected that problem: The 6085 costs about the same as its competition.
Star s designers should have established performance goals, documented them in the functional specifications, and stuck to them as Star was being developed.
Where performance goals couldn t be met, the corresponding functionality should have been cut.
In lieu of speed, the user-interface should have been designed to be more responsive.
By designing the system to handle user input more intelligently, systems can be made more responsive without necessarily making them execute functions faster.
ViewPoint now makes use of background processes to increase its responsiveness.
Having a development organization that was split between Palo Alto and El Segundo was probably a mistake, less for reasons of distance per se than for lack of shared background in  PARC-style  computing.
However, the adverse effect of sheer distance upon communication was certainly a factor.
Direct Manipulation and the Desktop metaphor aren t the best way to do everything.
Remembering and typing is sometimes better than seeing and pointing.
For example, if a user wants to open a file that is one of several hundred in a directory  folder , the system should let users type its name rather than forcing them to scroll through the directory trying to spot it so they can select it.
Though there are aspects of Star that perhaps should have been done differently, most of the aspects of Star s design described at the beginning of this article have withstood the test of time.
Iconic, direct-manipulation, object-oriented user interface -- The days of cryptic command languages and scores of commands for users to remember  a la Unix and MS-DOS  should have passed long ago.
Generic commands and consistency in general -- Even Macintosh could use some lessons in this regard: it uses Duplicate for copying files within a disk but dragging of icons for copying them across disks, not to mention Copy-Paste for copying anything else.
Pointing device -- Although cursor keys have some advantages and certainly would have enhanced Star s market appeal  as they have ViewPoint s , Star s designers stand by the system s primary reliance on the mouse.
This does not imply a commitment to the mouse per se, but rather to any pointing device that allows quick pointing and selection.
As interfaces evolve in the future, high-resolution touch screens and other more exotic devices may replace mice as the pointing devices of choice.
High-resolution display -- Memory is now cheap: the    justification for character displays is gone.
Good graphic design -- Screen graphics designed by computer    programmers will not satisfy customers.
The Star designers    recognized their limitations in this regard and hired the right    people for the job.
As color displays gain market presence, the    participation of graphic designers will be even more crucial.
ASCII .
Star and ViewPoint s use of a 16-bit character set and of    special typing and rendering algorithms for foreign languages is    the correct approach.
Distributed, personal computing -- Though the reorientation of    the industry away from batch and time-shared computing toward    personal computing had nothing to do with Xerox, PARC, or Star, it    was an important part of the computing philosophy that led to    Star.
Star has had an indisputable influence on the design of computer systems.
Byte: Do you have a Xerox Star here that you work with?
Telser: No, we didn t have one here.
We went to the NCC when the Star was announced and looked at it.
And in fact it did have an immediate impact.
A few months after looking at it we made some changes to our user interface based on ideas that we got from it.
For example, the desktop manager we had before was completely different; it didn t use icons at all, and we never liked it very much.
We decided to change ours to the icon base.
That was probably the only thing we got from Star, I think.
Elements of the Desktop metaphor approach can also be seen in many other systems.
The history presented here has shown, however, that Star s designers did not invent the system out of nothingness.
Just as it has influenced systems that came after it, Star was influenced by ideas and systems that came before it.
It is difficult to inhibit the spread of good ideas once they are apparent to all, especially in this industry.
Star was thus just one step -- albeit an important one -- in an evolutionary process that will continue both at Xerox and elsewhere.
That is how it should be.

When Star was announced, several articles on it appeared in trade magazines, journals, and at conferences.
Many of these were reprinted in the Xerox publication Office Systems Technology  see Bibliography .
Since then, several more articles have been published that are relevant to this retrospective.
They include an article from MacWorld 48 that describes the historical antecedents of Apple Computer s Lisa and Macintosh computers, which share much of Star s history.
This retrospective owes a great deal to those previous writings.
We also acknowledge the valuable contributions that Joe Becker, Bill Mallgren, Doug Carothers, Linda Bergsteinsson, and Randy Polen of Xerox Corporation, Bob Ayers, Ralph Kimball, Dave Fylstra, and John Shoch made to this retrospective.

The Xerox Star has had a significant impact upon the computer industry.
In this retrospective, several of Star s designers describe how Star was and is unique, its historical antecedents, how it was designed and developed, how it has evolved since its introduction, and, finally, some lessons learned.
In April of 1981, Xerox introduced the 8010  Star  Information System.
Star s introduction was an important event in the history of personal computing because it changed notions of how interactive systems should be designed.
Several of Star s designers, some of whom were responsible for the original design and others of whom designed recent improvements, describe in this article where Star came from, what is distinctive about it, and how the original design has changed.
In doing so, we hope to correct some misconceptions about Star that we have seen expressed in the trade press, and to relate some of what we have learned from the experience of designing it.
In this article, the name  Star  usually refers to both Star and its successor, ViewPoint.
We begin by describing Star as a static system: stating what Star was intended to be and by listing and discussing the aspects that made -- and in some cases still make -- it unique.
Following that, we describe how Star came about and how it has changed since its introduction.
Finally, we discuss what we have learned from the experience of designing and building Star.
Star was designed as an office automation system.
The idea was that professionals in a business or organization would have workstations on their desks and would use them to produce, retrieve, distribute, and organize documentation, presentations, memos, and reports.
All of the workstations in an organization would be connected via Ethernet and would share access to file servers, printers, etc.
Star s designers assumed that the target users are interested in getting their work done and not at all interested in computers.
Therefore, an important design goal was to make the  computer  as invisible to users as possible.
The applications included in the system were those that office professionals would supposedly need: documents, business graphics, tables, personal data-base, and electronic mail.
The set was fixed, always loaded, and automatically associated with data files, eliminating the need for users to worry about obtaining, installing, and starting the right application for a given task or data file.
Users could focus on their work, oblivious of concepts like software, operating systems, applications, and programs.
Another important assumption was that Star s users would be casual, occasional users, rather than people who spent most of their time at the machine.
This assumption led to the goal of having Star be easy to learn and remember.
When Star was first introduced in 1981, its bitmapped screen, windows, mouse-driven interface, and icons were unique in the marketplace.
They were readily-apparent features that clearly distinguished it from other computers.
Soon, however, these features were adopted by others.
Today, windows, mice, and icons are more common.
However, Star s clean, consistent user interface has much more to do with its details than with its gross features.
We list here the features that we think make Star what it is, categorized according to their level in the system architecture, the levels being: machine and network, window and file manager, user-interface, and document editor.
Distributed, personal computing -- Though ViewPoint is available in a stand-alone configuration, Star and ViewPoint were designed primarily to operate in a distributed computing environment.
This approach combines the advantages and avoids the disadvantages of the two other primary approaches to interactive computing: time-shared systems and stand-alone personal computers.
Time-shared systems, dominant through the Sixties and Seventies, allow expensive resources like printers and large data stores to be shared by many users and help assure the consistency of data that must be used by many.
The disadvantages of timesharing are that all users are dependent upon the continued functioning of the central computer and that system response degrades as the number of users increases.
Personal computers, which have replaced timesharing as the primary mode of interactive computing, have the advantage, as one Xerox PARC researcher put it,  of not being faster at night.  Also, a collection of personal computers is more reliable than are terminals connected to a centralized computer: system problems are less apt to cause a total stoppage of work.
The disadvantages of PCs, of course, are the converse of the advantages of timesharing: Companies that use stand-alone PCs usually see a proliferation of printers, inconsistent data-bases, and non-exchangeable data.
Mouse -- An interactive computer system must provide a way for users to indicate which operations they want and what data they want those operations to be performed on.
As video display terminals became common, it became clear that it was often better for users to specify operands -- and sometimes operations -- by pointing to them on the screen.
It also became clear that graphic applications should not be controlled solely via a keyboard.
In the Sixties and Seventies, many different pointing devices were invented and tried: the light pen, the track ball, the joy stick, cursor keys, the digitizing tablet, the touch-screen, and the mouse.
Like other pointing devices, the mouse allows easy selection of objects and triggering of sensitive areas on the screen.
The mouse differs from touch screens, light pens, and digitizing pads in that it is a relative pointing device: the movement of the pointer on the screen depends upon mouse movement, rather than upon its position.
Unlike light pens, joy sticks, and digitizing pads, the mouse  and the corresponding pointer on the screen  stays put when the user lets go of it to do something else.
To achieve satisfactory mouse-tracking performance, the mouse is handled in at a very low level.
In some workstations, mouse-tracking is handled in the window system, with the result that the mouse pointer often jerks around the screen as and may even freeze for seconds at a time, depending upon what else the system is doing.
The mouse is a hand-eye-coordination device, so if the pointer lags, users just keep moving the mouse, and when the system catches up, the mouse moves beyond the user s target.
This was considered unacceptable at Xerox.
Star uses a two-button mouse, in contrast with the one-button mouse used by Apple and the three-button mouse used by most other vendors.
Though predecessors of Star developed at Xerox PARC  see History of Star Development, below  use a three-button mouse, Star s designers wanted to reduce the number of buttons to alleviate confusion over which button did what.
The functions invoked via the Alto s middle button are, in Star, invoked in other ways.
Why did Star s designers stop at two buttons instead of reducing the number to one, as Apple did?
Because studies they did involving users editing text and other material showed that a one-button mouse eliminated button-confusion errors only at the cost of increasing selection errors to unacceptable levels.
Bit-mapped display -- Until recently, most video display terminals were character-mapped.
Such displays enable vast savings in diaplay memory, which, when memory was expensive, made terminals more affordable.
In the Seventies, researchers at Xerox PARC decided that memory would get cheaper eventually and that a bit-mapped screen was worth the cost anyway.
5 inches tall.
Like the Alto, Star s display has a resolution of 72 pixels per inch.
There are two reasons why the number 72 was chosen.
First, there are 72 printer s points inch, so 72 pixels inch allows for a smooth interface with the world of typesetting and typography.
Second, 72 pixels inch is high enough resolution to allow a wide range of graphics and character sizes -- down to about eight points -- to be legible on the screen  see Fig.
1 , but not so high that the memory burden is onerous, as a screen that matched the 300 dot inch printer resolution would have been.
The pixel size and density is the same horizontally and vertically, unlike many PC graphic displays, simplifying the display software and improving image quality.
Windows -- It is now common for systems to allow several programs to display information simultaneously in separate areas of the screen, rather than each taking up the entire display.
Star was the first commercial system to provide this capability.
Some windowing systems allow windows to overlap each other.
Other systems don t: the size and position of windows are adjusted by the system as windows are opened and closed.
However, Star s designers observed in early testing that users spent a lot of time adjusting windows and usually adjusted them so that they did not overlap.
Because of this, and because Star s 17-inch screen was large enough that there wasn t as much of a need for overlapping windows as there is in systems having less screen space, the designers decided that application windows should be constrained so as not to overlap.
However, due to later recognition that there are situations in which overlapping application windows are preferable and a reduction in the standard screen size to 15 inches  with a 19-inch screen optional , the constraints were made optional in ViewPoint, Star s successor, with the default setting being that application windows can overlap one another.
Integrated applications -- This industry buzzword has been used to describe many things; here it means that text, graphics, tables, and mathematical formulae are all edited inside documents.
In many other systems, different types of content are edited in separate application windows and then cut pasted together.
For example: a MacDraw drawing put into a Microsoft Word or Aldus PageMaker document can no longer be edited; rather, the original must be re-edited with MacDraw and then substituted for the old drawing in the document.
Not even Star is fully integrated in the sense used here.
For example, though the original structured graphics editor, the new one  see History of Star Development, below , and the table and formula editors all operate inside text files, spreadsheets and freehand drawings are currently edited in separate application windows and transferred into documents, where they are no longer fully editable.
Fig.
1 -- ViewPoint screen image.
Star s bitmapped display, once unique in the market place, is now much more common.
Such a display permits WYSIWYG editing, display of proportionally-spaced fonts, integrated text and graphics, and graphical user interfaces.
Desktop Metaphor -- Star, unlike all conventional systems and many window-and-mouse-based ones, makes use of an analogy with real offices to make the system easy to learn.
This analogy is called  the Desktop metaphor .
Every user s initial view of Star is the Desktop, which resembles the top of an office desk, together with surrounding furniture and equipment.
It represents a working environment, where current projects and accessible resources reside.
On the screen are displayed pictures of familiar office objects, such as documents, folders, file drawers, in-baskets, and out-baskets.
These objects are displayed as small pictures, or icons.
The Desktop is the principal Star technique for realizing the physical office metaphor.
The icons on it are visible, concrete embodiments of the corresponding physical objects.
Star users are encouraged to think of the objects on the Desktop in physical terms.
You can move the icons around to arrange your Desktop as you wish.
Having windows and a mouse does not make a system an embodiment of the Desktop metaphor.
In a Desktop metaphor system, users deal mainly with data files, oblivious to the existence of programs.
They do not  invoke a text editor , they  open a document .
The system knows the type of each file and notifies the relevant application program when one is opened.
Such systems do not explicitly associate applications with data files; the burden of doing that -- and of making sure not to try to edit a spreadsheet file with the text editor or vice-versa -- is on users.
Star relieves users of the need to keep track of which data file goes with which application.
SunView is an example of a window system that is based upon the Tools metaphor rather than the Desktop metaphor.
Its users see a collection of application program windows, each of which is used to edit certain files.
Smalltalk-80, Cedar, and various Lisp environments also use the Tools metaphor rather than the Desktop metaphor.
This is not to say that the Desktop metaphor is superior to the Tools metaphor.
The Desktop metaphor was intended for office automation and publishing.
However, it can be argued that orienting users toward their data rather than toward application programs and employing analogies with the physical world are useful techniques in any domain.
The disadvantage of assigning data files to applications is that users sometimes want to operate on a file with a program other than its  assigned  application.
Such cases must be handled in Star in an ad hoc way, whereas systems like Unix allow almost any file to be run through a wide variety of programs.
Star s designers feel that, for its audience, the advantages of allowing users to forget about programs outweighs this disadvantage.
Generic commands -- One way to simplify a computer system is to reduce the number of commands.
Star achieves simplicity without sacrificing functionality by having a small set of generic commands apply to all types of data: Move, Copy, Open, Delete, Show Properties, and Same  Copy Properties .
These commands are invoked via dedicated function keys on Star s keyboard.
Each type of data object interprets a generic command in a way that is appropriate for it.
Delete Character, Delete Word, Delete Line, Delete Paragraph, Delete File.
Command modifiers are necessary in systems in which selection is only approximate.
Delete Word means:  delete the word that the cursor is on .
Modifiers are unnecessary in Star because exact selection of the objects of commands is easy.
In many systems, the large number of object-specific commands is made even more confusing by using single-word synonyms instead of command modifiers for similar operations on different objects.
For example, depending upon whether the object of the command is a file or text, the command to use might be Remove or Delete, Duplicate or Copy, and Find or Search, respectively.
Careful choice of the generic commands can further reduce the number of commands required.
For example, one might think it necessary to have a generic command Print for printing various things.
In Star, printing is invoked via the Copy command: users simply copy whatever they want to print to a printer icon.
No Print command is needed.
Similarly, the function Send Mail is handled via Move: by moving a document to the Out-basket.
Of course, not everything can be done via generic commands.
Some operations are object-specific.
For example, a word may be italicized, but italics is meaningless for a triangle.
In Star, object-specific operations are provided via selection-dependent  soft  function keys and via menus attached to application windows.
Direct manipulation; graphical user interface -- Traditional computer systems require users to remember and type a great deal just to control the system.
This is an impediment to learning and retention, especially by casual users.
Star s designers favored an approach that emphasizes recognition over recall, seeing and pointing over remembering and typing.
This suggested using menus rather than commands.
However, the designers wanted to go beyond a conventional menu-based approach.
They wanted users to feel that they are manipulating data directly, rather than issuing commands to the system to do it.
Star s designers also wanted to exploit the tremendous communication possibilities of the display.
They wanted to move away from strictly verbal communication.
Therefore, they based the system heavily upon principles that are now known as direct manipulation and graphical control.
Star users control the system by manipulating graphical elements on the screen, elements that represent the state of the system and data created by users.
When Star displays a directory, it -- unlike MS-DOS and Unix -- is not displaying a list of the names of the files in the directory, it is displaying the files themselves so that they can be manipulated by the user.
Users of this type of system have the feeling that they are operating upon the data directly, rather than via an agent: like fetching a book from a library shelf onesself rather than asking someone to do it.
A related principle is that the state of the system is always reflected in the display.
Nothing happens  behind the user s back.  One needn t fiddle with the system to understand what s going on; one can understand by inspection.
When everything in a computer system is visible on the screen, the display becomes reality.
Objects and actions can be understood purely in terms of their effects upon the display.
An example of this philosophy is the fact that -- unlike many window-based computer systems, even some developed at Xerox -- there are no hidden menus in Star: all available menus are marked via menu buttons.
For a more detailed explanation of Direct Manipulation, see the Sidebar .
Icons and iconic file management -- Computer users often have difficulty managing their files.
Before Star existed, a secretary at Xerox complained that she couldn t keep track of the files on her disk.
An inspection of her system revealed files named: memo, memo1, memo071479, letter, etc.
Naming things to keep track of them is bothersome enough for programmers, but completely unnatural for most people.
Star alleviates this problem partly by representing data files via pictures of office objects called icons.
Every application data file in the system has an icon representing it.
Each type of file has a characteristic icon shape.
If a user is looking for a spreadsheet, his or her eye can skip over mailboxes, printers, text documents, etc.
Furthermore, Star allows users to organize files spatially rather than via distinctive naming.
Systems having hierarchical directories, such as Unix and MS-DOS, provide an abstract sort of  spatial  file organization, but Star s approach is concrete.
Files can be kept together by putting them into a folder or simply by clumping them together on the Desktop, modeling how people organize their physical worlds.
Since data files are represented by icons, and files are distinguished by location and specified by selection rather than by name, users can use names like memo, memo1, letter, etc.
As bitmap, window, and mouse-based systems become more common, the use of the term  icon  is widening to refer to any non-textual symbol on the display.
In standard English,  icon  is a term for religious statues or pictures that are believed to contain some of the powers of the deities they represent.
It would be more consistent with its normal meaning if  icon  were reserved for objects having behavior and intrinsic properties.
Most graphical symbols and labels on computer screens are therefore not icons.
In Star, only representations of files on the Desktop and in folders, mailboxes, and file drawers are called  icons .
Few modes -- A system has modes if user-actions differ in effects or availability in different situations.
3 Though modes can be helpful in guiding users through unfamiliar procedures or for handling exceptional activities, they should be used sparingly and with care.
Star avoids modes in several ways.
In conventional systems, arguments follow commands, either on a command line or in response to prompts.
Whether a system uses Noun-Verb or Verb-Noun syntax has a lot to do with how moded it is.
In a Noun-Verb system such as Star, selecting an object prior to choosing a command does not put the system into a mode: users can decide not to invoke the command without having to  escape out  of anything or can select a different object to operate on.
Though modes are avoided in Star, it is not completely modeless.
For example, the Move and Copy commands require two arguments: the object to be moved and the final destination.
Though there are less moded ways to design Move and Copy, these functions currently require the user to select the object to be moved or copied, press the Move or Copy key, and then indicate the destination using the mouse.
While Star waits for the user to point to a destination, it is in Move or Copy mode: other uses of the mouse are precluded.
These modes are, however, relatively harmless because: 1  the state of the system is clearly indicated by the shape of the cursor, and 2  they are entered and exited by a user in the course of carrying out a single mental plan, making it unlikely that the system will be in the  wrong  mode when the user begins his or her next action.
Objects have properties -- Properties allow objects of the same type to vary in appearance, layout, and behavior.
For example, files have a Name property, characters have a Font family property, paragraphs have a Justified property.
Properties may have different types of values: The Name property of a file is a text string; the Size property of a character might be a number or a choice from a menu; the Justified property of a paragraph is either ON or OFF.
In Star, properties are displayed and changed in graphical forms called property sheets.
Property-based systems are rare.
Most computer systems, even today, allow users to set parameters for the duration of an interactive session, or for the duration of a command, but not for particular data-objects.
For example, headings in WordStar documents do not  remember  whether they are centered or not; whether a line is centered is determined by how the program was set when the line was typed.
Similarly, directories in Unix do not  remember  whether files are to be listed in alphabetical or temporal order; users must respecify which display order they want every time they invoke the ls command.
4 Indeed, many computer systems overwhelm their users with choices, commands to remember, and poorly organized output, much of which is irrelevant to what the user is trying to do.
They make no presumptions about what the user wants, and thus are designed as if all possible user actions were equally likely and as if all information generated by the system were of equal interest to the user.
Some systems diminish the problem somewhat by providing default settings of parameters to simplify tasks expected to be common.
Star goes further towards alleviating this problem by applying a principle called  progressive disclosure .
Progressive disclosure dictates that detail be hidden from users until they ask or need to see it.
Thus, Star not only provides default settings, it hides settings that users are unlikely to change until users indicate that they want to change them.
Implicit in this design are assumptions about which properties will be less frequently altered.
One place progressive disclosure is used is in property sheets.
Some objects have a large number of properties, many of which are relevant only when other properties have certain values  see Fig.
2 .
For example, on the page layout property sheet, there is no reason to display all of the properties for specifying running header content and position unless the user actually specifies that the document is to have running headers.
Another example of progressive disclosure is the fact that property displays in Star are temporary, displayed on demand.
In some systems, the properties of the current selection are displayed at all times -- via codes embedded in the text or in an area of the screen reserved for that purpose -- even though the user usually doesn t care.
Fig.
2 -- Progressive disclosure.
Star s property sheets, like the rest of the interface, make use of a principle known as  progressive disclosure  to avoid overwhelming users with information.
Usually, users don t need to see an object s properties: they only need to see and perhaps change its assigned style.
Users see an object s properties only upon request.
Also, even when a user sets a property sheet to show an object s properties, as is shown above, some information is hidden until the user asks to see it.
For example, there is no need to clutter the property sheet shown above with boxes for entering numbers for  Other  values of Line Height, Spacing Before Paragraph, or Spacing After Paragraph until the user has actually sets the property to  Other .
Thus, styles hide needless detail from users.
Consistency -- Because Star and all of its applications were designed and developed in-house, its designers had more control over its user interface than is usually the case with computer systems.
Because the designers payed close attention to detail, a very high degree of consistency was achieved.
The left mouse button always selects; the right always extends the selection.
Mouse sensitive areas always give feedback when the left button goes down, but never take effect until the button comes up.
Strong emphasis on good graphic and screen design -- Windows, icons, and property sheets are useless if users can t easily distinguish them from the background or each other, can t easily see which labels correspond to which objects, or are overwhelmed with visual clutter.
To assure that Star presents information in a maximally-perceivable and useful fashion, Xerox hired graphic designers to determine the appearance and placement of screen objects.
These designers applied various written and unwritten principles to the design of the window headers and borders, the Desktop background, the command buttons, the pop-up menus, the property sheets, and the Desktop icons.
The illusion of manipulable objects -- One goal,    fundamental to the notion of direct manipulation, is to create the    illusion of manipulable objects.
It should be clear that objects    can be selected and how to select them.
It should be obvious when    they are selected and that the next action will apply to    them.
Whereas the usual task of graphic designers is to present    information for passive viewing, Star s designers had to figure    out how to present information for manipulation as well.
This can    be seen most clearly in the Desktop icons, where there is a clear    figure ground relationship: the icons stand by themselves, with    self-contained labels.
Windows reveal in their borders the     handles  for scrolling, paging, window-specific commands and    pop-up menus.
Visual order and user focus -- One of the most obvious    contributions of good graphic design is to provide appropriate    visual order and focus to the screen.
For example, intensity and    contrast, when appropriately applied, draw the user s attention to    the most important features of the display.
In some windowing systems, window interiors have the same  dark     color as the Desktop background.
Window content should have high    intensity relative to the Desktop, to draw attention to what is    important on the screen.
In Star, window content background is    white, both for high contrast and to simulate paper.
Star keeps the amount of black on the screen to a minimum to make    the selection stand out  see Fig.
3 .
In most windowing systems,    window headers and other areas of the screen are black, making the    selection hard to find.
This principle is so important that Star s    designers made sure that the display hardware could fill the    non-addressable border of the screen with Desktop grey rather than    leaving it black as in most systems.
Star also uses icon images    that turn from mostly white to mostly black when selected  see    Fig.
4 , and allows at most one selection on the screen at a time.
Figure 3 -- Visual order and user focus.
The large amount of contrast present on the screens of many window    systems  upper screen  makes it difficult to focus on the relevant    information.
The selection should be the user s main focus: it is    the object of the next operation.
The lower screen shows how    Star ViewPoint s screen design focuses attention on the selection.
Figure 4 -- Visual order and user focus.
Four candidate sets of icons were designed and tested for Star.
A    representative sample from each set is shown here.
In Star, the    icon selected by the user to be operated on is indicated by    inverting its image.
Candidate icon sets in which the images are    mostly white allow icons to stand out when they are selected by    the user.
The set that best satisfies this criterion, the one on    the upper left, was chosen.
Revealed structure -- Often, the more powerful the    program being used, the greater the distance between intention and    effect.
If all that is displayed is effect and not intention, the    user s task of learning the connection is much more difficult.
For example, there are many ways to    determine the position and length of a line of text on a page.
It    can be done with page margins, paragraph indentations, centering,    tabs, blank lines, or spaces.
The WYSIWYG view of all these would    be identical.
That would be enough if all that mattered to the    user was the final form on paper.
But what will happen if    characters are inserted?
If the line is moved to another page,    where will it land?
WYSIWYG views are sometimes not enough.
Special views are one method of revealing structure.
In Star,    documents can show  Structure  and or  Non-Printing Characters  if    desired  see Fig.
5 .
Another convenient means for revealing    structure is to make it show up during selection.
For example,    when a rectangle is selected in a graphics frame, what highlights    it are eight control points, any of which can attach to the    cursor during Move or Copy and can land on grid points for precise alignment.
The control point    highlighting allows a user to distinguish a rectangle from four    straight lines; both might produce the same printed effect but    would respond differently to editing.
Figure 5 -- -- Revealed structure.
At the top is the WYSIWYG view of mixed text and graphics.
The    middle two panels show that structure is revealed when an object    is selected.
When a line segment is selected, its control points    are shown.
When text is selected, the text  string  is revealed.
The bottom panel shows the effect of the Show Structure and Show    Non-Printing Characters commands, which is to reveal the location    of embedded graphics and text frames  dotted lines  and  new    paragraph  and SPACE characters.
Consistent and appropriate graphic vocabulary --    Property sheets  see Fig.
2  present a form-like display for the    user to specify detailed property settings and arguments to    commands.
They were designed with a consistent graphic vocabulary.
All of the user s targets are in boxes; unchangeable information    such as a property name is not boxed.
Mutually exclusive values    within choice parameters are shown with boxes adjacent.
Independent  on off  or state parameters are shown with    boxes separated.
The current settings are shown inverted.
Some of    the menus display graphic symbols rather than text.
Finally, there    are text parameters consisting of a box into which text or    numbers can be typed, copied or moved, and within which text    editing functions are available.
Match the medium -- It is in this last principle that    the sensitivities of a good graphic designer are most apparent.
The goal is to create a consistent quality in the graphics that is    appropriate to the product and makes the most of the given medium.
Star has a large black and white display.
The solutions the    graphics designers devised might have been very different had the    display had grey-scale or color pixels.
A common problem with raster displays is  jaggies : diagonal lines    appearing as staircases.
With careful design, jaggies can be    avoided, for example, by using only vertical, horizontal, and    45-degree angles.
Also important is controlling how the edges of    the figures interact with the texture of the ground.
Figure 6    shows how edges are carefully matched to the background texture so    that they have a consistent quality appearance.
Fig.
6 -- Desktop grey.
25% grey pattern designed to reduce flicker and provide background texture.
WYSIWYG document editor -- Within the limits of screen resolution, Star documents are displayed as they will be printed, including typographic features such as boldface, italics, proportional spacing, variable font families, superscripts, and layout features such as embedded graphics, page numbers, headers, and footers.
This is commonly referred to as  What You See Is What You Get , or  WYSIWYG .
Star adheres to this principle even in domains where other  WYSIWYG  document editors do not.
For example, mathematical formulae are created and edited in documents using a WYSIWYG editor that has knowledge built into it about the appearance and layout of mathematical symbols.
A square root sign has a slot for an expression, and grows when the expression becomes large  see Fig.
7 .
1, n,  x*3  2    to represent the formula that will eventually be printed.
Formulae created with such systems usually require several print-edit cycles to get right.
Fig.
7 -- WYSIWYG formula editing.
Mathematical formulae are edited in Star in a highly-WYSIWYG fashion, in contrast to most systems, in which formulae are specified via in-line expressions or by constructing them from pieces in a special character font.
ASCII or EBCDIC .
The Star character set is a superset of ASCII.
The reason for a sixteen bit code is a strong market requirement for enhanced multilingual capabilility coming from Xerox s subsidiaries in Europe and Japan.
Most systems provide non-English characters via different fonts, so that the eight-bit  extended  ASCII codes might be rendered as math symbols in one font, Greek letters in another font, and Arabic in yet another.
This has the effect that when any application loses track of font information while handling the text  which happens often in some systems , a paragraph of Arabic may turn into nonsensical Greek or math symbols or something else, and vice-versa.
Star uses sixteen-bit character codes to permit the system to reliably handle European languages and also Japanese, which uses many thousands of characters.
All Star and ViewPoint systems have French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian language capabilities built in.
S.
Since that time, many more characters have been added, covering Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, and nearly all European languages.
5,6,7 Clever typing schemes and sophisticated rendering algorithms are required to provide a multilingual capability that satisfies customers.
The document is the heart of the world, and unifies it -- Most personal computers and workstations give no special status to any particular application.
Dozens of applications are available, most of which are incompatible with each other in data format as well as user interface.
Star, in contrast, assumes that the primary use of the system is to create and maintain documents.
The document editor is thus the primary application.
All other applications exist mainly to provide or manipulate information whose ultimate destination is a document.
Thus, most applications are integrated into the document editor  see Integrated applications, above , operating within frames embedded in documents, and those applications that are not part of the document editor support transfer of their data to documents.
Having described what Star and ViewPoint are, we will describe where they came from and how they were developed.
Fig.
8 graphs this history, showing systems that influenced Star and those that were influenced by it.
Fig.
8 -- How systems influenced later systems.
This graph summarizes how various systems related to Star have influenced one another over the years.
Time progresses downwards.
Many  influence arrows  are due to key designers changing jobs or applying concepts from their graduate research to products.
Although Star was conceived as a product in 1975 and was released in 1981, many of the ideas that went into it were born in projects dating back over three decades.
D.
Roosevelt s science advisors, wrote an article describing his vision of the uses of electronics and information technology.
At a time when computers were new, room-sized, and used only for military number-crunching, Bush envisioned a personal, desktop computer for non-numerical applications, and called it the Memex.
Due to insufficient technology and insufficient imagination on the part of others, Bush s ideas languished for fifteen years.
SketchPad -- In the Sixties, people began to take interactive computing seriously.
One such person was Ivan Sutherland.
He built an interactive graphics system called Sketchpad that allowed a user to create graphical figures on a CRT display using a light pen.
The geometric shapes users put on the screen were treated as objects: after being created, they could be moved, copied, shrunk, expanded, and rotated.
They could also be joined together to make larger, more complex objects that could then be operated upon as units.
Sketchpad influenced Star s user interface as a whole as well as its graphics applications.
NLS -- Also in the Sixties, Douglas Engelbart established a research program at Stanford Research Institute  now called SRI International  for exploring the use of computers  to augment the knowledge worker  and human intellect in general.
He and his collegues experimented with different types of displays and input devices -- inventing the mouse when other pointing devices proved inadequate -- and developed a system commonly known as NLS.
2 * NLS was unique in several respects.
It used CRT displays when most computers used teletypes.
It was full-screen-oriented when the few systems that were interactive were line-oriented.
It used a mouse when all other graphic interactive systems used cursor keys, light pens, joy sticks, or digitizing tablets.
Finally, it was the first system to organize textual and graphical information in trees and networks, which today would be called an  idea processor  or a  hypertext system .
The Reactive Engine -- While Engelbart et al were developing ideas, some of which eventually found their way into Star, Alan Kay, then a graduate student, was doing likewise.
His dissertation, The Reactive Engine, contained seeds of many ideas that he and others later brought to fruition in the Smalltalk language and programming environment, which, in turn, influenced Star.
Like the designers of NLS, Kay realized that interactive applications do not have to treat the display as a  glass teletype  and can share the screen with other programs.
Xerox s planned expansion into the office systems business.
The Palo Alto Research Center  abbreviated  PARC   was organized into several laboratories, each devoted to basic and applied research in a field related to the above goals.
The names and organization of the labs have changed over the years, but the research topics have stayed the same: materials science, laser physics, integrated circuitry, CAD CAM, user interface  not necessarily to computers , and computer science  including networking, databases, operating systems, languages and programming environments, graphics, document production systems, and artificial intelligence .
Alto -- PARC researchers were fond of the slogan:  The best way to predict the future is to invent it.  After some initial experiments with time-shared systems, they began searching for a new approach to computing.
Among the founding members of PARC was Alan Kay.
He and his collegues were acquainted with NLS and liked its novel approach to human-computer interaction.
Soon, PARC hired several people who had worked on NLS and in 1971 signed an agreement with SRI licensing Xerox to use the mouse.
Kay and others were dedicated to a vision of personal computers in a distributed environment.
In fact, they coined the term  personal computer  in 1973, long before microcomputers started what has been called the  personal computer revolution .
One result of the search for a new approach was the Alto  see Fig 9 .
5 mega-byte hard disk pack  floppy disks did not exist at the time  and 128 to 256 kbytes of memory.
Unlike most machines of its day, the Alto also had a microprogrammable instruction set, a  full-page   10 1 2 x 8 1 4 inch; 600 x 800 pixel  bitmapped graphic display, about 50 kbytes of high-speed display memory, and a mouse.
The first Alto was operational in 1972.
At first, only a half-dozen or so Altos were built.
After software that exploited the Alto s capabilities became available, demand for them grew tremendously, spreading beyond PARC into Xerox as a whole and even to external customers.
Eventually, over a thousand Altos were built.
Ethernet -- Another product of the new approach was the Ethernet.
With its standardized, layered communications protocols, Ethernet provides a way of connecting computers much more flexibly than had been previously possible.
Soon after the first Altos were built, they were networked together.
Eventually, the network grew to thousands of workstations  Altos and Alto-successors  within Xerox s worldwide organization, giving Xerox millions of person-hours of experience with networked personal computers and servers.
Smalltalk -- Alan Kay had been one of the main advocates of the Alto.
His Learning Research Group  LRG  began using the Alto to build prototypes for a personal computing system  of the future : a portable machine that would provide -- rather than a canned set of applications -- the building blocks necessary for users to build the tools and applications they need to solve their own information processing problems.
The technologies needed to build a lap computer with the power of the  DynaBook   as the envisioned system was called  were unavailable at the time, and still are.
The prototypes developed by Kay s group evolved into the Smalltalk language and programming environment.
They further promoted the notion of personal computing, pioneered complete, interactive programming environments, and refined and solidified concepts of object-oriented programming that had been extant only in vestigial form in previous systems.
Most importantly for Star, they demonstrated the power of graphical, bitmapped displays, mouse-driven input, windows, and simultaneous applications.
This is the most visible link between Smalltalk and Star, and is perhaps why many people wrongly believe that Star was written in Smalltalk.
Pygmalion -- The first large program to be written in Smalltalk was Pygmalion, the doctoral thesis project of David Smith.
One goal of Pygmalion was to show that programming a computer does not have to be primarily a textual activity: it can be accomplished, given the appropriate system, by interacting with graphical elements on a screen.
The idea of using icons -- images that allow users to manipulate them and in so doing act upon the data they represent -- came mainly from Pygmalion.
After completing Pygmalion, Smith worked briefly on the NLS project at SRI before joining the Star development team at Xerox.
Bravo, Gypsy, and BravoX -- At the same time that LRG was developing Smalltalk for the Alto, others at PARC, mainly Charles Simonyi and Butler Lampson, were writing an advanced document editing system for it: Bravo.
Because it made heavy use of the Alto s bitmapped screen, Bravo was unquestionably the most WYSIWYG text editor of its day, with on-screen underlining, boldfacing, italics, variable font families and sizes, and variable-width characters.
It allowed the screen to be split, so that different documents or different parts of the same document could be edited at once, but did not operate in a windowed environment as we use the term today.
Bravo was widely-used at PARC and in Xerox as a whole.
In 1976-78, Simonyi and others rewrote Bravo, incorporating many of the new user-interface ideas floating around PARC at the time.
One such idea was modelessness, promoted by Larry Tesler3 and exemplified in Telser s prototype text editor Gypsy.
They also added styles, enhancing users  ability to control the appearance of their documents.
The new version was called BravoX.
Shortly thereafter, Simonyi joined Microsoft, where he led the development of Microsoft Word, a direct descendent of BravoX.
Another member of the BravoX team, Tom Malloy, went to Apple and wrote LisaWrite.
Alto and later machines.
Draw, by Patrick Beaudelaire and Bob Sproull, and SIL  for Simple Illustrator  were intellectual successors of Sutherland s Sketchpad  see above : graphical object editors that allowed users to construct figures out of selectable, movable, stretchable geometric forms and text.
In turn, Star s graphic frames capability is in large measure an intellectual successor of Draw and SIL.
William Newman in BCPL for the Alto.
Flyer was another paint program, written in Smalltalk for the Alto by Bob Flegel and Bill Bowman.
These programs inspired Doodle, a paint program written for a later machine by Dan Silva.
Doodle eventually evolved into ViewPoint s Free-Hand Drawing application.
Silva went on to write DeluxePaint, a paint program for PCs.
Laser Printing -- Fancy graphics capabilities in a workstation are of little use without hardcopy capability to match it.
Laser printing, invented at PARC, provided the necessary base capability, but a way was needed for computers to describe output to laser printers in a uniform way.
For this purpose, Bob Sproull developed the Press page-description language.
Press was heavily used at PARC, then further developed into Interpress, Xerox s product page-description language and the language in which Star encodes printer output.
Some of the developers of Interpress later formed Adobe Systems and developed Postscript, a popular page description language.
Laurel and Hardy -- A network of personal workstations suggests electronic mail.
Though electronic mail was not invented at PARC, PARC researchers  mainly Doug Brotz  made it user-friendly for the first time by creating Laurel, a display-oriented tool for sending, receiving, and organizing e-mail.
The experience of using Laurel, which was named after a tree, inspired others to write Hardy, named after Laurel, for an Alto successor machine.
Laurel and Hardy were instrumental in getting non-engineers at Xerox to use e-mail.
The use of e-mail spread further when Star and ViewPoint spread throughout Xerox.
Today, Xerox employees depend heavily upon the company s global e-mail network for communication, both work-related and otherwise, with other employees.
OfficeTalk -- One more Alto program that influenced Star was OfficeTalk, a prototype office automation system written by Clarence  Skip  Ellis and Gary Nutt.
OfficeTalk supported standard office automation tasks and tracked  jobs  as they went from person to person in an organization.
Experience with OfficeTalk provided ideas for Star because of the two systems  similar target applications.
Alto served as a valuable prototype for Star.
Alto users have had several thousand work-years of experience with them over a period of eight years, making Alto perhaps the largest prototyping effort in history.
There were dozens of experimental programs written for the Alto by members of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
Without the creative ideas of the authors of these systems, Star in its present form would have been impossible.
To develop Star and other office systems products, Xerox created the Systems Development Department  SDD .
SDD was staffed by transferring people from other parts of Xerox, including PARC, as well as by hiring from outside.
Thus, contrary to what has often been stated in the industry press, Star was not developed at PARC, but rather in a separate product development organization.
When SDD was formed, a decision was made to use Mesa, an  industrial-strength  dialect of Pascal that had been conceived at SRI and further developed at PARC, as the primary product programming language.
SDD took over development and maintenance of Mesa from the Computer Science Laboratory  CSL  at PARC, freeing CSL to develop Mesa s research successor, Cedar.
Star Hardware -- Star is often discussed as if it were a computer.
In fact, Star is a body of software.
3 * However, using the name Star to refer to the machine is understandable since the machine was designed in conjunction with the software to meet the needs of the software design.
This is in sharp contrast to the usual approach, in which software is designed for existing computers.
The 8000-series workstation was based upon a microcoded processor that was designed within Xerox especially to run the object code produced by the Mesa compiler.
Besides being microprogrammed to run Mesa, the processor provided low-level operations for facilitating display operations.
For example, the BitBlt operation for manipulating rectangular arrays of screen pixels is implemented as a single instruction.
5 Mbytes , a local hard disk  10, 29, or 40 Mbytes , a 17-inch display, a mechanical mouse, an eight-inch floppy disk drive, and an Ethernet connection.
The price was initially $16,500 with software.
Even though the machine was designed to run Star, it also ran other software.
In addition to selling it as the 8010  Star  workstation, Xerox sold it as a server machine and as an Interlisp and a Smalltalk workstation.
Star Software -- Alhough Star incorporated ideas from a number of predecessors, it still required a mammoth design effort to pull all of those ideas -- as well as new ideas -- together to produce a coherent design.
1 About thirty person-years went into the design of the user interface, functionality, and hardware.
To foster uniformity of specifications as well as thoughtful and uniform design, Star s designers developed a strict format for specifications.
Applications and system features were to be described in terms of the objects that users would manipulate via the software and the actions that the software provided for manipulating objects.
This  objects and actions  analysis was supposed to be at a fairly high level, without regard to how the objects would actually be presented or how the actions would actually be invoked by users.
A full specification was then written from the  objects and actions  version.
This approach forced designers to think clearly about the purpose of each application or feature and fostered recognition of similar operations across specifications, allowing what might have seemed like new operations to be handled via existing commands.
When SDD was formed, it was split between two locations: Southern California  El Segundo  and Northern California  Palo Alto .
Few people were willing to transfer one way or the other, leaving SDD with the choice of losing many competent engineers or being creative.
SDD s management took the creative route: they put the Ethernet to work, putting the development machines at both sites onto a network, connecting the two sites via a 56 kbit second leased line, encouraging heavy use of electronic mail for work-related communication, and developing tools for facilitating distributed, multi-party development.
As might be expected from Star s origins, most of the design and prototyping work was done in Palo Alto, whereas most of the implementation was done in El Segundo.
Though this split was handled creatively, some of Star s designers now believe it caused problems that were not overcome by extensive use of e-mail.
For example, the implementors did not benefit from much of the prototyping that had been done at PARC.
The development process has been recounted in detail elsewhere6 and will not be repeated here.
Star Functional Specification    unimplemented.
Since the machine upon which Star ran was developed in parallel with the software, it was not available early-on to be used as a software development platform.
Early prototyping and development was done on Altos and successor research machines developed at PARC.
Though the Mesa language ran on these machines, development aids for Mesa programmers were lacking.
When the 8000-series workstation was available, the systems group within SDD began developing a suitable development environment.
When it became available, the development environment, known internally as Tajo and externally as Xerox Development Environment  XDE , and the numerous tools written to run in it were quickly adopted by programmers throughout SDD.
As Star was improved later, many good ideas from Tajo were adopted.
ViewPoint Software -- Soon after Star was released, the designers and implementers realized that it had serious problems from a performance, maintenance, and enhancement standpoint.
Its high degree of integration and user-interface consistency had been achieved by making it monolithic: the system  knew  about all applications and all parts of the system  knew  about all other parts.
It was difficult to correct problems, add new features, and increase performance.
The monolithic architecture also did not lend itself to distributed, multi-party development.
This created pressure to rewrite Star.
Bob Ayers, who had been heavily involved in the development of Star, rewrote the infrastructure of the system according to the more flexible Tajo model.
He built, on top of the operating system and low-level window manager, a  toolkit  for building Star-like applications.
Transfer of data between different applications was handled in the new infrastructure via strict protocols involving the user s selection, thus making applications independent from one another.
The object-oriented user interface, which requires that the system associate applications with data files, was preserved by having applications register themselves with the system when started, telling it which type of data file they correspond to and registering procedures for handling keyboard and mouse events and generic commands.
User-interface consistency was fostered by building many of the standards into the application toolkit.
The development organization completed the toolkit and then ported or rewrote the existing applications and utilities to run on top of it.
To underscore the fact that the new system was a substantial improvement over the old, the name was changed from Star to ViewPoint.
0 was released in 1985.
ViewPoint Hardware -- In addition to revising the software, Xerox brought the hardware up to date by designing a completely new vehicle for ViewPoint: the 6085 workstation.
The new machine was designed to take advantage of advances in integrated circuitry, reductions in memory costs, new disk technologies, and new standards in keyboard design, as well as to provide IBM PC compatibility.
The 6085 workstation has a Mesa processor plus an optional IBM-PC-compatible processor, one megabyte of real memory  expandable to 4 megabytes , a hard disk  10 - 80 megabytes , a choice of a 15- or a 19-inch display, an optical mouse, a new keyboard, a 5 1 4 inch floppy disk drive, and, of course, an Ethernet connection.
The base cost was initially $6340 with the ViewPoint software.
Like the 8010, the 6085 is sold as a vehicle for Interlisp and Smalltalk as well as for ViewPoint.
0 has recently been released, adding many features relevant to desktop publishing.
Stylesheets, for facilitating control of document appearance.
Partly out of excitement over what they were doing, PARC researchers and Star s designers didn t pay enough attention to the  other  personal computer revolution that was occurring outside of Xerox.
Star s designers to the need to approach the market via cheap, stand-alone PCs.
The result was a product that was highly unfamiliar.
Nowadays, of course, such systems are no longer unusual.
Developing Star and ViewPoint involved developing several enabling technologies, for networking, communicating with servers, describing pages to laser printers, and software development.
At the time they were developed, these technologies were unique in the industry.
Xerox elected to keep them proprietary for fear of losing its competitive advantage.
With hindsight, we can say that it may have been better to release these technologies into the public domain, or at least to market them early, so that they would become industry standards.
Instead, alternative approaches developed at other companies have become the industry standards.
Open Look  indicates its desire to reverse this trend.
The personal computer revolution has shown that it is futile to try to anticipate all of the applications that customers will want.
Star should have been designed to be open and extensible by users from the start, as the Alto was.
In hindsight, extensibility was one of the keys to the Alto s popularity.
The problem wasn t that Star lacked functionality, it was that it didn t have the functionality customers wanted.
An example is the initial lack of a spreadsheet application.
The designers failed to appreciate the significance of this application, which may have been more important even than word-processing in expanding the personal computer revolution beyond engineers and hobbyists into business.
Eventually realizing that Star s closedness was a problem, Xerox replaced it with ViewPoint, a more  open  system that allows users to pick and choose applications that they need, including a spreadsheet and IBM PC software.
Apple Computer learned the same lesson with its Lisa computer, and similarly replaced it with a cheaper one having a more open software architecture: Macintosh.
Star s initial per-workstation price was near that of time-shared mini-computers, dedicated word-processors, and other shared computing facilities.
Star was, however, competing for desktop space with micro-computer-based PCs.
ViewPoint has corrected that problem: The 6085 costs about the same as its competition.
Star s designers should have established performance goals, documented them in the functional specifications, and stuck to them as Star was being developed.
Where performance goals couldn t be met, the corresponding functionality should have been cut.
In lieu of speed, the user-interface should have been designed to be more responsive.
By designing the system to handle user input more intelligently, systems can be made more responsive without necessarily making them execute functions faster.
ViewPoint now makes use of background processes to increase its responsiveness.
Having a development organization that was split between Palo Alto and El Segundo was probably a mistake, less for reasons of distance per se than for lack of shared background in  PARC-style  computing.
However, the adverse effect of sheer distance upon communication was certainly a factor.
Direct Manipulation and the Desktop metaphor aren t the best way to do everything.
Remembering and typing is sometimes better than seeing and pointing.
For example, if a user wants to open a file that is one of several hundred in a directory  folder , the system should let users type its name rather than forcing them to scroll through the directory trying to spot it so they can select it.
Though there are aspects of Star that perhaps should have been done differently, most of the aspects of Star s design described at the beginning of this article have withstood the test of time.
Iconic, direct-manipulation, object-oriented user interface -- The days of cryptic command languages and scores of commands for users to remember  a la Unix and MS-DOS  should have passed long ago.
Generic commands and consistency in general -- Even Macintosh could use some lessons in this regard: it uses Duplicate for copying files within a disk but dragging of icons for copying them across disks, not to mention Copy-Paste for copying anything else.
Pointing device -- Although cursor keys have some advantages and certainly would have enhanced Star s market appeal  as they have ViewPoint s , Star s designers stand by the system s primary reliance on the mouse.
This does not imply a commitment to the mouse per se, but rather to any pointing device that allows quick pointing and selection.
As interfaces evolve in the future, high-resolution touch screens and other more exotic devices may replace mice as the pointing devices of choice.
High-resolution display -- Memory is now cheap: the    justification for character displays is gone.
Good graphic design -- Screen graphics designed by computer    programmers will not satisfy customers.
The Star designers    recognized their limitations in this regard and hired the right    people for the job.
As color displays gain market presence, the    participation of graphic designers will be even more crucial.
ASCII .
Star and ViewPoint s use of a 16-bit character set and of    special typing and rendering algorithms for foreign languages is    the correct approach.
Distributed, personal computing -- Though the reorientation of    the industry away from batch and time-shared computing toward    personal computing had nothing to do with Xerox, PARC, or Star, it    was an important part of the computing philosophy that led to    Star.
Star has had an indisputable influence on the design of computer systems.
Byte: Do you have a Xerox Star here that you work with?
Telser: No, we didn t have one here.
We went to the NCC when the Star was announced and looked at it.
And in fact it did have an immediate impact.
A few months after looking at it we made some changes to our user interface based on ideas that we got from it.
For example, the desktop manager we had before was completely different; it didn t use icons at all, and we never liked it very much.
We decided to change ours to the icon base.
That was probably the only thing we got from Star, I think.
Elements of the Desktop metaphor approach can also be seen in many other systems.
The history presented here has shown, however, that Star s designers did not invent the system out of nothingness.
Just as it has influenced systems that came after it, Star was influenced by ideas and systems that came before it.
It is difficult to inhibit the spread of good ideas once they are apparent to all, especially in this industry.
Star was thus just one step -- albeit an important one -- in an evolutionary process that will continue both at Xerox and elsewhere.
That is how it should be.

When Star was announced, several articles on it appeared in trade magazines, journals, and at conferences.
Many of these were reprinted in the Xerox publication Office Systems Technology  see Bibliography .
Since then, several more articles have been published that are relevant to this retrospective.
They include an article from MacWorld 48 that describes the historical antecedents of Apple Computer s Lisa and Macintosh computers, which share much of Star s history.
This retrospective owes a great deal to those previous writings.
We also acknowledge the valuable contributions that Joe Becker, Bill Mallgren, Doug Carothers, Linda Bergsteinsson, and Randy Polen of Xerox Corporation, Bob Ayers, Ralph Kimball, Dave Fylstra, and John Shoch made to this retrospective.

There was a second system called Off-Line System  abbreviated FLS , hence NLS s strange abbreviation.
NLS is now marketed by McDonnell-Douglas under the name Augment.
3 * The official name for Star was    the Xerox 8010 Information System.
The machine was called the 8000 Series Network Systems Processor.

Who invented the internet?
Wall Street Journal columnist L.
Gordon Crovitz took a stab at this question on Monday and settled on Xerox — the copier company whose research and development group, Xerox PARC, invented just about everything people like about the personal computer.
Crovitz’s argument?
Well, Xerox had to cook up the internet, because it couldn’t wait for those dithering government researchers to make it happen.
Xerox hired Robert Taylor, the guy who ran the Department of Defense’s ARPA  Advanced Research Projects Agency  Information Processing Technologies program in the 1960s to run Xerox PARC’s computer lab.
Crovitz writes, adding: “Full credit goes to the company where Mr.
Xerox maintains a decade-by-decade list of its technological accomplishments on its website.
And while it’s eager to take credit for Ethernet, the graphical user interface, and the PC, Xerox doesn’t take credit for the internet.
Why not?
Robert Metcalfe, researcher at PARC, invented Ethernet as a way to connect Xerox printers and the Alto computer,” Xerox spokesman Bill McKee said on Monday.
In other words, don’t confuse a network of computers with the birthplace of TCP IP and lolcats.
To be fair, Xerox invented a lot more than just Ethernet.
And many of the things that came out of Xerox — the PC and the graphical user interface — were crucial to the internet as we know it today, according to Robert Taylor, who we interviewed Monday.
To hear Taylor tell it, finding the inventor of the internet is a bit like finding the inventor of the blues.
Its origins are murky and complex.
The origins of the internet include work both sponsored by the government and Xerox PARC, so you can’t say that the internet was invented by either one alone,” he says.
So would the internet have been invented without the government?
That’s a tough question,” he says.
Private industry does not like to start brand new directions in technology.
Private industry is conservative by nature.
So the ARPAnet probably could not have been built by private industry.
In fact, Taylor says, the two biggest computer and telecommunications companies back in the 1960s were pretty hostile to two of the big ideas behind the internet: time-sharing computing  IBM liked batch processing  and packet switching  AT&T liked circuit switching .
Both AT&T and IBM were invited to join the ARPAnet and they both refused,” he says.
Michael Hiltzik, the LA Times journalist who wrote the definitive biography of Xerox PARC, Dealers of Lightning, provides a definitive debunking of Crovitz’s argument here.
Butler W.
Lampson  left photo , the visioneer of Xerox Alto and Charles P.
If any computer in this section deserves the label  remarkable , it is namely the Xerox Alto, developed at Xerox PARC  Palo Alto Research Center  in 1972.
Why?
The Alto greatly influenced the design of personal computers in the following decades, notably the Macintosh and the first Sun workstations.
It was not a commercial product, but several thousand units were built and were heavily used at PARC, other Xerox facilities, and at several famous universities for many years.
It was not typically purchased by someone working based upon a personal budget.
The Alto was the first system to bring together all of the components of the modern Graphical User Interface  GUI .
I was the first to implement the LAN technology, named Ethernet.
The first WYSIWYG word processor was produced for the Alto.
The Alto was first conceived in a December 1972 memorandum written by the PARC scientist and manager Butler Lampson  see the Memorandum for Xerox Alto  , who requests support from the Xerox Corporation for the construction of a number of Alto personal workstations.
Alto was inspired by the On-Line System  NLS  produced by Douglas Engelbart at Stanford Research Institute  SRI , and was configured primarily by Chuck Thacker, the project leader.
Manufacturing was sub-contracted to Clement Designlabs, whose team included Carl J.
Clement, Ken Campbell and Fred Stengel.
An initial run of 80 units was produced by Designlabs  initially an Alto cost some $10000 to build , working with Tony Ciuffini and Rick Nevinger at Xerox El Segundo, who were responsible for installing the Alto’s electronics.
Due to the success of the pilot run, the team went on to produce approximately 2000 units over the next ten years.
Development proceeded for the Alto for most of the 1970s, contributing progressive new features in hardware and software.
The PARC Altos were connected together in a local area network, using a new networking technology named Ethernet.
Early software for the Alto was written in the BCPL programming language, and later in the Mesa and Smalltalk programming languages, which were not widely used outside PARC, but influenced several later languages, such as Modula  see the Users Handbook of Xerox Alto  .
The brain of Alto was a bit-slice processor based on the Texas Instruments  74181 chip, a ROM control store with a writable control store extension and 128  expandable to 512  kB of main memory.
5 MB single-platter cartridge  manufactured by Diablo Systems, a company Xerox later bought , all housed in a cabinet about the size of a small refrigerator.
The Alto s CPU was a very innovative microcoded processor, which used microcode for most of the I O functions, rather than hardware.
The microcode machine had 16 tasks, one of which executed the normal instruction set, with the others used for the display, memory refresh, disk, network, and other I O functions.
The input devices of Alto were a custom detachable keyboard, a three-button mouse , an optional 5-key chord keyset, as well as several other I O devices—a TV camera, the Hy-Type daisywheel printer and a parallel port, although these were quite rare.
The mouse and chord keyset had been introduced by SRI s On-Line System; while the mouse was an instant success among Alto users, the chord keyset never became popular.
In the early mice, the buttons were three narrow bars, arranged top to bottom rather than side to side.
The motion was sensed by two wheels perpendicular to each other.
These were soon replaced with ball-type mice.
These were photo-mechanical mice—first using white light and then using IR to count the rotations of wheels inside the mouse.
The keyboard was interesting in that each key was represented as a separate bit in a set of registers.
The keyboard registers were used as the address on the disk to boot from, and by holding specific keys down while pressing the boot button, different microcode and operating systems could be loaded.
This gave rise to the expression  nose boot  where the keys needed to boot for a test OS release required more fingers than you could come up with.
Nose boots were made obsolete by the  move2keys  program that shifted files on the disk so that a specified key sequence could be used.

House of Representatives, the Atlantic Richfield Company, and the Santa Clara, California, and the offices of Xerox s copier sales division.
Xerox donated a total of 50 Altos to outstanding universities—Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and University of Rochester, including IFS file servers  the file server was a common application for the machine  and Dover laser printers.
Xerox management rejected creating a commercially obtainable version of the Alto for many years.
The Xerox Star, the first commercial product to use many of the Alto s ideas was released in 1981, just prior to the first IBM PC, at the cost of $16000, but it was too late.
If full vector graphics and the custom hardware needed for systems like NLS Augment was too expensive for general use, character VDTs were too crude.
Today s nethack 6  game, run on a color terminal emulator or console, is well representative of the best that advanced VDTs of the late 1970s could do.
They hinted at what was possible in visual-interface design, but proved inadequate themselves.
There were several reasons character VDTs came up short that bear on issues still relevant to today s UI designers.
One problem was the absence of an input device that was well matched to the graphics display capability; several early attempts, such as light pens, graphic tablets, and even joysticks, proved unsatisfactory.
Another was that it proved difficult to push enough bits per second over the line to do serious graphics.
Even after VDTs acquired the capability to write pixels as well as formed characters, running GUIs on them remained impractical because serial lines had a peak throughput far too low to support frequent screen repainting.
For reasonable update speed, graphics displays really need to be coupled more closely to the machine that is doing the rendering than a serial connection will allow.
This is especially true if one needs to support the kind of high interactivity and frequently changing displays characteristic of games or GUIs; for this, only direct memory access will do.
Thus, the invention of the GUI had to wait until developments in silicon integrated circuits dropped the cost of computing power enough that a capable processor could be associated with each display, and the combination had become sufficiently inexpensive that machines could be dedicated to individuals  use.
The other missing piece was Engelbart s invention of the mouse — and, just as significantly, the visible mouse pointer.
This more controllable inversion of the large, crude early trackballs meant that users could have a repertoire of two-dimensional input gestures to match the two-dimensional screen.
It made interfaces based on direct visual manipulation of objects on-screen feasible for the first time.
The Xerox Alto.
The input device on the left appears to be a touch tablet, a mouse alternative similar to the trackpads on modern portables.
NLS Augment had shown what was possible, but the engineering tradition behind today s GUIs was born at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center  PARC  around the same time character-cell VDTs were becoming generally available in the rest of the world.
Inspired by Engelbart s 1968 demo, in 1973 the PARC researchers built a pioneering machine called the Alto that featured a bit-mapped display and a mouse.
It wasn t called either a “workstation” or a “personal computer”, but it was to become a direct ancestor of both.
From today s post-Alto point of view, screen shots of the Alto UI show a curious mix of modernity and crudity.
What s present are all the logical components of GUIs as we know them — icons, windows, scrollbars, sliders, and the like.
The main GUI element missing, in fact, is the pull-down menu  introduced by the Apple Lisa in 1979 .
What s missing, most conspicuously, is color.
Also, the pseudo-3D sculptural effects of modern GUI buttons and other impedimenta are missing; the widgets are flat outline boxes, and the whole resembles nothing so much as an etch-a-sketch drawing of a modern interface.
It s a little sobering to reflect that most of what we have learned to add to GUIs since 1973 is eye candy.
1974 .
It was not until the early 1980s that the implications of the PARC work would escape the laboratory and start to really transform human-computer interaction.
There is no shortage of good accounts of that transformation, but most of them tend to focus on personal computers and the history of Apple, giving scant notice to the way the change interacted with and affected the Unix tradition.
After 1990, however, and especially after 2000, the stories of Unix, the PC, and the GUI began to re-converge in ways that would have deeply surprised most of their early partisans.
Today, a Unix-centered take on the history of user interfaces, even GUIs, turns out to be a much less parochial view than one might have supposed ten or even five years ago.
The entire story is a marvelous lesson for user-interface designers in how design innovation doesn t happen in a vacuum.
UI design is no more separable than other forms of engineering and art from the accidents of history and the constraints of economics; understanding the complex and erratic way that we got where we are may be a real help to readers who want to think about their design problems not simply as exercises but as responses to human needs.
One skein of the story begins with the internal developments at Xerox PARC.
The Alto begat the Dolphin, Dorado, Dandilion, Dragon, and Danditiger  an upgrade of the Dandilion .
These “D-machines” were a series of increasingly powerful computers designed to exchange information over a prototype Ethernet.
They had bitmapped displays and three-button mice.
They featured a GUI built around overlapping windows, first implemented on the Alto as a workaround for the small size of its display.
They had early connections to the ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet.
These machines were tremendously influential.
Word of them spread through the computer-science community, challenging other groups of designers to achieve similarly dramatic capabilities.
Famously, in 1979 Steve Jobs was inspired to start the line of development  that led to the Apple Macintosh after visiting PARC and seeing the Alto and D-machines in action there.
Less often told is that Jobs had been  pre-primed for his epiphany by Apple employee Jef Raskin, whose 1967 thesis had inspired some of the PARC research.
Raskin had  a keen interest in advanced UI design and wanted to find some of the PARC concepts a home at Apple so he could continue pursuing them.
One of the effects of the Alto was to popularize bit-mapped rather than vector-graphics displays.
Most earlier graphics hardware had been designed to explicitly draw points, lines, arcs, and formed characters on a display, an approach which was relatively slow but economical because it required a minimum of expensive memory.
The Alto approach was to hang the expense and drive each screen pixel from a unique location in a memory map.
In this model almost all graphics operations could be implemented by copying blocks of data between locations in memory, a technique named BitBlt by its inventors at PARC.
BitBlt simplified graphics programming enormously and played a vital role in making the Alto GUI feasible.
The very first commercialization of this technology seems to have been a machine called the Perq aimed primarily at scientific laboratories.
The Perq s dates are difficult to pin down, but an early sales brochure  seems to establish that these machines were already being sold in August 1979; other sources claim that due to production delays they first shipped in November 1980.
The Perq design featured the same style of portrait-mode high resolution display as the Alto.
It was quite a powerful machine for its time, using a microcoded bit-slice processor with a dedicated BitBlt instruction, and some Perqs remained in use as late as 2001.
It supported at least five operating systems, including  later in the 1980s  at least three in the Unix family.
Curiously, however, the designers seem to have discarded the mouse and retained only the touch tablet.
The inventors of Unix at Bell Labs were not slow to take notice of the Alto and its BitBlt technique.
In 1981 they built a machine originally called the “Jerq” and later renamed to “Blit” at management insistance.
Like the Alto the Blit had a mouse, a bit-mapped screen, and a powerful local processor  in this case, a Motorola 68000 .
Unlike the Alto or Perq, it was designed to act as a smart terminal to a Unix minicomputer rather than for a network communicating directly with peer machines.
This difference in architecture reflected a basic difference in aims.
While the PARC crew was free to reinvent the world, the Unix developers had history they were not interested in discarding.
Plan 9, their successor to the Unix operating system, retained the ability to run most Unix code.
The Blit, later commercialized at the AT&T 5620, was an amphibian — it could act as a conventional smart terminal, or it could download software from its host machine that would give it many of the GUI capabilities of an Alto or D-machine.
Outside of Bell Labs and the special context of Plan 9 this amphibian was a solution that never found a problem, and the Unix community s first attempt at integrating a PARC-style interface sank into obscurity.
A few years later, however, Blit-like machines with local-area-network jacks and the character-terminal features discarded would rise again, as the X terminal.
The Xerox Star  1981 .
That same year, in 1981, Xerox finally brought a machine based on the PARC technology to market.
It was called the Xerox Star, and it was a failure.
Technically, it was woefully underpowered, slow, and overpriced.
Hesitant and inept marketing did not help matters.
Many of the developers, sensing more willingness from Apple and other emerging PC companies to push the technology, had started to bail out of PARC in 1980; the failure of the Star accelerated the process.
Xerox, despite having pioneered the GUI and several of the other key technologies of modern computing, never turned a profit from them.
Screen shot from a Star  1981 .
The Star interface pioneered the desktop metaphor that would be ubiquitous in later GUIs.
The third key event of 1981 was the first IBM personal computer.
This did not advance the state of the art in GUIs — in fact,  the original PC-1 had graphics capability available only as an extra-cost option, and no mouse.
Its slow 8088 microprocessor could not have supported a PARC-style GUI even if the will and the design skill had been there to produce one.
Even then, however, it was obvious that IBM s entry into the market would eventually change everything.
Earlier PCs from Altair, Apple and elsewhere had been even more underpowered and crude than the IBM PC.
14 ] The earliest, like the Altair, harked back to pre-1960 mainframes, requiring programs to be read from paper tape or toggled in on front-panel switches.
The next milestone in the evolution of the GUI was actually to come out of the Unix world.
That next milestone was the 1982 release of the first Sun Microsystems computer, yet another mating of Unix with an Alto-inspired hardware design.
This one, however, would prove immensely more successful than the Perq or Blit.
In fact it set the pattern for one of the most successful product categories in the history of the computer industry — what became known within a few years as the technical workstation.
Workstations were Unix machines with high-resolution bit-mapped displays and built-in Ethernet.
Early in the workstation era most were designed to use the Motorola 68000 and its successors; later on they tended to be built around various 32- and 64-bit processors at a time when PC hardware was still struggling to transition from 8 to 16.
Workstations were designed  like the Alto  to be deployed as single-user machines on a local area network, but  again like the Alto  they were too expensive for individuals to own and were never marketed that way; instead they tended to be deployed in flocks, and the only way to get the use of one was to be a knowledge worker at a corporation or in academia.
Three of their largest markets were software-development organizations, electronic design and CAD CAM shops, and financial-services firms.
The Sun workstations and their imitators added very little to the GUI design pattern set at PARC; slightly glossier screen widgets with pseudo-beveled edges were nearly the extent of the visible additions.
Their success came from layering the PARC look-and-feel over a software platform, Unix, that was already familiar to many engineers and development shops.
Within five years the combination of GUI and command-line interfaces supported by workstations effectively wiped out traditional minicomputers and their staid command-line-only interfaces.
It would be nearly a decade before Sun s machines were seriously challenged for their leading role in the computer industry.
All through that decade Suns remained very expensive machines.
1984 with a pixel-addressable black-and-white display running a custom Alto-like window system.
The 3B1 attracted a small but loyal fan base as a personal machine for Unix programmers, but it was in an awkward spot on the price performance curve; too expensive for the home market, not powerful enough to compete as a full-fledged workstation.
It lasted barely three years before being plowed under by steadily more powerful PC-class machines with monitors that could not match the 3B1 s screen resolution but could do color.
The 3B1 s demise took the concept of the personal workstation down with it; nothing similar was ever attempted afterwards, and the initiative in Alto-style interfaces once again passed out of the Unix world.
Thus, the really pivotal 1984 event in the history of the GUI was when Apple released the Macintosh and brought the Alto-style graphical user interface to the masses.
Perhaps it should have been the Amiga, designed in 1983 but released only after the Mac in 1985.
The Amiga followed the PARC GUI model, if perhaps less inventively than the Macintosh.

But Commodore mismanaged and squandered the opportunity after they acquired the Amiga development team.
Delayed and underfunded development, anemic marketing, over-expensive followon machines, bad strategic decisions and a bruising price war with Atari dogged the Amiga, but the technology was so attractive that it actually survived the IBM PC, the Macintosh, and the 1994 bankruptcy of Commodore.
For nearly a decade afterwards the Amiga retained a niche in video mixing and production.

This is as good as the resolution of color monitors got in 1985 — no better than 640x256, not good enough to render fonts with the clarity of the black-and-white displays on the Star or Macintosh.
Apple did not squander its opportunity.
Part of what made the first Macintosh a pivotal event was that Apple did not merely copy the PARC pattern; they reinvented and improved it.
The development took five years, an eon by industry standards, and involved deeper investigation of interface psychology and design than anyone had ever attempted before.
Apple successfully claimed the leading role in carrying forward the PARC-style GUI.
Two decades later, the Apple Human Interface Guidelines are still recommended reading for anyone who wants to do graphical user interfaces well.

Compare this with the Amiga screenshot from the same year to see the dramatic difference between the quality of black and white vs.
Technically, the Amiga and Macintosh shared one major limitation with a subtle but important impact on UI design: unlike the PARC designs or any Unix machine, they supported only cooperative rather than preemptive multitasking.
That is, they were not equipped to timeslice among any number of concurrent user and system processes; rather, a program had to give up control of the processor before any other program  even the system routines  could take over.
Cooperative multitasking was an economy measure.
It meant the hardware platform could omit an expensive MMU  memory-management unit  from its parts list.
On the other hand, it meant that the latency of interfaces was minimal and constant, never disturbed by random interrupts or scheduler-introduced jitter.
This made for a smooth, predictable user experience even on relatively underpowered hardware.
On the third hand, the absence of preemption turned into a serious liability as computers became more and more networked.
It was literally the case that an entire network of Apple machines could be frozen by a user holding down a shift key at the wrong time!
Despite this weakness, the Macintosh had an even larger impact on user-interface design than had the Alto, because it was not dismissable as a mere laboratory toy but rather a very successful consumer product.
GUIs, it proved, could sell computers to the mass market.
Microsoft and others in the personal-computer market scrambled to adapt.

Early versions were ugly and unsuccessful, garishly colorized but weak efforts to clone the PARC GUI that didn t support even such basic features as overlapping windows; they largely failed to displace Microsoft s own DOS product.
Microsoft s time was not yet.
