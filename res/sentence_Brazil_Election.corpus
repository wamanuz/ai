General elections were held in Brazil on 5 October 2014 to elect the President , the National Congress , state governors and state legislatures.
Incumbent President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers  Party  PT , Brazil s first female president, was challenged by 11 other candidates, of whom Minas Gerais , Senator Aécio Neves from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  and Marina Silva from the Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB  were her main rivals.

The election appeared to have been carried out peacefully as 143 million voters headed to polling stations everywhere from the Atlantic seaboard to deep inside the Amazon rainforest.
Until the previous day, most had been expecting a run-off against Silva, but, having toyed with change, the electorate eventually opted for the two main parties of left and right that have dominated Brazil politics for decades.

SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters  - A tight runoff campaign for Brazil s presidency kicked off on Monday with leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff and pro-business rival Aecio Neves racing to win over supporters of the third-placed candidate after she was knocked out of the election.
Rousseff remains a slight favorite as she has strong support among Brazil s poor but Neves is within striking distance and is expected to pick up most of the 21 percent of voters who backed the third-placed finisher, environmentalist Marina Silva.
Latin America s largest economy has been stuck in a rut for nearly four years under Rousseff, and most of Brazil s business community and Wall Street investors have made no secret of their desire for change.
Investors don t win elections in Brazil.
She had soared in opinion polls earlier in the race and looked on track to win the election in a runoff.
Her support crumbled in the homestretch amid questions about her shifting views on major issues, but she is admired by many voters and could still help swing the election with an endorsement.
The runoff will be a battle between opposing visions for Brazil: the state-led capitalism of the ruling Workers  Party, and the market-friendly policies promised by Neves and the PSDB.
The two parties are arch-rivals and between them they have run Brazil for the last 20 years.
Capitalists destroyed Brazil and neighboring countries, enriching the few while heaping misery on the masses.
TO DESCRIBE the final weeks of Brazil’s presidential campaign as dramatic would be putting it mildly.
This being Brazil, there was also scandal, as a former executive at Petrobras, the statecontrolled oil firm, alleged that politicians from Ms Rousseff’s left-wing Workers’ Party  PT  and some coalition allies were involved in a kickback scheme there.
And not just with any prior Brazilian election, but with anything that has happened anywhere in the world, at least in living memory, according to José Toledo of Estadão Dados, a data website.
The prediction that commands most confidence is that Ms Rousseff will not secure an outright majority in the first round and that the election will go to a run-off on October 26th.
A black environmentalist with a reputation for probity and the promise of breaking the PT-PSDB chokehold on power, she had already managed a solid third place in the presidential election of 2010, with 20m votes.
A debate on Brazil’s most-watched television network on October 2nd will offer a chance to shine for Ms Silva, whose on-screen performances have been more assured than the president’s.
The battle for Brazil is going down to the wire.
Wall Street woke up feeling a little sad this morning, for its favorite candidate in Brazil’s presidential election, Marina Silva, placed third.
Over the last two months, financial markets made it clear they wanted Silva to be the next president of Brazil.
A month ago, when Silva was unexpectedly rising in the polls, predicted to win, Brazil’s stock market soared, rising nearly 7 percent.
Investors goosed Brazil’s real, for a short time making it “ the world’s best performing major currency in the three weeks after Silva announced her candidacy on Aug.
Last week, the wolves of Wall Street exercised their “veto,” punishing both Brazil’s currency and stock market.
Born into a dirt-poor family of rubber tappers in an Amazonian backwater, Silva is of African descent and would have been the first person of color to lead Brazil.
But in this election, she distanced herself from her activist past and aligned with Brazil’s agricultural and financial industries.
Silva though did come broadly to represent “the right,” at least in economic terms, promising tight budgets, high interest rates  to keep the bond markets happy , and the prospect of aligning Brazil more closely with US trade.
In addition to Brazil’s upcoming run-off, important elections are coming up in Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia—and only in the latter is the left assured a victory.
But as the region’s economic center of gravity and an important member of the so-called BRIC countries, Brazil has been absolutely indispensable in countering Washington on trade, war and surveillance.
At the United Nations, for instance, in 2004, Brazil and Argentina took the unprecedented step of sharing the two-year seat reserved for temporary Latin American members of the Security Council  Brazil sat the first year, Argentina the second .
Argentina currently holds the seat and Brazil backed its efforts to slow down Washington’s rush to war in Syria  that is, the first time around, in the fall of 2013 .
If it were not for Brazil’s often quiet maneuvering over the last thirteen years, Washington would have had the upper hand on any number of issues that would have made the world a nastier, more unstable place— extending its extraordinary rendition and torture program, for instance, isolating Cuba and Venezuela, implementing a hemisphere-wide Patriot Act, or institutionalizing corporate power in “ Free Trade Area of the Americas .
It’s not Brazil’s role to tell it what to do, since that would violate our foreign policy.
Brazil doesn’t comment on the internal situation of any country,” she said ; “For Brazil, it is very important to always look at Venezuela from the point of view of its achievements, through all of this, in the area of education and health care.


Sao Paulo, Brazil  CNN  -- Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff won a hotly contested runoff election on Sunday.
The election was one of the tightest competitions in recent years.
Rousseff, 66, presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil.
His campaign slogan promised reforms to lower inflation and encourage more investment in the country:  The sure path for Brazil to really change.
I ve written about Brazil pre-Lula and post-Lula and spent the last five years covering all aspects of the country for Dow Jones, Wall Street Journal and Barron s.
Meanwhile, for an undetermined amount of time, and with a little help from my friends, I will be parachuting primarily into Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Will Brazil’s economy rally after the election like it did in India when Narendra Modi and his BJP party stormed into parliament like a herd of elephants?
And what impact will the ongoing FIFA World Cup have on the presidential election four months from now?
We are working right now with the chances of a Dilma re-election in the order of about 50%,” says Raphael Juan, fund manager at BBT Asset in São Paulo.
In Brazil, a president can only be elected if he or she receives 51% of the popular vote.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff will likely win, whether Brazil wins the World Cup or not.
PSDB ran Brazil for 8 years under ex-Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and then lost to Workers’ Party front man Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
If the election goes to Eduardo Campos and his sidekick VP Marina Silva, a former heavy weight within the Workers’ Party, the scenario will be “identical to that of Neves.
But, it will be important to see what type of power is given to the vice president here, because she could alter the scenario somewhat, particularly on agribusiness issues, which accounts for 25% of Brazil’s GDP.
Everyone speculates on what a Brazil victory in the World Cup means for Dilma.
In the short run, some companies will benefit from the legacy of FIFA, yet the bigger challenge facing Brazil is slow growth and persistently high inflation over 6%.
No one on the Street cares if Brazil wins the World Cup.
The good news is that despite around $12 billion spent on new stadiums and some transportation investments, Brazil did manage to increase its budget for health and education, a sign that Dilma has been listening to the protesters.
From this perspective, we believe that Brazil is home to some good-quality companies that have the potential to perform well over the long term.
In 1998, Cardoso was re-elected but Brazil lost the World Cup to France 3 to zip.
In 2006, Lula won again, and Brazil did not even make it to the finals.
And lastly, in 2010, Brazil failed to make it to the finals, but the Workers’ Party stayed in power with Lula’s hand picked successor, Dilma.
What can strongly impact Dilma in her re-election bid will be how the event plays out this month: the protests, the problems with infrastructure at the stadiums, public safety and other problems that will get blamed on her.
If there are a lot of problems up until the end of the Cup, even if Brazil ends up winning, the negativity and the discontent among the population will be reflected in the  poll  numbers,” says Juan.
But, if there are no problems between now and the end of the World Cup, even if Brazil is eliminated, there will be no impact at the polls,” Juan says.
In a country like Brazil polls invariably lie in order to try to manipulate the masses.

Brazil s presidential race will go to a second round after incumbent Dilma Rousseff fell short of an outright victory in Sunday s election.
The majority of Brazilians want us to speed up the Brazil we are building,  said Ms Rousseff, who heads the left-wing Workers  Party  PT .
President Dilma Rousseff has blamed Brazil s economic woes on the global financial crisis.
He says Brazil needs to be more attractive to business to encourage investment.
The past 12 years have seen Brazil s fortunes change but people aren t worried about the past, they re concerned about the future.
Although there are now two distinct visions for the future of Brazil - Aecio Neves s business-friendly image or the paternalistic interventionism of Dilma Rousseff - whoever persuades voters that they can provide a bit of both might well win the ultimate prize.
The election results have surprised many in Brazil, the BBC s Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro says.
Can a new government allay Brazil s economic woes?
Bill Adams, Senior International Economist at PNC Financial Services Group, explains why the new government can only address Brazil s recession  slowly and indirectly.
The Next Funds Ibovespa Linked ETF, an exchange-traded fund on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that tracks several heavyweight Brazilian stocks, dropped over 7 percent on Monday—an early indication of how bad the selloff in Brazil could be.
Investors hoped that a Neves victory would yield much-needed reforms on the welfare, fiscal and labor fronts, and see Brazil shift from consumption-led growth to investment-driven growth.
Capital Economics doesn t expect Rousseff to make any breakthroughs in tackling high inflation and Brazil s deteriorating fiscal position.
This could result in 2 percent annual growth, roughly half of what the group believes economies at Brazil s stage of development should be able to achieve.
Investor confidence is key to Brazil s economic recovery, and Rousseff s administration may alter administrative practices to improve investment appetite, according to Societe Generale.
Sacha Tihanyi, Senior Currency Strategist at Scotiabank, explains his bearish outlook for Brazil s financial markets after the re-election of President Dilma Rousseff.

Allegations of endemic political corruption dominated the end of campaigning    as Brazil voted in the closest presidential election in recent decades on    Sunday.
In the last TV debate before the election, Mr Neves said: “There is one easy    way to put an end to corruption: throw the Workers’ Party out of office.
Brazil s President Dilma Rousseff embraces with Brazil s former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as they celebrate the results of the elections in a hotel in Brasilia on Sunday.
Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,  said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil s leading think tank.
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps — those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
Aecio Neves, presidential candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, left,  gives his concession speech next to his wife Leticia Weber, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, on Sunday.
This year s campaign is widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.
We ve worked so hard to better the lives of the people, and we won t let anything in this world, not even in this crisis or all the pessimism, take away what they ve conquered,  Rousseff said before voting in southern Brazil.
In Brazil s biggest city of Sao Paulo, hundreds of Workers  Party supporters gathered on a main avenue, waving banners as a truck with giant speakers blasted Rousseff s campaign jingles.
I m very happy because I think the construction of Brazil has barely begun and now we will have continuity,  said Liliane Viana, a 56-year-old retired federal government worker.

In September, it appeared certain that incumbent president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, would struggle in a second round run-off vote with Marina Silva, a petite firebrand and one of the former stars of Dilma’s Workers’ Party.
While this election is likely to go to a second round run-off, and possibly pitting Marina vs Dilma in an ex-Workers’ Party vs Workers’ Party bid for the presidency, Dilma has some power in her corner now.
That power isn’t Workers’ Party strongman Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was and still is one of Brazil’s favorite politicians.
He has been relatively quiet this election season.
Simply put, after 12 years of Workers’ Party rule, Brazil is better.
Brazil incumbent Dilma Rousseff has good stats on her side, and better discourse on the economic front that could propel her to victory either Sunday or in a second election on Oct.
All Dilma has to do to win is remind Brazilians that Brazil is better.
When you think about it, this is exactly what the protests were about in Brazil over the last year.
On one had, public services in Brazil have a lot of room for improvement.
There were a few mistakes in the survey, which the media and rival parties pounced on to promote the story that IBGE was working to make Brazil look flawless in order to give Dilma a boost.
Still, the facts remain: Brazil is better now than it was 12 years ago.
Marina’s late summer  winter in Brazil  surge surprised everyone.
Barclays Capital economist Marcelo Salomon was even playing with the idea that Marina was going to be Brazil’s second female president.
Further strengthening of the dollar is creating a deflationary headwind for commodity sensitive emerging markets like Brazil.
The dollar’s recent strength is a negative for Brazil’s financial market, regardless of who wins.
She has already won over at least half of the country just for being the Workers’ Party candidate, a party that has helped Brazil improve over its 12 years in power.
That is a rarity in Brazil, but a second round challenger will have a harder time now than people perceived a month ago.
Wouldn’t necessarily disagree that Brazil – on paper, anyway – is somewhat better than it was 12 years ago, but I’m not sure it had much to do with the PT, Lula or Dilma – and that’s the real issue, for me.
It seems to me that Brazil stands on the edge of a precipice caused by serial uselessness, and the PT could well be the machine that drives it over the edge.
This will, regrettably, probably be the clincher – and we’ll be back again with the usual corruption, incompetence, bureaucracy, inefficiency and all the same dysfunctional systems so beloved of Brazil.
Dilma and the PT party have been the most corrupt and economically stifling governments in decades in Brazil.
Remember all the Brazilians in the middle classes that would shrink in their seats in front of an American or European whenever those cultures made the slightest comment about all the poverty in Brazil.
The North Northeast of Brazil was compared to AFRICA…and not too long ago either.
I mostly agree with your sentiment Douglas, although I think you’re being unfair to the author  but perhaps the statement “a party that has helped Brazil improve over its 12 years in power.
The election is more likely to be won by an uneducated majority, who couldn’t give a rat’s ass about any of this high-brow stuff.
It is not even remotely arguable that brazil became part of the world stage and the world conversation under Lula’s watch.
Make that Caipirinha a double today if you invest in Brazil.
Brazilian stocks plummeted Monday after President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won a re-election against Aecio Neves, a pro-business candidate that many in the investment community hoped could lift the country out of its economic malaise.
Brazil s Bovespa Stock Index   IBOV   fell by 4% while the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF   EWZ  , which tracks a broad range of the country s companies, dove over 6%.
Hopes for reform to address Brazil s structural economic problems have been dimmed, if not dashed.
The election results have broad implications for the Brazil s economy, which is South America s largest.
But the event became divisive as the government spent billions on brand new stadiums even as poverty continued to plague Brazil s favelas, or shanty towns.
In a report this month, the IMF said it now expects Brazil to eke out growth of just 0.
And in March, Standard and Poor s downgraded Brazil s long term sovereign bonds to just one notch above junk status.
The nail-bitingly close election in many ways showcased a country at a crossroads.
Rousseff, at one point a Marxist rebel who was allegedly tortured in the 1970s during Brazil s former dictatorship, ran on a social platform of helping the poor.
No candidate in Brazil s presidential election won an outright first round victory, so the top two contenders will face each other in a run-off on 26 October.
Environmentalist Marina Silva, who until recently had been leading in pre-election opinion polls, is out of the running after only getting 21% of the vote.
Why has the election been so unpredictable?
Until mid-August, the election appeared to be heading for a predictable outcome: most opinion polls indicated a clear lead for Ms Rousseff with Mr Neves coming second.
Others who liked her message of change were concerned her evangelical religion would stand in the way of changing Brazil s restrictive abortion legislation .
Ms Silva - an environmentalist - had also worried many within the green movement when she appeased Brazil s powerful agribusiness sector by expressing support for GM crops and agriculture  on all levels .
Mr Neves, 54, is a member of Brazil s white political elite, whose grandfather Tancredo Neves successfully ran for the presidency in 1985 but died before taking office.
Currently a senator, Mr Neves served as the governor of Brazil s second most populous state, Minas Gerais, from 2003 to 2010.
He is seen as the candidate who is favoured by big business in Brazil and has in the past condemned President Rousseff s handling of the economy, accusing the Workers  Party of frightening off investors.
SAO PAULO RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 6  Reuters  - An unexpectedly competitive runoff campaign for Brazil s presidency kicked off on Monday with leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff and her pro-business rival Aecio Neves racing to win over supporters of an ousted third-place candidate and other voters frustrated with a stagnant economy.
Brazil s most unpredictable election in decades.
Latin America s largest economy has been stuck in a rut for nearly four years under Rousseff, and most of Brazil s business community and Wall Street investors have made no secret of their desire for change.
Silva s campaign fell apart late in the race amid questions about her shifting views on major issues, but she remains admired by many voters and she could still help swing the election with an endorsement.
I don t think it would be good for Brazil to have four more years of  Rousseff ,  Giannetti said, according to the website for Veja magazine.
The runoff will be a battle between opposing visions for Brazil: the state-led capitalism of the ruling Workers  Party, and the market-friendly policies promised by Neves and the PSDB.
The two arch-rival parties have run Brazil for the last 20 years, and the campaign is already breaking down along class lines as Rousseff accuses the PSDB of favoring the rich.
More than half of Brazil s voters live in households earning less than $1,000 a month.
Rousseff said on Sunday that Brazilian voters  don t want a return to the past,  and called the PSDB the party of recession - even though Brazil s economy contracted under her own watch earlier this year.
President Dilma Rousseff has promised to re-unite Brazil after narrowly winning re-election to a second term in office with 51.
Whereas Dilma Rousseff did well in the poorer northern states, her opponent from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  took many of the wealthier and more developed southern parts of Brazil.
The election race was full of twists and turns - all closely followed by the financial markets.
Ms Rousseff needs to persuade the business community that she is serious about tackling Brazil s economic woes.
Or will she, as promised, focus on reforms, to win back investor and consumer confidence and get Brazil growing once again?
Her lead over the Brazilian Social Democracy Party dropped from 12 percentage points in 2010 to three in Sunday s election.
He said that the  overriding priority is to unite Brazil around an honourable programme worthy of all Brazilians .
Both Ms Rousseff and Mr Neves had made economic growth central to their election campaigns and the president again referred to her plans in her victory speech.
With Brazil s once booming economy now stagnant and inflation on the rise, analysts say her main challenges will be to regain the confidence of investors as well as that of those Brazilians who voted for Mr Neves.
Are you in Brazil?
What will the re-election of Dilma Rousseff mean for you?
Neves, the former governor of Minas Gerais state, has said he would name his top economic adviser, former central bank President Arminio Fraga, as his finance minister as part of efforts to regain investor confidence in Brazil.
The strong showing for Neves helped reverse September’s slump in Brazilian stocks and the currency, which had the worst month in at least two years on expectation of a Rousseff re-election.
In order to win the election, 54-year-old Neves would need to secure about two-thirds of the votes Silva got in the first round, according to Bruno Rovai, an emerging-market analyst at Barclays Plc.
While Rousseff’s party will remain the largest in the lower house of Congress, it will lose 18 seats to have 70 votes, based on partial election results, the Chamber of Deputies news agency reported yesterday.

Under Rousseff’s watch, Brazil slipped into its first recession in more than five years in the second quarter, even after she cut taxes on consumer goods and increased government spending.
A weak economic outlook will probably keep weighing on the country’s markets regardless of the winner of the election, according to Michelle Gibley, director of international research at San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp.
If you look at a longer-term basis, it’s going to be tough to change Brazil ’s course.
On Sunday, Brazil will hold a run-off election to decide between its final two presidential candidates, Dilma Rousseff and Aécio Neves.
What follows is a very, very brief guide to Brazil 2014 basics: who s running, the parties, and why it matters.
Despite the name, the PSDB is on Brazil s center-right, and held power before the WP s victory in the 2002 election.
As in most democratic countries, the economy is at the center of the election.
It s a left-right election, so Rousseff favors expanding government programs to address these problems, while Neves prefers a slate of market-friendly reforms.

The runoff in the presidential election in Brazil will take place this weekend between the incumbent President Dilma Roussef  PT  and challenger Aécio Neves  PSDB .
Even the endorsement of Neves by the third-place candidate on the general election, Marina Silva  PSB , did not change that.
Even the British weekly the Economist was quick to point to the difficulty of predicting the outcome of the general election in Brazil.
This, then, begs the question: How did Brazilian pollsters perform in the first stage of the election?
To answer that question, we deployed a statistical model that allows us to estimate the true vote intention throughout the general election, and use this information to calculate the systematic bias of each pollster.
This is similar to what Simon Jackman used in his analysis of “house effects” for the 2004 Australian federal election, or what Drew Linzer used to forecast the Electoral College votes in the 2012 U.
In our case, we used all polls published in Brazil starting in early February of this year and ending with the last published surveys before the election.
Our task is facilitated by the fact that we know the actual result of the general election.
But we can say that the tragic death of PSB candidate Eduardo Campos and the entry of Marina Silva to substitute for him was a game changer in the election for a brief period.
Now we can answer the initial question: How did Brazilian pollsters do in the general election campaign?
Perhaps most interesting is that most polling firms seem to have consistently underestimated Aécio Neves, who ended in second place on the general election.
Now that we know that no candidate got the necessary majority to win the election outright, we will have two very different moments that will be interesting to contrast: the general election, which was strictly multipartisan, and the runoff, which will be strictly bipartisan.

But just days before Brazil ’s presidential runoff, the battleground for antigovernment protests in Lapa is a sea of red, the color of Brazil’s ruling Workers’ Party.
Galiña – like many others active in Brazil’s protests – is doing something that few could have imagined just a few months ago: enthusiastically supporting the reelection of incumbent Dilma Rousseff .
But support for Rousseff in Sunday s hyper-polarized runoff election could bring about renewed disenchantment, says Luiz Jorge Werneck Vianna, a sociologist at Rio de Janeiro’s Pontifical Catholic University.
How is it that Dilma will govern after the election?
In the first round of voting in early October, Brazil’s far left vehemently rejected former environmental minister  and socialist party candidate Marina Silva, who took over the ticket after her running mate was killed in a plane crash.
Neves is deeply pronounced: Neves polls higher among wealthy and college educated Brazilians, while Rousseff has a lead in Brazil’s poorest states, where large portions of the population participate in welfare programs like Bolsa Família , which gives cash directly to mothers in exchange for keeping their kids in school and up to date on medical visits.
Endorsements for Rousseff among influential figures in Brazil’s far left include a well-known founder of the citizen media collective, Ninja Media; an actor from a popular YouTube comedy troop that makes snarky political satires; and the Rio activist and independent media group Colectivo Vinhetando.
Despite the election being painted as a high-stakes battle between left and right, the  candidates’ platforms are , in many ways, rather similar.
In June 2013, when antigovernment protests rocked Brazil – spurred by anger over a rise in the price of bus fares – the movement  brought together Brazilians of diverse  and even clashing political stripes, united in their exasperation with the status quo.
One year later, as Brazil prepared to host the 2014 World Cup, protesters were notably more homogeneous, made up of far-left activists who often faced off with police.
Many in among the far left that demonstrated until the very end now express robust support for Rousseff on social media, with hashtags like #AécioNever and #CoraçãoValente  “brave heart,” a nod to her time as a political prisoner and torture victim during Brazil’s 1964-85 military dictatorship.
News and comment from more than 40 emerging economies, headed by Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Brazil s ongoing presidential election has been described as electrifying and unpredictable, suitable for a telenovela.
According to the Neves camp, Rousseff would continue the state-interventionist, protectionist policies she pursued during her first term, which have led to inflation and an economic slowdown, while Neves would embrace more market-friendly approaches and would open Brazil to the world, including the United States.
Rousseff, in turn, accuses Neves of proposing an economic program that serves the bankers and industrialists, while planning to cut back popular welfare programs that have made Brazil more equal and middle-class.
Poor Brazilians -- most receive cash payments and are concentrated in the north of Brazil -- overwhelmingly favor Rousseff, while those from the upper strata, particularly in the southern region around São Paulo, Brazil s major city, are keen on Neves.
Silva and her adopted Socialist Party have backed Neves in the second round, though it is not clear whether that will be enough to deny Rousseff re-election.
The election may be mercurial, but that doesn t mean Brazilians have been indecisive.
The election puts into sharp relief two competing narratives that have recently dominated Brazil coverage in both Brazilian and international media.
To be sure, corruption has been endemic in Brazil, but two major scandals during the PT government inflicted more political damage on the party that has been in power since 2003.
Since Rousseff served as energy minister under Lula, the recent and mounting charges of bribery and kickbacks at Petrobras, Brazil s state-owned company, could particularly hurt her.
In the case of Brazil, though unemployment remains low, inflation and interest rates are climbing, and the economy is stagnant -- the result not only of a more problematic external environment but also of some questionable policy decisions.
There has been a tendency to overstate the differences, particularly by Neves supporters in Brazil and abroad, who are eager for a greater opening of the economy and a more robust trade policy, along with friendlier relations between Brasilia and Washington.
There is little question that much of Washington, frustrated with Rousseff, would likely be more enthusiastic and energetic in pursuing new initiatives with Brazil under a Neves government.
It is useful to remember that the global stature Brazil has achieved in recent years -- inclusion as a BRIC member, along with Russia, India, and China, major roles in WTO negotiations and environmental conferences, a credible bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council -- is to some extent attributable to its independence and distance from the United States.
The prospect of a  strategic partnership  between the United States and Brazil is far-fetched, at least in the short term.
An election dominated by negative campaigning should not obscure the broad consensus among Brazilians about the path their country should pursue.
The challenge is finding the leader and team best equipped to navigate Brazil s political and bureaucratic thicket.

Rousseff, Brazil s first woman president, was the narrow favorite heading into the vote, with a four- to six-point advantage in the final opinion polls -- though the race to lead the world s seventh-largest economy remained too close to call.
The election is widely seen as a referendum on 12 years of government by the Workers  Party  PT  -- eight under working-class hero Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and four under Rousseff.
But the outlook has darkened since Rousseff won election in 2010, the year economic growth peaked at 7.
We are voting for a more equal Brazil with more opportunities,  Rousseff said after casting her vote in the southern city of Porto Alegre, sipping on a cup of local mate tea.
Ours is to ensure Brazil continues to grow with more health and education.
First she had to fend off environmentalist Marina Silva, who surged in the opinion polls with her vow to become Brazil s first  poor, black  president when she dramatically entered the race after running mate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash.
Neves, the grandson of the man elected Brazil s first post-dictatorship president, responded in kind, accusing Rousseff of lying, incompetent economic management and  collusion  in the Petrobras kickbacks.
Nationwide 147 people were arrested for election-related  irregularities  -- mostly illegal campaigning, election officials said.

RIO DE JANEIRO  AP  — It s the presidential election that just keeps surprising.
A year after a spasm of huge anti-government protests across Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff piled up more votes in Sunday s election than any challenger, but it wasn t enough to avoid a runoff in three weeks.
Brazil s two most powerful parties, which together have produced all of Brazil s presidents the past 20 years and are well known to Brazilians.
Neves is backed by the well-organized Social Democracy Party, which held the presidency from 1994 until 2002, a period when Brazil tamed hyperinflation and turned the economy around.
Aecio s performance has been extraordinary, and one of the reasons for this is the very strong party structure behind him — a party with a strong nationwide presence and which has been in the presidency,  said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil s leading think tank.
It is now a new election where everything is wide open.
Neves is an economist and former two-term governor of Minas Gerais, Brazil s second-most populous state, where he left office in 2010 with an approval rating above 90%.
He has strong name recognition in Brazil as the grandson of Tancredo Neves, a widely beloved figure who was chosen to become Brazil s first post-dictatorship president but fell ill and died before taking office.
She s only responding to attacks,  said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.
I feel strongly I received a message, a simple message saying I must continue moving forward … to change Brazil,  Rousseff told a crowd of supporters late Sunday.
Challenger Marina Silva  left  and incumbent Dilma Rousseff face off during a presidential debate in Aparecida, Brazil, in September.
But first she must beat incumbent Dilma Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured under the dictatorship in Brazil.
It s been an election season filled with shocks.
And suddenly what looked like an easy re-election for Rousseff got very competitive and very negative.
It alleges Silva s plan to make Brazil s central bank independent will hand over its power to big business.
None of the candidates seem to have the required 50 percent to win outright, and so the election will — it seems — go to a second round.
Everyone is required by law to vote in Brazil and debates can get rather heated, as we discovered when we visited the humble, tin-roofed house of the dos Santos family.
But under Rousseff s party Brazil boomed.
And that s why this election is too close to call.
Now, it s a proper neighborhood with a community center and paved roads, its history a reflection of the dramatic changes in Brazil in the last decade.
Dilma Rousseff is ending her term with Brazil in much worse shape than when she received it,  says David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the University of Brasilia.
RIO DE JANEIRO  AP  — Brazil s left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race the nation has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, after a bitter campaign that divided Brazilians like no other before it.
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps — those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
The Workers  Party s time in power has seen a profound transformation in Brazil.
This year s campaign is widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and challengers Marina Silva and Aecio Neves have sparred over currency policy and social programs in the run-up to the presidential election Sunday.
However, business leaders have contended Brazil’s unwillingness to nurture its relationships with foreign partners has contributed to a stagnant economy that shrank for two consecutive quarters amid rising inflation and a weakening currency.
Meanwhile, Brazil’s relationship with the U.
If Rousseff retains her presidency, Brazil will likely continue its narrow foreign policy focused on strengthening relationships within South America.
Rousseff’s rivals, Silva and Neves, are currently neck and neck in polls to move into a runoff election with the incumbent.
Both would rethink Brazil’s role in Mercosur.
Silva is also critical of Brazil’s relationship with Russia, India, China and South Africa through the BRICS economic partnership.
She would rather see Brazil work with the Pacific Alliance, which consists of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
Meanwhile, Neves wants to focus less on Brazil’s often-controversial relationships with leftist governments in countries such as Venezuela and more on strengthening relationships with the U.
Under Rousseff, Brazil largely maintains a noninterventionist foreign policy.

Sao Paulo, Brazil  CNN  -- Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff won a hotly contested runoff election on Sunday.
The election was one of the tightest competitions in recent years.
Rousseff, 66, presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil.
His campaign slogan promised reforms to lower inflation and encourage more investment in the country:  The sure path for Brazil to really change.
Cardoso, who modernized Latin America’s biggest economy during his two terms from 1995 to 2003 and remains one of Brazil’s most respected politicians, told me in an interview that if opposition candidate Marina Silva wins, she would not give her unconditional support to Venezuela, Argentina and other leftist populist governments, as current President Dilma Rousseff has done.
The opposition’s victory would mean a kind of rupture in Brazil’s foreign policy, especially in regards to South America.
Under Rousseff, he said, “there is a paralysis in Brazil’s foreign policy” because she has been focused on trying to revitalize South America’s ailing Mercosur common market instead of trying to simultaneously sign free-trade agreements with the European Union, the United States and Japan.
But not in their heads, because they know that Brazil’s interests don’t coincide with that ideology.
If Silva wins, Cardoso said, she would try to shift away from Brazil’s current, inward-looking, Mercosur-centered policies.
In addition, Brazil would be more assertive in defending democracy in the region, Cardoso said.
Much of this would change if the opposition wins in Brazil,” Cardoso said.
Asked why he is so confident that the opposition will win, considering that the some surveys are showing a statistical tie in the runoff election, Cardoso cited the fact that Rousseff’s Workers Party is leading in the polls in only three of Brazil’s 27 states, and that Rousseff has a much higher negative rating than Silva.
If that happens, there will be a major push to get Brazil out of its current economic and foreign policy paralysis, which is resulting in a paltry 0.
As Cardoso says, an opposition win would mean fewer ideological attachments to “Third World-ish” governments, and a new focus on inserting Brazil into the global economy by signing trade deals with the biggest industrialized countries.
That could help Brazil return to a growth path, and — considering that the country makes up more than 60 percent of South America’s economy — could turn the whole region in a new economic and political direction.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil – Brazil’s electorate is split a week ahead of presidential elections, with polls showing leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff locked in a dead heat with main rival Marina Silva, who preaches the need for a “new politics.

Rousseff’s government had already been enduring a bumpy ride after protests drew around a million people onto the streets in June 2013 to protest poor public services while Brazil was investing in the World Cup.
The protest movement accused the political elite of being inefficient, corrupt and unable to deliver health, education and transport systems worthy of the developed country Brazil aspires to be.
Or they can twist with Silva, who rose from a humble background in a village in Amazonia, the daughter of rubber tappers who only learned to read at 16 and worked as a maid before rising to become Brazil’s youngest senator and then environment minister.
The religious convictions of a woman who could become Brazil’s first black leader wow some in a country where evangelicals are on the rise — but equally turn others off.
Investors also prefer her to Rousseff’s financial interventionism, which they blame for Brazil’s economic ills.
Millions cast their ballot for next president, as polls show incumbent Dilma Rousseff defeating election rivals.
Millions of Brazilians are heading to the polls to choose the country s next president, in one of the most unpredictable election campaigns in decades.
On the eve of the election, Rousseff held a commanding lead in all recent opinion polls, followed by Aecio Neves and Marina Silva, a former environment minister.
Roussef told reporters early on Sunday it was unlikely she could push through to win the absolute majority required to avoid a second-round election.
The election, expected to be the closest in a generation, is widely seen as a referendum on 12 years of government by Rousseff s Workers  Party  PT .
Silva, who belongs to Brazil s surging Evangelical Christian community and says she wants to be the diverse country s first  poor, black president,  was initially projected to beat Rousseff in a runoff, but has now slipped back into the spot Campos occupied before his death.
BRASILIA  Reuters  - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff until recently appeared to be cruising towards re-election in October but she now finds herself in a tight race as an already sluggish economy takes a turn for the worse.
Frustration in Brazil s biggest cities is also mounting.
Poor public services and traffic gridlock, both factors that helped lead to mass demonstrations across Brazil last year, make daily life for many an increasingly unbearable slog.
A separate poll released Saturday by the Sensus polling institute also shows the election headed to a runoff, with Rousseff and Neves tied in a second round.
If Neves can pull off an upset, investors expect a return to the business-friendly policies that paved the way for the economic boom that Brazil enjoyed last decade.
He has pledged to restore Brazil s fiscal credibility by reining in public spending without sacrificing the social welfare programs that are so popular with Rousseff s base.
The anger from those protests did not spill over into Brazil s hosting of the recent World Cup football tournament, an event that was widely praised in sporting terms and which did little to harm Rousseff because it unfolded with few of the logistical nightmares that many expected.
Still, the tournament was perceived to go smoothly largely because Brazil declared holidays in host cities around most games, ensuring less of the chaos that regularly cripples Brazil s streets, trains and airports.
Life in Brazil s cities is deteriorating fast and there is a very strong public sentiment that the government is not doing what it should be doing to improve electricity, water, sewage and transport services,  said Jose Augusto Guilhon Albuquerque, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo.
She also enjoys the backing of her mentor and predecessor as president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a legendary campaigner and still Brazil s most popular politician.
Worried about Rousseff s slide in the polls, Lula has called on her campaign to aggressively tout the reduction in poverty and other social gains that Brazil has seen under the Workers  Party.
During Lula s two terms, the Workers  Party received considerable campaign contributions from some of Brazil s largest businesses, happy with a booming economy and an expanding consumer market.
But Brazil s business class dislikes Rousseff for what they consider her heavy-handed intervention in the economy.
Her policies, they argue, have cut profit margins, discouraged investment and made Brazil less competitive.
The election now looks so close that experts in Brazilian politics are holding off predicting an outcome.
The face of power in Brazil is becoming ever more diverse.
The top two candidates in Brazil’s presidential race on Sunday are both leftists and women, one of whom is black.
The private sector’s preferred candidate, a white man from Brazil’s once-dominant center-right party, trails in the polls.
As part of a transnational research project called Enduring Reform, my colleagues and I interviewed business leaders in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico about progressive reforms in their cities.
This contrasts with attitudes in Brazil, where the business community still acts to oppose or limit progressive reform in its cities, according to our study.
Such attitudes fly in the face of Brazil’s changing times.
Through this democratic participation, Brazil is seeking to foster inclusion, lessen the income gap, and promote environmental sustainability.
If they use their economic clout and disproportionate political voice to limit it, they will remain politically marginalized and scrambling to have a say, as they look to be in the presidential election.

More than a decade of Workers Party  rule has seen Brazil prioritize ties with its leftist regional neighbors.
Under Rousseff and her two-term predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil has given strong backing to leftist regional allies, such as Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia.
Marina Silva, Brazilian Socialist Party presidential candidate, campaigns in the Rocinha slum of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Since then, her anti-establishment profile has propelled her to a neck-and-neck race with Brazil President Dilma Rousseff, who is seeking re-election.
Under Rousseff and her two-term predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil has given strong backing to leftist regional allies, such as Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia.
Most of her proposed changes would aim to lower tariffs, expand trade and revive Brazil s sputtering economy, which fell into recession this year after years of only feeble expansion.
Rousseff said earlier this month that Brazil turning its back on Mercosur would be  shooting ourselves in the foot,  emphasizing that  we have to realize the size of that market.
While Silva agrees a strong South America is still essential, her plan makes clear she would seek to pivot Brazil toward stronger ties with the broader global market and not be hobbled by its neighbors.
If Silva is elected,  Brazil, as a hemispheric power, will continue to maintain good relations with all the countries in the hemisphere,  said Riordan Roett, director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
Many expect Silva, a renowned environmentalist and human rights champion in the Amazon, to change Brazil s policies of largely ignoring alleged abuses in allies like Venezuela and Cuba.
Paulo newspaper, wrote that Brazil under the Workers Party has been the most powerful defender of Venezuela s former leader Hugo Chavez and current President Nicolas Maduro, backing both amid crises as they pushed ahead with their Bolivarian movement.

Brazilian society hasn’t been this divided since 1989,” the year of the first democratic election after the dictatorship, said Maria do Socorro Braga, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Sao Paulo.
Re-election is a vote of hope – especially that we will govern better – that’s what I heard from the ballot box.
On her watch, Brazil’s once vibrant economy has stalled and lately slipped into recession, while inflation has crept steadily up.
Her great challenge will be to fix problems with management of the economy and corruption, her two points of weakness in this election,” he added.
Neves’ Brazilian Social Democratic Party had the solid support of Brazil’s private sector and its upper middle class.
She had never fought an election until she won power in 2010.
Over the past two years Brazil has been hit by recession and protests over the poor state of the country’s infrastructure and the expense involved in hosting the World Cup.
An acrimonious and volatile presidential race has entered its final stretch in Brazil, with left-wing incumbent Dilma Rousseff and conservative challenger Aecio Neves running neck and neck ahead of a run-off.
Rousseff appears to have regained the momentum just days ahead of the October 26 election, after opinion polls showed she had slipped behind Neves last week.
This election has been marked by unusual political vulnerability ,” said Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
It’s been the most unpredictable election since the return of democratic elections in 1989 and will remain unpredictable until the end.
Uncertainty over the outcome has been heightened after pollsters’ stark failure to predict the results of the first round of the election on October 5.
But then it watched from the sidelines as Brazil enjoyed an economic fiesta under PT president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s two terms in office.
Between 2003, when Lula da Silva took office, and 2010, Brazil’s GDP grew by more than $1.
The PSDB lost a third-straight election in 2010, powerless against massively popular Lula da Silva’s hand-picked candidate, Rousseff .
Sotero agreed that Sunday’s election was easily the PSDB’s best shot at reclaiming the presidency since Lula da Silva pushed them out of the Planalto Palace in Brasilia 12 years ago.
Unemployment remains at historic lows, but the International Monetary Fund recently projected Brazil’s economy would grow by just 1.
Sotero points out that Lula da Silva, who survived throat cancer last year, will be turning 73 when the next presidential election rolls around, and that within the PT there seems to be no obvious successor to lead the party he founded.
Who to lead Brazil?
Brazil s left-wing president Dilma Rousseff wins re-election with 51.
Rousseff s election marks a continuation of her Worker s Party in control of Brazil s executive branch, which it has held since 2003.
In São Paulo, the capital of Brazil s wealthiest state, where Neves s Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  enjoys a large following, the mood was subdued.
Rousseff became the country s first woman president after her election in 2010.
Support: Rousseff became the country s first woman president after her election in 2010.
Rousseff s party often stoked fears among voters that if the PSDB returned to power, so too would the rampant inequality that defined Brazil pre-Lula.
Brazil s investor class has been cold on Rousseff, and Brazil s markets took a tumble on poll results showing she was likely to win the runoff.
Last month, federal police heard key testimony in a corruption scandal that broke earlier this year and has since soiled the name of Brazil s biggest company, spread to the highest offices in Brasilia and driven the news cycle ahead of this Sunday s presidential elections.
Costa went on to describe how Brazil s signature multinational had basically been converted into a giant ATM, tapping clients to fund political campaigns, including allegedly Rousseff s.

The oil giant known as Petrobras has seen its American depositary shares  ADSs  in New York get pounded Monday morning on news that Dilma Rousseff won the reelection in Brazil.
We have pondered of late just how much the shares of Petrobras were treated as a parabolic barometer of how the election polls were looking.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is entering a runoff against challenger Aecio Neves in this year s presidential election.
On Sunday voters in Brazil head to the polls for a second time to decide if the country will continue the populist policies of President Dilma Rousseff or turn right towards a more austere government.
You’re fairly evenly split between voters that believe that Brazil has gone to the wrong direction and a changed government is necessary, and another that firmly believes that the government in place is still the best option,” says Oliver Stuenkel, an assistant professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Brazil.
She typically finds support in Brazil’s poorest states, while Neves - who promises to reduce spending and decrease the size of the government - finds his backers among wealthier voters.
She entered the election late after her party’s presidential candidate was killed in a plane crash in August.
Voting is mandatory in Brazil, although those who don t wish to cast a ballot for either candidate may leave it blank.
Long-term foreign investors are growing more optimistic about Brazil no matter who wins this month s presidential election but they say an opposition victory could unleash a flood of new money.
The tight and fast-changing election campaign has sent Brazil s financial markets on a wild ride with big gains whenever leftist President Dilma Rousseff loses ground in polls and slides whenever her re-election bid seems stronger.
Rousseff s economic policies have been roundly criticized by investors for tipping Brazil into a recession while damaging state-run companies such as oil producer Petrobras and lender Banco do Brasil along the way.
Beyond the swings of a neck-and-neck race, however, long-term sentiment on Brazil has improved.
After we get the final results, then we would definitely look to increase Brazil in our portfolio,  said Ben Rozin, who helps manage more than $53 billion at Rochester, New York-based Manning & Napier, Inc.
Since August, when the death of presidential candidate Eduardo Campos in a plane crash upended the election race, investing in Brazil s stock market has been akin to riding a bucking bull, with sharp drops and jumps dictated by voter opinion polls.
The odds of a more open-minded Rousseff administration, they argue, increased after the strong showing of opposition parties in the election s first round.
Even those who are unconvinced that the president would change tack in a second term say Brazil will continue to offer interesting growth opportunities regardless.

The country is divided in two, with half feeling that social inclusion and protections are what matter most, and the other half believing that macroeconomic stability is more important,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think-tank .
The candidate who convinces voters he or she is best prepared to combine these two beliefs and make them complementary will win Sunday’s election.
The latest results from Brazil’s two most respected polling groups put Rousseff ahead of Neves.
But Patricia Botelha, who lives on a leafy street in Rio’s wealthy Ipanema neighbourhood, said Rousseff’s poor management had led Brazil’s economy to weak growth and all Brazilians will pay the price if the country doesn’t rebound soon.
While Brazil has many political parties, two parties in particular have come to dominate the Brazilian political stage – one leaning left while the other leans to the right.
This bipolar arrangement makes consensus difficult within Brazil’s governing institutions.
In this election, a center-left party, the Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB , was ahead by 9% in recent polls.
Luis Inácio Lula da Silva— known as ‘Lula’—provided Brazil with a burst of programs to improve social and economic equality as well as raise living standards.
Now, while some progressive voters say they will not vote for Dilma in Brazil’s upcoming October elections, many also say they would never vote for the right-wing opposition candidate either.
Unlike the United States, in Brazil voting is compulsory.
Unfortunately, however, PSB representative and former governor of Pernambuco  North East Brazil  Eduardo Campos, died in a plane crash on August 12.
What exactly does this mean for Brazil?
Although Campos offered strong hopes of bringing balance to Brazil’s electoral process, the nation has not appeared ready to break the cycle of bipolar parties.
During a recent forum at the Wilson Center, Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute, responded to Data Folha’s statement about the influence of the World Cup over the elections.
The fact that another party outside of PT and PSDB dominance might have the potential to be in the run-off of a presidential election would be historic.
Now, the hopes are on Marina Silva to push forward for a broader political participation in Brazil where other parties can equally have representatives running for presidency.

Voters are heading to the polls Sunday for Brazil s general elections, with the presidency, congressional seats and regional posts up for grabs.
State legislative seats are also on ballots across Brazil.
President Dilma Rousseff, according to the polls released on Saturday, will win the election with 40 percent of the vote, while Social Democrat Aecio Neves and environmentalist Marina Silva, who are both receiving the support of about 24 percent of voters, will fight for second place.
A run-off election will be held on Oct.
Rousseff will await the election results in Brasilia, while Neves will do so in Belo Horizonte and Silva will be in Sao Paulo as the results are released.
The results of exit polls will be available once all election precincts close, and the national elections commission plans to begin releasing preliminary official results soon after polling places close.
With the first round now over, Brazil s presidential elections evoked intense emotions that even a Greek Tragedy could not conjure up.
A runoff election in what was described as a very tightly competitive campaign will mean that Rousseff, who won 42 percent of the vote, will compete with Neves.
If this sounds too much like inside baseball, it probably is, except that as we approach election season in this country there are lessons we can learn from our Brazilian neighbors.
When the votes were counted Sunday night, the biggest losers were Brazil s pollsters and the many Washington pundits who were betting on a slam-down second round between Rousseff and Silva.
Chalk it up to Brazil s young democracy.
The pundits were so convinced of this that there were endless commentaries about her rise and what it would mean in Brazil.
Even The Economist website devoted its take on the election to this fatal flaw right after the results of the first round.
Silva s voters were limited to those in Brazil s northeast, her base for the Green Party, and in Acre, her native state.
Rising from extreme poverty, the daughter of rubber tappers in the Amazonian state of Acre, she became a leading voice of Brazil s environmental movement, eventually joining the Labor government of former President Lula da Silva  no relation  as minister of the environment.
But Silva s story is far from over as she may hold the key to the future of the presidency in Brazil.
A poll conducted the day before the election showed that 71 percent of her supporters would vote for Neves in a runoff.
Now Brazil s next president hangs in the balance as voters wait to see whom she will endorse.
The bigger question that you may be asking as your eyes glaze over these details is: Why should this election matter to the United States?
Just as the United States is a leader for the countries of the Global North, so Brazil has assumed leadership in the Global South.
Neves, the grandson of Brazil s first democratically elected president after the military dictatorship ended in 1985, would be more open to working with U.
If anything, Brazil and its neighbors have united together in their own subregional arrangements precisely to create a countervailing force to a region once dominated by the United States.
Of all the countries in South America, Brazil, as the largest and richest, is also poised to lead in the decades to come.
As part of the so-called BRICS  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa , Brazil is finding its voice as a leader of the Global South, a position that dominates its own foreign policy.
While foreign policy issues are not a feature of this presidential election in Brazil, it seems certain that no matter who wins this race in round two, the winner will want to ensure that the long-term relationship with the United States evolves in a way that benefits respective interests.
Economic questions could end up deciding the Brazilian election.
But the mutual mudslinging won t decide the election, says political scientist Susanne Gratius of the think tank FRIDE.
That could be an advantage for Neves, because Brazil s economy has stuttered during Rousseff s tenure.
But the economy is also an exciting election issue because it is one of the few areas where candidates can really set themselves apart.
Since 2010, Brazil s new debts have risen from 1.
But Neves  riposte to that is a drastic simplification of the taxation of goods, which is very complicated in Brazil.
So complicated, that it is often named alongside corruption, poor infrastructure, and export tolls as a reason why foreign companies don t invest in Brazil.
That might also be because Brazil s international standing is not as important to the incumbent president as it is to Neves; Though in February Rousseff went to Brussels to meet EU Commissioners to talk about a free trade agreement, she will only sign it once she s made a deal with Brazil s Mercosur partners  Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela .
He sees Brazil joining the international economy at the side of the US and the EU.
That s also how the actions of Moody s ratings agency could be read too: they released their prognosis for Brazil s credit rating four weeks before the first round of voting.
Three days later Moody s confirmed the implicit message with a declaration: Brazil s credit-worthiness does not depend on the result of the presidential election - the vital thing is how successful the next government will be in fighting the economic downward trend.
That s why I want to be a much better president than I have been until now,  she said after the election results were announced.
Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,  said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil s leading think tank.
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps - those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
This year s campaign was widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.
We ve worked so hard to better the lives of the people, and we won t let anything in this world, not even in this crisis or all the pessimism, take away what they ve conquered,  Rousseff said before voting in southern Brazil.
In Brazil s biggest city of Sao Paulo, thousands of Workers  Party supporters gathered on a main avenue, waving banners as a truck with giant speakers blasted Rousseff s campaign jingles.
I m very happy because I think the construction of Brazil has barely begun and now we will have continuity,  said Liliane Viana, a retired federal government worker.
If you look at the economic and military crisis going on all over the world in the last 8 years, Brazil has done fantastic during everybody else s downturns.
The election outcome shows the conservatives won.
While this is an exaggeration , a number of important dates related to the October elections will mark 2014 in Brazil.

The party has held the presidency in Brazil since 2003.
I’m very happy because I think the construction of Brazil has barely begun and now we will have continuity,” said Liliane Viana, a 56-year-old retired federal government worker.
Like president Dilma Rousseff, a former guerrilla who smuggled weapons and was brutally tortured during Brazil’s military dictatorship, Silva has an inspiring back story of overcoming adversity and becoming a leading activist before entering electoral politics.
She was born to a family of rubber-tappers in Acre, one of Brazil’s poorest states, in the Amazon.
A former guerrilla jailed and tortured for fighting the country’s 1964-1985 military regime, Rousseff — Brazil’s first woman president — has needed all her battling qualities to claw back the advantage on Neves.
But after Brazil benefited from an economic boom during the Lula years, the outlook has darkened since Rousseff won the 2010 election, the year economic growth peaked at 7.
Before the October 5 first-round vote, Rousseff fended off environmentalist Marina Silva, who initially surged in opinion polls with her vow to become Brazil’s first “poor, black” president having dramatically entered the race after running mate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash.
Neves, a 54-year-old senator and the grandson of the man elected Brazil’s first post-dictatorship president, responded in kind, accusing Rousseff of lying, incompetent economic management and “collusion” in the Petrobras kickbacks.
While the poor back the PT, Brazil’s elite are exasperated with interventionist economic policies such as gasoline price controls and high taxes.
Voting is compulsory in Brazil, Latin America’s largest democracy.
President Obama congratulates President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil on her re-election yesterday.
SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters  - Brazil s leftist President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won re-election on Sunday after convincing voters that her party s strong record of reducing poverty over the last 12 years was more important than a recent economic slump.
After one of the closest, most divisive campaigns in Brazil in decades, Rousseff won 51.
Voting was peaceful and Brazil s robust democracy is free of the political violence that mars some other countries in Latin America.
The result means another four years in power for the Workers  Party, which since 2003 has virtually transformed Brazil - lifting 40 million from poverty, reducing unemployment to record lows and making big inroads against hunger in what remains one of the world s most unequal countries.
The economy has slowed dramatically under Rousseff s heavy-handed and often unpredictable policies, making Brazil s glory days of robust growth last decade an ever-more distant memory.
Yet Rousseff and her supporters spent the campaign warning voters, especially the poor, that a vote for the PSDB would mean a return to the less compassionate, more unequal Brazil of the 1990s - an argument that Neves rigorously denied, but ultimately prevailed anyway.
Investors have generally disliked Rousseff s interventionist management of state-run companies and other sectors of the economy, and Brazil s financial markets plummeted last week when polls showed she was likely to win a second term.
With 200 million people and a gross domestic product of some $2 trillion, Brazil is Latin America s largest economy and its most populous country.
The election was one of the most dramatic since full democracy returned to Brazil in 1989.
The daughter of a Bulgarian aristocrat who emigrated to Brazil during World War Two, she was a relatively obscure government technocrat until her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hand-picked her as his successor.
Many in the Workers  Party are already thinking ahead to the next election in 2018, when Lula, who governed from 2003 to 2010, has said he may run again.
Neves  PSDB, meanwhile, faces an uncertain future after falling short in three straight presidential contests due in part to its image as the party of Brazil s wealthy minority.
Assembly: Brazil has a bicameral National Congress  Congresso Nacional  consisting of the Federal Senate  Senado Federal  with 81 seats and the Chamber of Deputies  Camara dos Deputados  with 513 seats.
SÃO PAULO, Brazil — President Dilma Rousseff won a second term on Sunday, defeating the conservative Aécio Neves in an acrimonious race that inflamed social and economic divisions in an emerging giant humbled by falling commodity prices.
But Brazil’s first female president won four more years by nurturing deep support among Brazil’s poor, who have benefited under a major expansion of the welfare system, and with a late surge in female voters.
Rousseff sought a conciliatory tone, promising dialogue with the opposition after a contentious election.
The heat of the debate can be turned into energy for a new moment in Brazil.
Rousseff’s re-election will likely prolong a period of stagnant relations with Latin America’s biggest economy, a prominent player in a region where leftist leaders with ambivalent views of the U.
President Barack Obama visited Brazil in 2011 to try to improve ties.
The election also revived questions about the depth of corruption in Brazil, long seen as an obstacle to development.
The election returns the 66-year-old Marxist rebel-turned-economist to power at a precarious moment for the resource-rich nation.
They are worried that four more years of her administration’s policies, including subsidizing gasoline prices, capping electricity rates and boosting government spending to juice the economy, may deepen Brazil’s downturn.
Brazilian voters went to the polls on Sunday, October 5, 2014 to choose a       President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, as well as members of the       country s bicameral legislature, the National Congress.
However, no candidate       attained an absolute majority in the presidential election, and therefore       a runoff vote was held on Sunday, October 26, 2014.
The election statistics presented in this space come from data issued by       the Higher Electoral Court , which has 2014 election       results in Portuguese.
The 1988 constitution stipulates that the Federative Republic of Brazil is       a legal democratic state, in which all power emanates from the people, who       exercise it by means of elected representatives or directly.
Both the federal       government and the governments of Brazil s 26 states consist of executive,       legislative and judicial branches; likewise, the Federal District, where       the capital city of Brasilia is located, has its own government and legislature.
Two groups sought to       re-establish the Brazilian Labour Party  PTB  of the late president Getúlio       Vargas, who ruled Brazil as a dictator from 1930 to 1945, and as a democratically       elected president from 1951 until 1954, when he committed suicide.
These four parties, along with the Workers  Party  PT , headed       by union leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, took part in the 1982 election       - Brazil s first free election in two decades.
The military government had planned a controlled transition to democracy       through the indirect election of a civilian president in a PDS-dominated       electoral college, and the ruling party went on to choose Paulo Maluf as       its presidential candidate.
Maluf, a former governor of São Paulo,       was  and remains  an extremely controversial figure in Brazil, linked to       numerous corruption scandals over the course of his political career.
However,       Neves - who had been governor of Minas Gerais since 1982, and prime minister       of Brazil from 1961 to 1962, during a short-lived period of parliamentary       government - fell gravely ill shortly before taking office and died after       repeated surgery; José Sarney, vice-president elect and a PDS dissident,       took over the presidency.
Meanwhile, the Cruzado Plan collapsed       shortly after the 1986 election, and once again inflation spiraled out of       control; eventually, the PMDB-PFL coalition broke apart.
In 1988, Brazil promulgated the new constitution, its eighth in history.
A total of twenty-one candidates ran in the 1989 presidential election, the       first held by popular vote since 1960.
In the       runoff vote, Collor prevailed over Lula, becoming Brazil s youngest president.
In the 1994 presidential election, Cardoso ran       as the candidate of his party, the PSDB.
In the 1998 presidential       election, Cardoso - who had successfully persuaded Congress to amend the       constitution and allow presidential re-election for a single term - was       re-elected on the first round by an absolute majority, with Lula in second       place once again.
In the 2002 presidential election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ran for       the fourth straight time as the PT candidate, but his campaign now emphasized        change without rupture.
This pragmatic approach proved to be successful:       in the first round of voting, Lula outpolled his closest adversary, the PSDB s       José Serra, by a two-to-one margin, but fell short of an absolute       majority; in the runoff election, Lula da Silva won the presidency by the       largest vote margin ever recorded in the history of Brazil.
Nonetheless,       Lula was not directly linked to the aforementioned scandals, and he prevailed       decisively over the PSDB s Geraldo Alckmin in the 2006 presidential election,       albeit PT lost ground in the legislative contests and finished second - behind       PMDB - in the Chamber of Deputies.
Who should lead Brazil, Dilma Rousseff or Marina Silva?
Which of the two frontrunners in the October 5 presidential elections will do what it takes to turn Brazil around and pull one of the most important economies of the emerging market world from the slump it’s been in over the past few years?
For investors who have been down on Brazil in the tenure of current president Rousseff, the pendulum seems to be swinging in favor of Silva, a former environment minister who came into the limelight in August after presidential hopeful Eduardo Campos and environmental party candidate died in a plane crash.
Silva has outlined a market-friendly plan that both businesses on the ground in Brazil as well as foreign investors believe will spur productivity and encourage investment, both of which seriously tailed off under Rousseff.
Although Brazil has been impacted to a large extent by the global slowdown, in particular in the commodities space, several policies undertaken by the Rousseff administration have also contributed largely to its economic woes, Shearing said.
Certain policy decisions have negatively impacted industries like utilities and though Rousseff had hinted at helping the ailing Petrobras  Brazil’s state-owned oil company , which is losing a lot of money from importing refined products, that did not come through, and the overall uncertain environment has held back investment spending in Brazil, both domestically as well as from overseas.
We’ve seen unemployment remain low in Brazil and no signs of deflation, which means that the slowdown has been less painful, but more importantly, it means that the remedies needed are more difficult to achieve.
Whether Silva is capable of that remains to be seen and for now, the race is extremely tight, meaning that the election will in all likelihood go into a second round on October 26th.
There’s also a hope she may be more realistic with respect to infrastructure programs in terms of the returns that investors can get on projects, since Brazil badly needs infrastructure and in her first term, the interest rates were just not attractive enough for most investors.
There are more than 20 political parties and whoever wins this election will have to form coalitions, which means that getting things done will not be easy.
Angela Bouzanis, Country Expert, Brazil, FOCUSECONOMICS: “Rousseff has signaled that she won’t drastically alter economic policy if reelected.
She argues that the waning economy is due to external pressures and cites Brazil’s low unemployment rate as a reason to continue with current policies.
Silva has vowed to reform Brazil’s political establishment and overhaul economic policy.
Nevertheless, Rousseff has proven that she can rule Brazil effectively and push legislation through Congress.

Brazil’s third televised presidential debate was held Tuesday night, as the candidates seek to win over voters ahead of the October 5 general election.
This is widely seen as an attempt to win over market investors opposed to the greater role played by Brazil s government in the nation’s economy.
Silva has sought to play on her evangelical credentials to appeal to Brazil’s fastest growing religious group.

Young boys in Brazil idolize the all-time greats, from Pele to Neymar, whose humble beginnings have inspired a narrative of soccer as an equalizer, a path out of poverty, and an escape from the favelas and the drugs and violence that plague them.
The question now is whether the aftershocks of Brazil’s soccer exit will continue to be felt this October, when the country takes to the polls to elect its president.
These concerns developed in the greater context of the political protests that have wracked Brazil since last summer, with protesters largely demanding that the government take meaningful steps to address poverty and inequality in the country – among the most unequal in the Americas.
The defeat  and Brazilians’ deeply emotional reaction  fueled speculation over the likely impact on Brazil’s presidential elections this fall.
Of course, a reality that is easy to forget when the country is caught up in the excitement of the World Cup is that Brazil is much bigger than soccer.
In 1998, when Brazil lost to France in the finals, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was reelected in the first round; when they won their fifth title in 2002, Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva, then in opposition, was elected to his first term.
True, new polling has yet to be completed since Brazil’s defeat, and Dilma remains the favorite in the fall’s elections.

A third candidate, Aécio Neves, has also endeared himself to the markets, but his chances of winning the election are smaller.

Voting in Brazil is mandatory and elections have to be supervised by assistants in each polling station.
In this article, we will learn more about election assistants in Brazil.
Justifications for not being able to carry out the role of election assistant must be presented to the judge of their Electoral Zone within five days of receiving the summons.
All people owning a Voter Registration Card , older than 18 years old and having no legal issues related to the Electoral Justice are eligible to be summoned or can volunteer themselves to be an election assistant.
Those who fulfill the requirements - mentioned above - to be an election assistant but were not summoned can voluntarily apply for it, through the Mesário Voluntário program.
To voluntarily apply to be an election assistant, the individual must contact the nearest TRE office to know if the program has been implemented.
The responsibilities of all election assistants are described in the Electoral Law.

Brazilians vote today in the most unpredictable presidential election in decades and the first since the end of an economic boom underpinning the leftist Workers’ Party’s 12-year rule.
Polls now show Ms Rousseff as the front runner in a race that is likely to go to a runoff on October 26th, following one of the most competitive campaigns since Brazil returned to democracy in 1985.
The death of one candidate, the unexpected surge of another, and bitter marketing by Ms Rousseff to claw back into the lead have contributed to a nail-biter election as uncertain as the course of the country itself.
More than 140 million people are registered to vote in Brazil, where everyone between the ages of 18 and 70 is required to cast a ballot.
Ms Rousseff’s main rivals are Marina Silva , a hero of the global conservation movement and ruling party defector now with the Brazilian Socialist Party , and Aecio Neves, a senator and former state governor from the centrist party that laid the groundwork for Brazil’s economic boom last decade.
With the clock ticking in Brazil’s tight presidential election, celebrities from sports stars to supermodels are offering endorsements in last-ditch efforts to get their candidates over the line.
I will support candidate Aecio Neves because I identify myself a lot with his proposal for Brazil,” Neymar said in a Youtube broadcast that resembled the tear-stained address he made to the nation when he had to exit the World Cup with a back injury.

Rousseff s Workers’ Party has been in power for 12 years, since her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva became the first left-of-center presidential candidate to be elected in Brazil s post-dictatorship era.
The decade that followed his 2002 election was marked by an economic boom, the rise of millions out of poverty and Brazil s emergence on the world stage.
The incumbent, a former left-wing guerrilla who is Brazil s first female president, is likely to rely on her solid support among Brazil s poor, especially those who have benefited from government social programs, and to remind voters how much better things are than they were 12 years ago.
This post has been updated with poll results indicating President Dilma Rousseff will face challenger Aecio Neves in a presidential election runoff and additional quotes.

How will the Brazilian presidential election unfold?
If no presidential candidate secures 50 percent of the vote, a runoff election will be held on October 26.
The upcoming elections are likely to bring major changes at the national level—though incumbent governors are largely poised to claim victory at the state level—that could significantly alter the course of Brazil’s domestic and international policies.
After five presidential election cycles, the see-saw rivalry between the coalition led by the Workers’ Party  PT  and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  seems to have come to an end.
As former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  PT  summed up, the death of Eduardo Campos ended one election and the entrance of Marina Silva marked the start of a new one.
If Dilma wins the election by a significant margin, the political cycle that began with Lula assuming office in 2003 will continue for another four years.
Dilma would have little incentive to change Brazil’s foreign policy or even the current minister of foreign affairs.
Marina could win the election by a large margin if the 19 percent of likely first-round votes for Aécio Neves  PSDB, party of former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso  migrate en masse to her candidacy.
Both the number of parties and the degree of fragmentation is expected to grow after the election, making it more difficult to create and maintain stable majorities.
Marina has given little indication that she would promote substantial changes in Brazil’s foreign policy, with the exception of trade policy.
Relationships with neighbors in South America favored under the PT administration as well as Brazil, Russia, India, and China  BRIC  engagement may no longer be top priorities.
Whether it s a Marina or a Dilma victory, Brazil is likely to see a break from the last four years.
Whether it’s a Marina or a Dilma victory under this last scenario, Brazil is likely to see a break from the last four years.

There’s a lot going on in the world these days, so you may not have been paying attention to Brazil.
But the country has an extremely important election coming up this weekend – one that will decide amongst other things, who their president will be for the next four years.
The reason this election is so important is because it is more or less a referendum on the incumbent party, the Partido dos Trablhadores  PT  — the “Worker’s Party,” who has ushered in an unprecedented era of prosperity in Brazil for people across almost all backgrounds.
This is also the first election after massive, nationwide protests  led largely by young upper and lower middle class urban residents , against government spending on mega events like the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympics.
Fed up in general with “the establishment,” many Brazilian voters are so disillusioned with politics that in this traditionally left-leaning, post-right military dictatorship society, the right has made surprising gains in this election.
So, what’s going on in Brazil, and what’s at stake in this referendum on the PT?
In terms of what’s at stake, as The Guardian points out , this vote will send a signal to the world weather or not Brazil will take a more global capitalist, U.
South American stance that has grown in Brazil and neighboring countries in the past years.
However with Brazil’s economic miracle showing signs of waning , perhaps more importantly, this is a referendum on the state-led social programs that the PT has attempted to implement over the last years.
Emblematic of this is the comment that a university-educated, engineer-turned-taxista made to me recently — that black people in Brazil don’t know how to vote in their own favor, and that they only vote for the PT because of the Bolsa Familia, a program that is really holding them back.
But Neves’ close second finish in the first round and the election of the most conservative Congress in the post-1964 period indicates that there’s a diversity of support for the right.
However, my favorite quote from Rio Gringa’s article really explains the social and political dynamic of contemporary Brazil, and really most middle-income nations of the global South.
In Brazil, like Nigeria, Angola, South Africa, and similar “big” growing economies, the popular culture often illustrates the dreams and desires of young people to participate in the global information age and consumerist economy.
A prime example of this in Brazil is the violence carried out by Military Police on favela residents in Rio, and particularly young men of color whom are usually just seen in the public sphere as “thugs” and drug dealers .
In Brazil, a place where in the last few years, the lower classes have fully entered in to the consumerist economy  whether by state engineering or not  — and are existing in an economy that is fully dependent on materialist consumerism — the perceived gains achieved by economic inclusion plans such as Bolsa Familia, are thinner than they perhaps seem.
Until last month Silva was the vice presidential candidate of the smallest of Brazil’s three main parties, a woman with a national reputation as an environmental activist but little prospect of high political office.
President Dilma Rousseff was cruising serenely toward re-election in the first round of the elections on Oct.
With the election campaign already under way, the PSB had no choice but to promote Silva in his place, and suddenly the election became a real race.
A woman as president is no longer an innovation in Brazil.
A dramatic back story — Silva is the daughter of illiterate rubber tappers in the Amazon, and only learned to read when she was 16 — is also not unusual in a Brazilian president: Rousseff was tortured and jailed by the military dictators who ruled Brazil in the 1970s.
All very well, but what would Silva do as the president of Brazil?
It’s an important question, because Brazil, the world’s fifth-largest country  200 million people , is going through difficult times.
No political party in Brazil ever calls itself “right-wing.
She accepted Albuquerque as a running mate because she needs to appeal to the agribusiness sector, which accounts for almost half of Brazil’s exports and a quarter of the economy.
Last year s mass protests in Brazil drew attention to health-care spending—an issue that could be in the spotlight again ahead of October s national election.
But Brazil s Health Minister Arthur Chioro defended that budget by saying that “federal spending on public health has been steadily increasing on both an annual and a per-capita basis”.
As a result, today, 75% of Brazil s 195 million people benefit from public health care, managed and provided by all levels of government—municipal, state, and federal.
However, in Brazil, private and public health-care systems overlap, an interface which can be cooperative.
In Brazil, where 70% of the hospitals  and 69% of all hospital beds  are private and 30% of the hospitals  and 31% of all hospital beds  are public, poorer Brazilians without private health plans who need in-patient treatment in overcrowded, understaffed, and under-equipped public hospitals, often have to wait a long time to get in.
To help public hospitals handle this overflow, private hospitals make 50% of their beds available to SUS patients, so that nearly 66% of all hospital beds in Brazil are available to SUS patients.
Public hospital overcrowding is most acute in big cities, where most of Brazil s population is concentrated.
In Brazil, federal, state, and municipal governments are supposed to work cooperatively to offer public health care, something they don t do in Rio.
The Family Health Program, created in 1994, when it began treating 1 million people, is Brazil s main delivery system for primary health care.
Today, 35 305 teams of doctors, nurses, nurse s assistants, dentists and medical technicians in the ESF treat 109 million people, 56% of the population, in all Brazil s 5560 municipalities.
The More Doctors programme is the most important measure adopted by SUS since its creation”, said Health Minister Chioro, “It has already increased basic health-care services throughout Brazil.
BRASILIA, Brazil – Leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff and Social Democratic challenger Aecio Neves are fighting to break a statistical tie in the polls a week out from next Sunday s  October 26  presidential runoff.
With the Petrobras scandal also haunting her administration – though his own party has not escaped allegations of wrongdoing – Neves insists that  Brazil cannot take another four years of misgovernment on this scale.
Rousseff fired back by unsubtly referring to 2011 reports of Neves refusing to take a breathalyzer test and insisting that his party, which ruled Brazil for 8 years before Lula triumphed in 2002, would seek to unpick the welfare reforms which have won international renown.
This is an extremely divisive election.
After 12 years of PT rule there is a rising anti-PT tide – this election is more polarized than any we have seen since 1989,  says political consultant Andre Cesar.
Positive news out of Brazil to start the week has provided the country’s stock market with a much-needed boost.
Running under the Brazilian Social Democratic Party  PSDB , Neves is a business man who has pushed for increased trade and lower government spending; he s what many people believe will help bring Brazil out of its current economic downturn.

Ambev is down 10 percent over the last six months, but has spiked 4 percent on the election news.
As of this writing, Rousseff is the favorite to remain president of the country, but as the first election displayed, anything can happen.
Can Brazil s stock market predict an election?
Now that the World Cup is over, media attention has shifted away from Brazil for the time being, but only temporarily.
Brazil has an upcoming general election in October to decide both the President and National Congress, which can have far-reaching effects on related markets.
In the case of Brazil, Rousseff s approval rating has been steadily declining since last year, which is not surprising when you look at investor sentiment.
The Bovespa, Brazil s benchmark stock index, dropped nearly 40% since Rousseff took office to the July 2013 low.
The stock market is one of the best barometers available for gauging and tracking public sentiment, and it is clear that it has overall been poor in Brazil over the past three years.
However, when equities were in a strong downtrend during a second-term election, the incumbent was ousted.
Therefore, it is very possible, even likely in my opinion, that the Bovespa will remain in an upswing come October when the actual election happens.
The technical side of analysis is already suggesting this; all we need is the right fundamental catalyst to come along, which the upcoming general election will serve perfectly for.

CURITIBA, Brazil — With their hands raised, hundreds of Pentecostal churchgoers worshipped Sunday night in Brazil, seeking divine blessings for themselves and for a nation electing its next president.
At the same moment, pollsters were revealing that Brazil had delivered a stunning rebuke to the Pentecostal presidential candidate Marina Silva, who failed to advance to a second-round runoff just weeks after being projected to win it all.

With days to go until Brazil s presidential election, the race for the top is tightening.
If Dilma Rousseff  PT  fails to win the fifty percent majority on election day, a second round will be held on October 26th.
RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL — With her unconditional backing of former president Lula, some had suggested incumbent president Dilma Rousseff could win the 2014 election in the first round of the 2014 elections.
The first stage of Brazil’s general election will take place on October 5th and, if Dilma Rousseff, representing the Workers Party  PT  fails to win the fifty percent majority, a second round will be held on October 26th.
These have been seen as important elections at a crucial moment in Brazil’s development and eleven candidates are running for the country’s top job, the most since 1998.
Having served time in jail for her association with a Marxist guerrilla group under Brazil’s dictatorship, Rousseff worked her way through the ranks of the PT party to eventually be Chief of Staff.
Silva’s environmental record and humble background provide good public support but she is distrusted by Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector and some think her campaign is one of paradoxes.
An outspoken Evangelical Christian, Silva is also linked to Brazil’s biggest private bank, Itau that represents the country’s growing oligarchy.
In second position for much of the run up to the election, Aécio Neves the candidate for the center-right PSDB has been pushed into third place and his previous hopes of attracting those who want “anyone but Dilma” look unlikely to come through.
Currently in fourth place, Pastor Everaldo Pereira represents the right wing Social Christian Party  PSC  and has considerable popularity among Brazil’s growing number of evangelical worshipers and leaders.
Until last month Silva was the vice-presidential candidate of the smallest of Brazil’s three main parties, a woman with a national reputation as an environmental activist but little prospect of high political office.
President Dilma Rousseff was cruising serenely towards re-election in the first round of the elections on Oct.
With the election campaign already underway, the PSB had no choice but to promote Silva in his place, and suddenly the election became a real race.
All very well, but what would Marina Silva actually do as the president of Brazil?
It’s an important question, because Brazil, the world’s fifth largest country  200 million people , is going through difficult times.
She accepted Albuquerque as a running mate because she needs to appeal to the agribusiness sector, which accounts for almost half of Brazil’s exports and a quarter of the economy.
Now, Rousseff is moving towards the next point on her agenda: winning October’s presidential election.
While President Rousseff is highly favored to win re-election, an economic recession as well as further corruption cases in Petrobras, the country’s multinational oil and gas company, could harm her chances.
To show her determination to Brazilians and to win re-election, Rousseff needs to revive the Brazilian economy and reduce government corruption before October.
Of all respondents in Brazil, 58% expect inflation to rise.
This has frustrated voters who despite still supporting Rousseff’s re-election compare her presidency to Lula’s, who oversaw growth in employment and the economy.
On the other hand, as the July poll shows, the president needs to gain the vote from non-PT voters, meaning that economic reforms need to take place before October to demonstrate that she is serious about restarting Brazil’s economy even if it means cutting popular social programs.
Meanwhile, Brazil’s oil giant Petrobras is tangled in scandal as corruption allegations grow.
Dilma Vana Rousseff, the 36th and current President of Brazil.

A law requiring full-time domestic workers – of which there are a lot in Brazil, thanks to its crushing inequality – to be treated as formal employees , with maximum work hours, minimum wages and social security, was another recent annoyance for the  haves .
A counter-narrative that the country under the PT is on the road to ruin has filled the media in Brazil, which is mostly against the government, and the international press.
Another opposition theme in the last election, which has been recently resurrected, is that Brazil should be more friendly to the US and its highly unpopular foreign policy in the region.
The reality around Brazil s economic policy is that the government, since the end of 2010, has listened to  big finance  a bit too much, raising interest rates and cutting spending when the economy was too weak.

As campaigning for the upcoming general election kicks off in Brazil, the government has launched a range of apps intended to improve citizen engagement and inclusion in the process.
A separate application will inform citizens about the voting process in Brazil, where voting is compulsory, such as wards and electoral divisions and will use geo positioning to inform the best route to get to the voting location.
Another tool, also yet to be released, will inform real-time results once the actual election starts.
Since 1996, voting in Brazil uses compact, portable voting devices and a centralized process that is able to process even close elections within hours.
The laws that regulate the electoral process in Brazil specify lots of data that any candidate must supply in order to have his or her candidacy officially registered and being legally able to stand for election.
