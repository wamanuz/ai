This article is about the war in Afghanistan from 2001 onwards.
For the previous phases of this conflict, see War in Afghanistan  1978–present  .
For other wars, see War in Afghanistan .
The War in Afghanistan  2001–present  refers to the intervention by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  NATO  and allied forces in the ongoing Afghan civil war .
The war followed the September 11 attacks , and its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and denying it a safe basis of operation in Afghanistan   by removing the Taliban from power.
S.
President George W.
Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda.
The United States refused to negotiate and launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the United Kingdom .
The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance .
S.
Taliban from power and built military bases near major cities across the country.
In 2003, NATO assumed leadership of ISAF, with troops from 43 countries.
NATO members provided the core of the force.
S.
S.
Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement and in 2003 launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.
While ISAF continued to battle the Taliban insurgency, fighting crossed into neighboring North-West Pakistan .
32] In 2004, the Pakistani Army began to clash with local tribes hosting al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.
The US military launched drone attacks in Pakistan to kill insurgent leaders.
This resulted in the start of an insurgency in Waziristan in 2007.
On 2 May 2011, United States Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad , Pakistan.
In May 2012, NATO leaders endorsed an exit strategy for withdrawing their forces.
UN-backed peace talks have since taken place between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
33] In May 2014, the United States announced that its combat operations would end in 2014, leaving just a small residual force in the country until the end of 2016.
As of 2013, tens of thousands of people had been killed in the war.
Over 4,000 ISAF soldiers and civilian contractors as well as over 10,000 Afghan National Security Forces had been killed.
Afghanistan s political order began to break down with the overthrow of King Zahir Shah by his cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan in a bloodless 1973 coup .
Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, emancipation of women, and Pashtun nationalism .
This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive Pashtun population.
In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began to encourage Afghan Islamic leaders such as Burhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , to fight against the regime.
In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in a coup by Afghan s Communist Party , his former partner in government, known as the People s Democratic Party of Afghanistan  PDPA .
PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership.
This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition from Islamic leaders across rural areas.
The PDPA s crackdown was met with open rebellion, including Ismail Khan  s Herat Uprising .
The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when Hafizullah Amin ousted Nur Muhammad Taraki .
The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, intervened militarily three months later , to depose Amin and install another PDA faction led by Babrak Karmal .
The entry of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its Cold War rivals, the United States , Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan .
In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously-motivated mujahideen held sway in much of the countryside.
Beside Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included Jalaluddin Haqqani .
The CIA worked closely with Pakistan s Inter-Service Intelligence to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen.
The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as   Afghan Arabs  , including Osama bin Laden .
After the withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan in May 1989, the PDPA regime under Najibullah held on until 1992, when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum cleared the approach to Kabul .
With the political stage cleared of Afghan socialists, the remaining Islamic warlords vied for power.
By then, Bin Laden had left the country.
The United States  interest in Afghanistan also diminished.
In 1994, Mullah Omar, a Pashtun , a mujahideen who taught at a Pakistani madrassa , returned to Kandahar and founded the Taliban.
His followers were religious students, known as the Talib and they sought to end warlordism through strict adherence to Islamic law .
By November 1994, the Taliban had captured all of Kandahar Province.
They declined the government s offer to join in a coalition government and marched on Kabul in 1995.
The Taliban s early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of costly defeats.
40] Pakistan provided strong support to the Taliban.
41]  Analysts such as Amin Saikal described the group as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan s regional interests, which the Taliban denied.
41] The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995, but were driven back by Massoud.
On 27 September 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia , seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan .
44] They imposed their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school, or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.
45] According to the Pakistani expert Ahmed Rashid ,  between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan  on the side of the Taliban.
Massoud and Dostum, former arch-enemies, created a United Front against the Taliban, commonly known as the Northern Alliance .
48] In addition to Massoud s Tajik force and Dostum s Uzbeks , the United Front included Hazara factions and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq and Haji Abdul Qadir .
Abdul Haq also gathered a limited number of defecting Pashtun Taliban.
49] Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah .
47] International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which the journalist Steve Coll referred to as the  grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance , said,  It s crazy that you have this today … Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara … They were all ready to buy in to the process … to work under the king s banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan.    The Northern Alliance received varying degrees of support from Russia, Iran, Tajikistan and India.
The Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998 and drove Dostum into exile.
The conflict was brutal.
According the United Nations  UN , the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians.
UN officials stated that there had been  15 massacres  between 1996 and 2001.
The Taliban especially targeted the Shiite Hazaras.
52]  In retaliation for the execution of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by Uzbek general Abdul Malik Pahlawan in 1997, the Taliban executed about 4,000 civilians after taking Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998.
Bin Laden s so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.
56] The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing  Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people .
By 2001, the Taliban controlled as much as 90% of the country, with the Northern Alliance confined to the country s northeast corner.
Fighting alongside Taliban forces were some 28,000–30,000 Pakistanis and 2,000–3,000 Al Qaeda militants.
39]    Many of the Pakistanis were recruited from madrassas.
S.
State Department confirmed that  20–40 percent of  Taliban soldiers are Pakistani.  The document said that many of the parents of those Pakistani nationals  know nothing regarding their child s military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan .
S.
State Department report and reports by Human Rights Watch, other Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan were regular soldiers, especially from the Frontier Corps , but also from the army providing direct combat support.
In August 1996, Bin Laden was forced to leave Sudan and arrived in Jalabad, Afghanistan.
He had founded Al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the mujahideen s war against the Soviets, but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords.
He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al Qaeda s operations to eastern Afghanistan.
S.
Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists , and plot terrorist actions.
60] While al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan , it also supported training camps of other organizations.
An estimated 10,000 and 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9 11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front.
A smaller number were inducted into al-Qaeda.
S.
Embassy bombings were linked to bin Laden, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes on militant training camps in Afghanistan.
S.
Taliban to surrender bin Laden.
In 1999, the international community imposed sanctions on the Taliban, calling for bin Laden to be surrendered.
The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands.
Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  Special Activities Division paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden.
These teams planned several operations, but did not receive the order to proceed from President Clinton.
Their efforts built relationships with Afghan leaders that proved essential in the 2001 invasion.
S.
S.
Pakistan and until 1998–1999 had no clear policy toward Afghanistan.
S.
State Department s Robin Raphel told Massoud to surrender to the Taliban.
Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban.
39] Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban.
They insisted it was the time for a cease-fire and an arms embargo .
At the time, Pakistan began a   Berlin-like airlift to resupply and re-equip the Taliban , financed with Saudi money.
S.
S.
Subsequently, Osama bin Laden was indicted for his involvement in the embassy bombings.
S.
S.
Afghanistan.
64] The only collaboration between Massoud and the US at the time was an effort with the CIA to trace bin Laden following the 1998 bombings.
S.
European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.
By 2001 the change of policy sought by CIA officers who knew Massoud was underway.
66] CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counter-terrorist Center, began to draft a formal finding for President George W.
Bush  s signature, authorizing a covert action program in Afghanistan.
It would be the first in a decade to seek to influence the course of the Afghan war in favor of Massoud.
44] Richard A.
Clarke , chair of the Counter-Terrorism Security Group under the Clinton administration, and later an official in the Bush administration, allegedly presented a plan to incoming Bush National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in January 2001.
A change in US policy was effected in August 2001.
44] The Bush administration agreed on a plan to start supporting Massoud.
A meeting of top national security officials agreed that the Taliban would be presented with an ultimatum to hand over bin Laden and other al-Qaeda operatives.
If the Taliban refused, the US would provide covert military aid to anti-Taliban groups.
Ahmad Shah Massoud was the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan.
In the areas under his control, Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women s Rights Declaration.
68] As a consequence, many civilians had fled to areas under his control.
69]  In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban.
In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss  a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan .
72] That part of the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually develop.
Among those in attendance was Hamid Karzai.
In early 2001, Massoud, with other ethnic leaders, addressed the European Parliament in Brussels, asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan.
71] He said that the Taliban and al-Qaeda had introduced  a very wrong perception of Islam  and that without the support of Pakistan and Osama bin Laden, the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for another year.
S.
On 9 September 2001, Massoud was critically wounded in a suicide attack by two Arabs posing as journalists, who detonated a bomb hidden in their video camera during an interview in Khoja Bahauddin, in the Takhar Province of Afghanistan.
76]  Massoud died in the helicopter taking him to a hospital.
The funeral, held in a rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning Afghans.
S.
Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked.
78]  The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda s Hamburg cell –  intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City , killing everyone on board and thousands working in the buildings.
Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others.

No flights had survivors.
Nearly 3,000 people, including the 19 hijackers, died in the attacks.
81] According to the New York State Health Department, 836 responders, including firefighters and police personnel, had died as of June 2009.
On 11 September, Taliban foreign minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil  denounce the terrorist attack, whoever is behind it .
82] The following day, President Bush called the attacks more than just  acts of terror  but  acts of war  and resolved to pursue and conquer an  enemy  that would no longer be safe in  its harbors .
83] The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Salam Zaeef said on 13 September that the Taliban would consider extraditing bin Laden if there was solid evidence linking him to the attacks.
84] Though Osama bin Laden eventually took responsibility for the 9 11 attacks in 2004 , he denied having any involvement in a statement issued on 17 September 2001 and by interview on 29 September 2001.
The State Department, in a memo dated 14 September, demanded that the Taliban surrender all known al-Qaeda associates in Afghanistan, provide intelligence on bin Laden and his affiliates and expel all terrorists from Afghanistan.
88] On 18 September, the director of Pakistan s Inter-Services Intelligence , Mahmud Ahmed conveyed these demands to Mullah Omar and the senior Taliban leadership, whose response was  not negative on all points .
89] Mahmud reported that the Taliban leadership was in  deep introspection  and waiting for the recommendation of a grand council of religious clerics that was assembling to decide the matter.
89] On 20 September, President Bush, in an address to Congress, demanded the Taliban deliver bin Laden and destroy al Qaeda bases.
In the days and weeks immediately following 9 11, when the Taliban sought evidence of his involvement in the attacks, Osama bin Laden repeatedly denied having any role.
The same day, a grand council of over 1,000 Muslim clerics from across Afghanistan that had convened to decide bin Laden s fate, issued a fatwa , expressing sadness for the deaths in the 9 11 attacks, urging bin Laden to leave their country and calling on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to conduct an independent investigation of  recent events to clarify the reality and prevent harassment of innocent people .
91] The fatwa went on to warn that should the United States not agree with its decision and invade Afghanistan,   jihad becomes an order for all Muslims.   White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer rejected the response, saying the time for talk had ended and it was time for action.

The evidence, however, was not made public prior to the outbreak of war.
S.
Zaeef said the Taliban were ready, if necessary, for war with the United States.
S.
Great Britain and the Soviet Union in previous centuries.
Zaeef reiterated the demand for evidence of bin Laden s involvement in the 9 11 attacks.
This is an international principle.
S.
S.
94] The evidence was not made public but instead shown to Pakistan s government whose leaders later stated that the materials they had seen  provide sufficient basis for indictment in a court of law .

S.
Ambassador to Pakistan that while the Taliban was  weak and ill-prepared to face the American onslaught ,  real victory will come through negotiations  for if the Taliban were eliminated, Afghanistan would revert to warlordism.
97] On 28 September, he led a delegation of eight Pakistani religious leaders to persuade Mullah Omar to accept having religious leaders from Islamic countries examine the evidence and decide bin Laden s fate.
Mullah Omar was noncommittal.

S.
Department of Defense under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , was exploring ways to broaden the military response beyond Afghanistan.
S.
S.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld urged a broader military response to the 9 11 attacks, going beyond regime change in Afghanistan to  another key State  or two  that support terrorism .
On 1 October, Mullah Omar agreed to a proposal by Qazi Hussain Ahmad , the head of Pakistan s most important Islamic party, the Jamaat-i-Islami , to have bin Laden taken to Pakistan where he would be held under house arrest in Peshawar and tried by an international tribunal.
Pakistan s president Pervez Musharraf blocked the plan because he could not guarantee bin Laden s safety.
S.
Afghan King Zahir Shah .
101] The British Prime Minister Tony Blair called on the Taliban to  surrender the terrorists or surrender power .
102] Mullah Omar warned that unlike the former King s government, which was overthrown in 1973 and surrendered, the Taliban  would just retreat to the mountains  and continue to fight.
S.
S.
NATO commander George Robertson said the evidence was  clear and compelling .
S.
S.
President Bush rejected the offer as non-negotiable.
106] On 16 October, Muttawakil, the Taliban foreign minister, dropped the condition to see evidence and offered to send bin Laden to a third country in return for a halt to the bombing.
107] US officials also rejected this offer.
108] At that time, some Afghan experts said the United States failed to recognize the Taliban s need for a  face-saving formula .
109] In 2007, bin Laden claimed that the Taliban had no knowledge of his plans for the 9 11 attacks.
On 14 September 2001 Congress passed legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists , which was signed on 18 September 2001 by President Bush.
S.
Armed Forces against those responsible for the 9 11 attacks.
The Bush administration, for its part, did not seek a declaration of war and labeled Taliban troops as supporters of terrorists rather than soldiers.
It thus defined them as outside the protections of the Geneva Convention and the due process of law.
S.

111] Military lawyers responsible for prosecuting detainees had questioned some of the policies.
Internal disputes were revealed years later.
S.
Security Council  has authorized it, or where it is in self-defence under article 51 of the Charter.
UN Charter.
Defenders of the invasion argued that UNSC authorization was not required, since the invasion was an act of collective self-defense provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter.
114]  Specifically, it is argued that a series of UN Security Council Resolutions concerning Afghanistan provided for the possibility of establishing that the Taliban were indirectly responsibility for al-Qaeda’s attacks  and although the initial invasion of Afghanistan was not mandated by a specific UN Security Council Resolution, the Security Council moved quickly to authorize a military operation to stabilize the country.
114] Critics claimed that the invasion was illegitimate under Article 51 because the 9 11 attacks were not  armed attacks  by another state, but were perpetrated by non-state actors.
They alleged that the attackers had no proven connection to Afghanistan or the Taliban.
Critics claimed that even if a state had made the 9 11 attacks, no bombing campaign would constitute self-defense.
On 20 December 2001, more than two months after the attack began, the UNSC authorized the creation of International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  to assist the Afghan Interim Authority in maintaining security.
118] Command of ISAF passed to NATO on 11 August 2003, following the US invasion of Iraq in March of that year.
S.
Afghanistan.
Airstrikes were reported in Kabul, at the airport, at Kandahar  home of Mullah Omar , and in the city of Jalalabad.
120] The day before the bombing commenced, Human Rights Watch issued a report in which they urged that no military support be given to the Northern Alliance due to their human rights record.
At 17:00 UTC, President Bush confirmed the strikes and Prime Minister Blair addressed his nation.
Bush stated that Taliban military sites and terrorist training grounds would be targeted.
Food, medicine and supplies would be dropped to  the starving and suffering men, women and children of Afghanistan .
Earlier Bin Laden had released a video in which he condemned all attacks in Afghanistan.
UK and US special forces joined the Northern Alliance and other Afghan opposition groups to take Herat in November 2001.
Canada and Australia also deployed forces.
Other countries provided basing, access and overflight permission.

The strikes initially focused on Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar.
Within a few days, most Taliban training sites were severely damaged and air defenses were destroyed.
The campaign focused on command, control, and communications targets.
The front facing the Northern Alliance held, and no battlefield successes were achieved there.
Two weeks into the campaign, the Northern Alliance demanded the air campaign focus more on the front lines.

At the beginning of November, allied forces attacked front lines with daisy cutter bombs and AC-130 gunships .
By 2 November, Taliban frontal positions were devastated and a march on Kabul seemed possible.

Bush went to New York City on 10 November 2001 to address the United Nations .
S.
His words had impact.
Al-Qaeda fighters took over security in Afghan cities.
The Northern Alliance troops planned to seize Mazar-i-Sharif , cutting off Taliban supply lines and enabling equipment to arrive from the north and then attack Kabul.
S.
Special Forces and intelligence officers with a military background liased with Afghan militias and advanced after the Taliban was disrupted by air power .
The Tora Bora Mountains lie roughly east of Kabul, on the Pakistan border.
American analysts believed that the Taliban and al-Qaeda had dug in behind fortified networks of caves and underground bunkers.
The area was subjected to a heavy B-52 bombardment.
S.
Northern Alliance objectives began to diverge.
S.
Osama bin Laden, the Northern Alliance wanted to finish off the Taliban.
Mazari-i Sharif was important because it is the home of the Shrine of Hazrat Ali or  Blue Mosque , a sacred Muslim site and because it is a significant transportation hub with two major airports and a major supply route leading into Uzbekistan .
132] Taking the city would enable humanitarian aid to alleviate a looming food crisis, which threatened more than six million people with starvation.
Many of those in most urgent need lived in rural areas to the south and west of Mazar-i-Sharif.
132]  On 9 November 2001, Northern Alliance forces, under the command of Dostum and Ustad Atta Mohammed Noor , overcame resistance crossing the Pul-i-Imam Bukhri bridge,   and seized the city s main military base and airport.
S.
Special Forces Operational Detachment A-595, CIA paramilitary officers and United States Air Force Combat Control Team    on horseback and with close air support, took part in the push into Mazari Sharif.
After a bloody 90-minute battle, Taliban forces withdrew after holding the city since 1998, triggering celebrations.
S.
Central Command  CENTCOM  had originally believed that the city would remain in Taliban hands well into the following year  and any potential battle would require  a very slow advance .
S.
10th Mountain Division were airlifted into the city, providing the first solid position from which Kabul and Kandahar could be reached.
S.
Air Force now had an airport to allow them to fly more sorties for resupply missions and humanitarian aid.
These missions allowed shipments of humanitarian aid to be immediately shipped to Afghans facing starvation on the northern plain.

On the night of 12 November, Taliban forces fled Kabul under cover of darkness.
Northern Alliance forces arrived the following afternoon, encountering a group of about twenty fighters hiding in the city s park.
This group was killed in a 15-minute gun battle.
After these forces were neutralized, Kabul was in the hands of coalition forces.
The fall of Kabul started a cascading collapse of Taliban positions.
Within 24 hours, all Afghan provinces along the Iranian border had fallen, including Herat.
Local Pashtun commanders and warlords had taken over throughout northeastern Afghanistan, including Jalalabad.
Taliban holdouts in the north, mainly Pakistani volunteers, fell back to the northern city of Kunduz.
By 16 November, the Taliban s last stronghold in northern Afghanistan was under siege.
Nearly 10,000 Taliban fighters, led by foreign fighters, continued to resist.
By then, the Taliban had been forced back to their heartland in southeastern Afghanistan around Kandahar.
By 13 November, al-Qaeda and Taliban forces, possibly including bin Laden, were concentrating in Tora Bora, 50 kilometres  31 mi  southwest of Jalalabad.
Nearly 2,000 al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters fortified themselves in positions within bunkers and caves.
S.
Around the same time, CIA and Special Forces operatives were at work in the area, enlisting local warlords and planning an attack.
S.
On 25 November, as Taliban prisoners were moved into Qala-I-Janghi fortress near Mazar-I-Sharif, a few Taliban attacked their Northern Alliance guards.
This incident triggered a revolt by 600 prisoners , who soon seized the southern half of the medieval fortress , including an armory stocked with small arms and crew-served weapons .
Johnny Micheal Spann , a CIA operative who had been interrogating prisoners, was killed, marking America s first combat death.
The revolt was crushed after seven days of fighting involving a Special Boat Service unit, Army Special Forces , and Northern Alliance forces.
AC-130 gunships and other aircraft provided strafing fire and launched bombs.
154] 86 Taliban survived, and around 50 Northern Alliance soldiers were killed.
The revolt was the final combat in northern Afghanistan.
By the end of November, Kandahar was the Taliban s last stronghold, and was coming under increasing pressure.
Nearly 3,000 tribal fighters, led by Karzai and Gul Agha Sherzai , the governor of Kandahar before the Taliban seized power, pressured Taliban forces from the east and cut off northern supply lines to Kandahar.
The Northern Alliance loomed in the north and northeast.
S.
Marines , ferried in by CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters and C-130s, set up a Forward Operating Base known as Camp Rhino in the desert south of Kandahar on 25 November.
This was the coalition s first base, and enabled other operating bases to form.
S.
Rhino was captured, when 15 Taleban armored vehicles approached the base and were attacked by helicopter gunships, destroying many of them.
Meanwhile, airstrikes continued to pound Taliban positions inside the city, where Mullah Omar remained.
Omar remained defiant although his movement controlled only 4 out of 30 Afghan provinces by the end of November.
He called on his forces to fight to the death.
S.
Omar or any Taliban leaders.
On 7 December, Omar slipped out of Kandahar with a group of loyalists and moved northwest into the mountains of Uruzgan Province , thus reneging on the Taliban s promise to surrender their fighters and their weapons.
He was last reported seen leaving in a convoy of motorcycles.
Other Taliban leaders fled to Pakistan through the remote passes of Paktia and Paktika Provinces .
The border town of Spin Boldak surrendered on the same day, marking the end of Taliban control in Afghanistan.
S.
S.
Al-Qaeda fighters fought on at Tora Bora.
S.
The al-Qaeda forces agreed to a truce ostensibly to give them time to surrender their weapons.
The truce was apparently a ruse to allow bin Laden and others to escape into Pakistan.
On 12 December, fighting resumed, probably initiated by a rear guard buying time for the main force s escape through the White Mountains.
By 17 December, the last cave complex had been taken and its defenders overrun.

January, but no sign of al-Qaeda leadership emerged.
An estimated 200 al-Qaeda fighters were killed during the battle, along with an unknown number of tribal fighters.
No American or British deaths were reported.
In December 2001 the United Nations hosted the Bonn Conference .
The Taliban were excluded.
Four Afghan opposition groups participated.
Observers included representatives of neighbouring and other involved major countries.
The resulting Bonn Agreement created the Afghan Interim Authority that would serve as the  repository of Afghan sovereignty  and outlined the so-called Petersberg Process that would lead towards a new constitution and a new Afghan government.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1378 of 14 November 2001, included  Condemning the Taliban for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism by the al-Qaeda network and other terrorist groups and for providing safe haven to Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda and others associated with them, and in this context supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to replace the Taliban regime .
The United Nations World Food Programme temporarily suspended activities within Afghanistan at the beginning of the bombing attacks but resumed them after the fall of the Taliban.

Outposts were established in eastern provinces to hunt for Taliban and al-Qaeda fugitives.
Al-Qaeda forces began regrouping in the Shahi-Kot mountains of Paktia province southeast of Gardez throughout January and February 2002.
A Taliban fugitive in Paktia province, Mullah Saifur Rehman began reconstituting some of his militia forces.
They totalled over 1,000 by the beginning of March 2002.
The intention of the insurgents was to use the region to launch guerrilla attacks and possibly a major offensive, copying 1980s anti-Soviet fighters.
Coalition sources soon picked up on this buildup.
S.
Afghan forces launched an offensive, dubbed Operation Anaconda.
Mujahideen forces, using small arms , rocket-propelled grenades , and mortars, were entrenched into caves and bunkers in the hillsides largely above 3,000 m  10,000 ft .
They used  hit and run  tactics, opening fire and then retreating to their caves and bunkers to weather the return fire and bombing.

Instead the guerrillas numbered between 1,000–5,000, according to some estimates, later receiving reinforcements .
By 6 March, eight American and seven Afghan soldiers had been killed and reportedly 400 opposing forces had been killed.
S.
162] Several hundred guerrillas escaped to the tribal areas in Waziristan .
Following the battle at Shahi-Kot, al-Qaeda fighters established sanctuaries among tribal protectors in Pakistan, where they regrouped and launched cross-border raids beginning in the summer of 2002.

S.
We firmly believe that any negotiation with the Taliban can only be acceptable, and therefore effective, if all parties to the conflict are involved in the process.
The present form of discussions with the Taliban is flawed, as it excludes anti-Taliban Afghans.
It must be recalled that the Taliban extremists and their Al-Qaeda supporters were defeated by Afghans resisting extremism with minimal human embedded support from the United States and International community.
The present negotiations with the Taliban fail to take into account the risks, sacrifices and legitimate interests of the Afghans who ended the brutal oppression of all Afghans.

319]  I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised,  Karzai replied.
Both leaders agreed that the United States would transfer Afghan prisoners and prisons to the Afghan government   and withdraw troops from Afghan villages in spring 2013.
320]   The international forces, the American forces, will be no longer present in the villages, that it will be the task of the Afghan forces to provide for the Afghan people in security and protection,  the Afghan president said.

After 2013, Afghanistan has been shaken hard with suicide bombings by the Taliban.
A clear example of this is a bombing of a Lebanese restaurant in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of Kabul on 18 February 2014.
Among the dead in this attack was UN staff and the owner of the restaurant, who died protecting his business.
21 people altogether were killed.
Meanwhile, the withdrawal continues with 200 more US troops alone coming home.

Castually estimates for specific years or periods have been published by multiple organizations.
According to a UN report, the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009.
345] A UN report in June 2011 stated that 2,777 civilians were known to have been killed in 2010,  insurgents responsible for 75% .
346] A July 2011 UN report said  1,462 non-combatants died  in the first six months of 2011  insurgents 80% .
347] In 2011 a record 3,021 civilians were killed, the fifth successive annual rise.
348] According to a UN report, in 2013 there were 2,959 civilian deaths with 74% being blamed on anti-government forces, 8% on Afghan security forces, 3% on ISAF forces, 10% to ground engagements between anti-Government forces and pro-Government forces and 5% of the deaths were unattributed.
349] 60% of Afghans have direct personal experience and most others report suffering a range of hardships.
96% have been affected either personally or from the wider consequences.
According to Nicholas Kristoff , improved healthcare resulting from the war has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
2 million others remained refugees in 2013.
Regional security risks and levels of opium poppy cultivation in 2007–2008.
From 1996–1999, the Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan s poppy fields and made opium its largest source of revenue.
Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income.
According to Rashid,  drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war.  In The New York Times , the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they  appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war .
He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money:  poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden .
By 2000 Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world s opium supply and in 2000 produced an estimated 3276 tonnes from 82,171 hectares  203,050 acres .
357] Omar then banned opium cultivation and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from 1,685 hectares  4,160 acres .
358] Some observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations – was issued only to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles.
1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest.
The trafficking of accumulated stocks continued in 2000 and 2001.
In 2002, the UN mentioned the  existence of significant stocks of opiated accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests .
S.
Taliban allegedly authorized Afghan peasants to sow opium again.
Soon after the invasion opium production increased markedly.
359] By 2005, Afghanistan was producing 90% of the world s opium, most of which was processed into heroin and sold in Europe and Russia.
360] In 2009, the BBC reported that  UN findings say an opium market worth $65bn  £39bn  funds global terrorism, caters to 15 million addicts, and kills 100,000 people every year .
2 million in 2001, including fewer than 50,000 girls.

He cited a recent uptick in attacks in Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan.
Petraeus insisted that the challenges in Afghanistan were more complicated than the ones he had faced in Iraq during his tour and required removing widespread sanctuaries and strongholds.
Observers have argued that the mission in Afghanistan is hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on the country instead of the region.
In 2009, Afghanistan moved three places in Transparency International  s annual index of corruption, becoming the world s second most-corrupt country just ahead of Somalia.

Beginning in 2011, insurgent forces in Afghanistan began using a tactic of insider attacks on ISAF and Afghan military forces.
In the attacks, Taliban personnel or sympathizers belonging to, or pretending to belong to, the Afghan military or police forces attack ISAF personnel, often within the security of ISAF military bases and Afghan government facilities.
In 2011, for example, 21 insider attacks killed 35 coalition personnel.
Forty-six insider attacks killed 63 and wounded 85 coalition troops, mostly American, in the first 11 months of 2012.

According to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009.
345] The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission  AIGRC  called the Taliban s terrorism against the Afghan civilian population a war crime.
30] According to Amnesty International, the Taliban commit war crimes by targeting civilians, including killing teachers, abducting aid workers and burning school buildings.
Amnesty International said that up to 756 civilians were killed in 2006 by bombs, mostly on roads or carried by suicide attackers belonging to the Taliban.
446] Some religious leaders have condemned Taliban terrorist attacks and said these kinds of attacks are against Islamic ethics.
NATO has alleged that the Taliban have used civilians as human shields .
As an example, NATO pointed to the victims of NATO air strikes in Farah province in May 2009, during which the Afghan government claims up to 150 civilians were killed.
NATO stated it had evidence the Taliban forced civilians into buildings likely to be targeted by NATO aircraft involved in the battle.
This was a deliberate plan by the Taliban to create a civilian casualty crisis.
These were not human shields; these were human sacrifices.

Unicef, for example, has vaccinated 734,000 children against measles over the last two months, in a country where virtually no one had been vaccinated against the disease in the previous 10 years.
Because measles often led to death in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign will save at least 35,000 children s lives each year.

President Obama bestowed the highest military honor to Afghan war veteran and former Army captain William D.
Swenson Tuesday, recognizing his efforts to save Americans during a battle with Taliban insurgents along the Pakistan border in 2009.
The 34-year-old unemployed Seattle resident received the sky blue ribbon and medal for his service as a trainer and adviser embedded with the Afghan Border Police Mentor Team.

Swenson was first nominated for the Medal of Honor in 2009, but the paperwork was lost and resubmitted in 2011.
The captain s criticism of a lack of help during the battle prompted an investigation that resulted in two Army officers being reprimanded.
He is the second survivor from that battle to receive the prestigious medal, marking just the second time in 50 years for that to happen, according to Obama.

Secretary of State John Kerry flew back into Kabul last week to stop a figurative and literal fist fight.
His shuttle diplomacy has seemingly salvaged the Afghan presidential elections -- the cornerstone of America s effort to introduce democracy in the country.
The presidential elections held in April were to pick a replacement for President Hamid Karzai, a member of Afghanistan s Pashtun ethnic group.
Pashtuns are the majority in Afghanistan.
The Taliban are Pashtuns.
Abdullah Abdullah , a candidate with a Tajik heritage, won the most votes.
His slightly unclear lineage and his decades-long alliance with the ethnic Tajik and Uzbek  Northern Alliance  mean he has not carried the Pashtun vote.
Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, whose heritage is 100 percent Pashtun, came second.
While Abdullah won the most votes, he failed to win a clear majority.
In keeping with the constitution, a runoff election was held .
Ahmadzai won a majority this time; a complete reversal.
But Abdullah s people cried foul , producing evidence they said, that ballot boxes were stuffed and that officials linked to the current administration were complicit in widespread fraud.
Abdullah refused to back down and there was fear of a coup.
With America s long project in democracy in clear jeopardy, Kerry flew to Kabul on July 12 and convinced both sides to agree to a recount of the ballots.
Last week, as the vote recount continued, Abdullah and Ahmadzai supporters got into a fist-fight as they argued over the legitimacy of individual ballots.
The nation s ethnic divisions were on display.
On Friday, after Kerry spent 24 hours cajoling the warring candidates to strike a deal, he was able to stand shoulder to shoulder with both men to announce a breakthrough.

After American forces toppled the Taliban leadership in 2001 and forced its al Qaeda allies underground in Afghanistan, officials in Washington didn t know their war was just beginning.
Several years later, to Western minds, the war was winding down.
In October 2004, President Karzai won the first true election in Afghan history after city dwellers and villagers ignored Taliban threats and lined up in the rain and mountain snow to vote.
But gradually the Taliban, whose leadership had retreated to Pakistan, came back.
The war was then and is today being fought largely in Pashtun areas, where many are still sympathetic to the Taliban.

The last British soldiers have been airlifted out of Camp Bastion, as    Britain’s base in Helmand was closed down.
The “tactical withdrawal” of hundreds of British soldiers came a day after the    end of Britain’s war in Afghanistan and was carried out in    almost complete secrecy, amid serious security concerns.
In a massive operation that took months of planning, the last military    equipment in Camp Bastion and the remaining members of the Armed Forces were    flown out on 17 waves of helicopters and airplanes, as the Afghans took    control of the base.
Chinooks, Hercules planes and US Sea Stallions were used in the massive    airlift to Kandahar, the US-led base in the neighbouring province.
Tornadoes and Apache helicopters flew overhead to provide protection from the    air.
All British troops, apart from special forces and a team working at a    training facility in Kabul, will return home by the end of the year.
Brigadier Robert Thomson, the most senior British officer on the base, said he    was delighted with how the manoeuvre took place.
This is not an evacuation,” he said.
I am standing here without body armour    and we are going at walking pace.
The towers around the 40km perimeter wall were handed over to Afghan security    forces one at a time, shortly after dawn, in a carefully choreographed    operation.
Two full-scale dress rehearsals for “B-day” – pronounced bidet – were carried    out in the last two weeks.
In the final hours before Camp Bastion closed down, British officers were    continuing to monitor militant activity.
In one incident, less than 24 hours before the departure, a rocket-propelled    grenade was fired by militants just eight miles south of the base.
An Afghan policeman was killed while the official ceremony to hand over power    to the Afghans was going on in Camp Bastion.
Major General Seyed Malook, who will run the new camp, said he was sad to see    his friends leave, after working together for years, but glad they were able    to return home.
He said he was “especially grateful to the mothers who sent their sons to    Afghanistan who did not return”.
They have given peace and security to the Afghan people,” he said.
He said that the camp did not so far have a new name, to replace Camp Bastion    and Camp Leatherneck.
We will try our best.
We can have our own name for the base,” he said.
Bastion was originally named after the bomb-proof bags made by a UK company    called Hesco Bastion, which make up vast chunks of its brutal architecture.
Questions have been raised about the lack of a memorial to the 453 British    servicemen and women who died in the conflict.
All the brass plaques commemorating their sacrifice have been removed from a    wall on the base and flown back to the UK to be placed in the National    Arboretum.
Other walls marking British achievements have been painted over in the last    few days.
Camp Bastion has slowly been closed down over the last few months, winding    down one capacity after another, until it became a ghost town over the final    hours.
At its peak three years ago, the camp – along with the American base    Camp Leatherneck and the Afghan base Camp Shorabak - was home to up to    40,000 people.
It was the size of Reading and had a runway which was approximately two miles    long, supporting up to 600 aircraft and helicopter movements a day.
The last aeroplane to leave the base carried four vehicles, including a fire    engine, which was needed in case of disaster on the runway.
The air traffic control was maintained by a team in an aircraft flying above    the base.
The security operation was carefully managed in order to avoid any repeat of    Camp Bastion’s low point in 2012, when 19 Taliban fighters managed to    penetrate the perimeter fence.
Two American servicemen were killed and millions of pounds worth of equipment    was destroyed.
Squadron Leader Dale White, of 15 Squadron RAF Regiment, said he was looking    forward to getting back home.
It is the number of moving pass which has made it complicated, but this is a    steady, deliberate, calm process.
Wing Commander Matt Radnall, of the RAF Regiment, was in charge of force    protection in Camp Bastion.
There is a sense of relief, six months of hard work and it all went    smoothly.
It was the highlight of 24 years in the RAF.
It has worked    perfectly.
The Afghans were right on time.
Senior Aircraftsman John Downing, in the RAF Regiment, 29, from Wolverhampton,    was in the last helicopter out of Camp Bastion.
He said it was an honour to    have been part of the withdrawal.
It s a relief to be getting out of there,  he said.  We ve    done our time.
Britain s war in Afghanistan came to an end today after a 13-year conflict which has cost billions of pounds and hundreds of lives.
In a historic moment in the Afghan desert, Britain lowered its flag in Camp Bastion in an end of operations ceremony signifying the finish of the longest military campaign in modern times.
Those few hundred British troops remaining at the camp will begin to make their way home in the next few days ahead of schedule after handing over to the Afghan forces.
Symbolic: Troops lowering the Union flag today at Camp Bastion, where they marked the end of combat operations in Afghanistan after 13 years.
Last chapter?
The emblem was the last British  flag flying above the skies of Helmand Province.
While some British personnel will remain in the country, today marked the end of combat operations after a bloody campaign which was only meant to last a few years.
Those who are left will be given a new mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan forces – but will not be engaged in fighting.
Security was heightened at the camp as officials warned there was still a threat the Taliban could make one final attack as the troops prepared to leave.
Soldiers rehearsed the ceremony repeatedly – taking into account any hostile action which could arise given the nature of the event and the seniority of those present.
Military chiefs claimed only ‘time will tell’ whether the Afghan National Security Forces will be able to keep Camp Bastion and the Helmand province out of the hands of the Taliban.
But they said the British campaign in the country had given a new ‘sense of hope’ to the Afghan people and made streets in the UK safer from terrorist threats.
Brigadier Rob Thomson, the most senior British officer in Helmand, said of the end of combat operations: ‘I think there are three emotions at play.
We are proud of what our servicemen and women have done.
S.
We are happy and sad.
He said they had made a difference for British streets as well as those in Afghanistan.
Asked if we had won or lost the war, he said that in today’s wars there is not a simple ‘defeat’ or ‘victory’ like there was with the Second World War.
He said: ‘That’s not how struggles end today.
I think we have an army that is hugely adaptable and can adjust in step as we enter a new campaign.
I am kind of optimistic I think what we have achieved is something we can be proud of.
There are still some challenges in Afghanistan.
In a parade attended by around 200 military personnel and civilians, troops paraded a US flag and two flags representing the regional command of Afghanistan.
While they were held high in the sky, the national anthems of Afghanistan and Britain played throughout.
Three of the flags in the centre of the ceremony on poles were then lowered - Nato’s flag was first, followed by the Union Jack and finally the American flag, leaving just the Afghan flag still flying.
Saying goodbye: Much of the once-sprawling base at Camp Bastion has now returned to lengthy strips of desert.
Abandoned: Brigadier Rob Thomson said at the empty base:  I am kind of optimistic I think what we have achieved is something we can be proud of.
An Afghan sermon was followed by a prayer and Brigadier General Yoo, commander of Regional Command South West, who has led the mission in Helmand, relinquished his duties.
He said: ‘Today is significant because it is the end of the beginning.
It is the beginning for the resolution support mission in south west Afghanistan.
It is amazing what you can accomplish when no one cares who gets the credit.
When you think about the cost it has been expensive.
I am taking about the cost of human casualties.
When you think about the cost it has been expensive.
I am taking about the cost of human casualties.
Major General Malook, of the Afghan army, said: ‘I am really happy but I am really sad.
I’m happy because they are going to their homes, I’m sad because they are my friends.
Only the highest level of the ANSF are privy to top secret security plans detailing the day of the final departure of western forces – which will be named B-Day - or, Bastion Day.
The majority of the Afghan forces will only know 12 hours prior to the final date of departure, which will leave not a single British or American person on the soil in Helmand.
Defence secretary Michael Fallon told the BBC s Andrew Marr show that  mistakes  had been made.
I think the generals have been clear that mistakes were made,  he said.
Mistakes were made militarily and mistakes were made by the politicians at the time.
In an official statement, he added:  It is with pride that we announce the end of UK combat operations in Helmand having given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a stable future.
Our Armed Forces  tremendous sacrifice laid the foundations for a strong Afghan Security Force, set the security context that enabled the first democratic transition of power in the country s history, and stopped it being a launch pad for terrorist attacks in the UK.
The former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt added:  We have had to conduct a fully-fledged counter insurgence over the last eight years which has been difficult and expensive in blood and treasure, but we have given them  the Afghans  the chance of a better life.
David Cameron said:  I made a commitment that I would get our Armed Forces out of Afghanistan by 2015 and today sees the end of combat operations in the country.
Thousands of British servicemen fought for eight years in the heat and dust of Helmand to keep it out of the murderous hands of the Taliban.
They were picked off by snipers, blown up by roadside bombs and 453 men and women lost their lives in the ferocious battle to liberate the Afghan province.
Camp Bastion grew to a huge military city in the desert after being built in 2006 and had become a safe haven for troops away from the fighting.
It was the main operating base in the southern province, and was until today the last remaining major UK base in the country.
The symbolic stronghold was handed over to the Afghan forces, trained by US and UK military personnel, who will now take the lead for security throughout the country.
UK troops will shortly relocate to Kandahar air base as the UK mission comes to an end almost two months ahead of schedule.
Having relocated to Kandahar, the British forces will spend the next few weeks shipping the remaining equipment back to the UK before flying home.
But while logistics units, medics and infantry soldiers will head to the huge air base, it is understood a number of special forces will remain in Kabul.
The UK will leave around 500 troops in Kabul where they will train Afghan Army officers in a mission codenamed Operation Toral, and known as ‘Sandhurst in the Sand’.
Their new mission will be to train, advise and assist the Afghan forces as they continue to fight insurgents in the war-torn country.
Brigadier Darrell Amison, Commander of Joint Force Support, Afghanistan said: ‘From a military perspective there has been a huge amount of commitment and sacrifice here.
We have been here a long time, the UK is a safer place and broadly we have achieved our objectives.
To be here in the final stages it gives me immense professional pride.
The soldiers feel part of something quite special here.
We have developed remarkably in the last eight years.
The soldier in 2006 is a very different one to 2014.
We don’t know where this country is going to go and I would not like to take a guess.
There is hope for the country, whether that is seized is another matter.
The remaining troops remained optimistic yesterday, saying they had fulfilled the mission they set out to achieve.
Corporal Thomas Warner, 23, of the 1st Queen’s Dragoon Guards, said: ‘It is a historic event and I’m massively proud.
The Afghan forces are fantastic and I’m very confident in what they are doing, they’ve got the best possible chance.
It is strange thinking I will never come back.
Regimental sergeant major Robert Mansel, of the 1st Queen’s Dragoon Guards, said: ‘It is a bit of a strange feeling being some of the last here.
I am privileged to be chosen and feel a sense of achievement.
The initial plan for Afghanistan was to deliver stability and development and leave within a few years.
But Taliban forces proved to be much stronger than first anticipated by military chiefs and the UK was dragged into a long and costly conflict.
Will Davies, lieutenant colonel of the 1st The Queen’s Dragoon Guards, The Welsh Cavalry, one of the last remaining units at the camp, said after today s ceremony: ‘The inside threat is there.
It is always going to be there.
Analysts last year estimated Britain had by then spent at least £37billion on the campaign, and it predicted that would rise by £40billion by the end of the decade.
The Taliban – originally a group of Islamic scholars – were in control of about 90 per cent of Afghanistan until late 2001.
They were at loggerheads with the international community over the presence on their soil of Osama Bin Laden after the ordered the attacks in the US on 11 September 2001.
Prime Minister Tony Blair had delivered a stark ultimatum to the Taliban to hand him over or face ‘very considerable damage’.
After their refusal to hand him over, the US initiated aerial attacks a month later, paving the way for opposition groups to drive them from power and heralding a long-term, Nato-led military presence.
As the British and American forces diverted their attention to Iraq in 2003, the Taliban began to make advances across the country.
As a result, in 2006, Britain committed reinforcements in a bid to install a viable democracy, modernise the country and destroy the opium industry.
At the height of the war, 9,500 British military personnel were serving in Afghanistan.
In September 2013, David Cameron boldly declared that Britain’s mission would be ‘accomplished’ in Afghanistan by the time the troops pulled out this month.
Appearing to dismiss fears that militants would return to wreak havoc, the Prime Minister gave a startlingly upbeat assessment of the troubled country’s prospects.
He insisted that the main aim of the mission was to give the country a ‘basic level of security’ against terrorism, and he was confident this had been achieved.
2million students were enrolled in schools, with fewer than 50,000 of them girls.
7million children attending school, including three million girls.
Brigadier Rob Thomson, the most senior officer left in Helmand, blasted  erroneous  comparisons between Iraq - where Isis militants have swept in and seized vast areas - and what may happen in Afghanistan.
Iraq and Afghanistan are very different in terms of the environment here, whether that is the geography, the culture, their societal structures and so on,  he said.
The way we are ending the mission is very different.
We are transitioning now for the next two years.
There will be continued support in the ministry of defence and the ministry of interior to people, there will be train, assist and advise missions through parts of the country.
It is not a cliff edge end here.
It is going to be a transition and I think that is really important.
Around seven million Afghans voted to choose a successor to Hamid Karzai in the first round of this year’s presidential election campaign.
Western officials insist the Afghan security forces – who have been trained by US and UK personnel - have managed to contain the Taliban’s offensives on their own.
But the Taliban have been launching attacks ahead of the withdrawal of most foreign forces by the end of this year.
The Afghan National Army and police force now number almost 330,000, but much of their focus is on Kabul and the government has struggled to extend its unity beyond the capital.
The insurgents’ alarming gains in the south and east raise the nightmare prospect of the Taliban taking over swathes of land and assaulting the rest of the country.
In the northern province of Kunduz, there are now two districts almost entirely under Taliban rule, local officials have said.
The Taliban are administering legal cases and schools, and even allowing international aid operations to work there, it was claimed in the New York Times.
Similarly in the Tangi Valley in the Wardak province, just an hour’s drive from Kabul, the Taliban are said to be in control of the everyday life of much of the population.
A BBC Panorama investigation found they are using the valley as a staging post for attacks on the capital as it tries to seize back the whole country.
The number of Afghan civilians killed or injured in the conflict in the first six months of this year rose by a quarter from 2013 levels to nearly 5,000 people.
The UN said three quarters of the deaths and injuries were caused by insurgent fighters.
In the last eight months, 272 members of the Afghan National Army and 506 members of the police were killed in the Helmand province alone.
But British military officials yesterday said the government of Afghanistan holds the district centres and holds the routes in between which was the most important factor.
Following claims the Taliban were ‘days away’ from recapturing three Helmand towns in September, Tory MP John Baron warned the area would eventually be effectively ‘handed back’ to the Taliban.
But officials in Afghanistan and British chiefs say they are firmly in control.
Under new agreements that Afghanistan signed with the US and Nato, about 12,000 foreign troops will remain in the country beyond 2014 to train and assist Afghan forces.
Kate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament  CND , said:  When the UK went to war in Afghanistan in 2001, few could have imagined that this bloody conflict would last twice as long as the Second World War.
Operation Enduring Freedom has certainly endured, though it is not liberty which shall be its legacy.
Rather, what will remain is a fractured state mourning tens of thousands of civilians killed in an aimless conflict.
David Cameron has claimed that the mission in Afghanistan has been accomplished, but which mission is that?
Our supposed goals shifted like a weathervane.
Was our aim the pursuit of those responsible for September 11, in order to bring them to justice?
That happened a decade after the invasion, if summary execution can be described as justice, and it didn t even take place in Afghanistan.
Was our mission regime change?
Despite rigged elections and staunch support for the US-installed President Karzai, relations with his government have all but collapsed.
Meanwhile the Taliban remains in the ascendancy, increasing the rate and the audacity of its attacks, and utilising the mobilising power of a Western imperialist invasion.
Was our mission controlling the opium trade?
Opium production in Afghanistan is higher than it has ever been, now providing around 90% of the world s supply.
Lindsey German, convenor of the Stop The War Coalition, added:  The departure of the troops from Afghanistan is welcome, but many questions are unanswered.
Why has £20billion been spent on this conflict while austerity means cuts at home?
Why has ten times as much been spent on the military in Afghanistan as has been spent on aid?
Why have many thousands died?
How many advisers and military support will be left in Afghanistan following the withdrawal?
What was the point of this war which has gone on longer than the First and Second World Wars combined?
S.
Peace accords are signed in 1988 and the final Red Army troops leave Afghanistan the following year, but civil war continues as the various mujahideen groups turn on each other.
Taliban seize control of Kabul and introduce a hard-line version of Islam, which bans women from work and stones  criminals  to death.
Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden welcomed to the country.
United Nations imposes an air embargo and sanctions in a bid to force Afghanistan to hand over Bin Laden, who is suspected of orchestrating the bombing of African embassies the previous year.
Ahmad Shah Masood, the leader of the main opposition group to the Taliban, is assassinated.

Then-prime minister Tony Blair confirms that British forces are involved in US-led military action, dubbed Operation Enduring Freedom, against al Qaida training camps and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where Bin Laden is hiding.
A loose coalition of forces known as the Northern Alliance takes control of Kabul from the Taliban.
Other cities swiftly fall and Hamid Karzai is sworn in as head of an interim government before Christmas.
Bin Laden escapes to a cave complex and later crosses the border to Pakistan.
The pace of the war begins to slow as the first foreign peacekeepers are deployed in Afghanistan, marking the beginning of a long and bloody battle against Taliban insurgents.
President Bush announces a substantial plan to  rebuild  Afghanistan, but it has critics from the start as unrest continues to grow.

Hamid Karzai wins the Presidency in the country s first direct democratic election.
Weeks later Bin Laden releases a taped series of taunts to the West.
Even as Afghanistan holds Parliamentary elections the Taliban begins a fierce resurgence, using increased numbers of suicide bombers and  improvised explosive devices   IEDs  to strike fear into the hearts of millions.
In the years that follow more than 100 will be killed in  green-on-blue  attacks by Taliban insiders who infiltrate Afghan forces before turning on their Western allies.
Camp Bastion airfield is built in the desert near Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, by 39 Regiment Royal Engineers and several private contractors.

68,000 to 98,000 by the summer of 2010.
A massive increase in the number of killings leads to Lance Corporal Adam Drane being named the 100th British death in Afghanistan in 2009 alone.
Parliamentary elections are also disrupted by allegations of fraud and Taliban violence.
Over the summer, a newly-elected David Cameron had visited British troops in Helmand province and told them theirs was  not a war of choice, it is a war of necessity.

By this point the British death toll has topped 400.

A total of 453 British forces personnel or Ministry of Defence civilians have died while serving in Afghanistan since the start of operations in October 2001.
According to the MoD, of these, 404 were killed as a result of hostile action while 49 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents, or have not yet officially been assigned a cause of death pending the outcome of an investigation.

Soviet Special Operations Forces Prepare for Mission in Afghanistan.

Many would argue that the story of how 9 11 came about goes back, at least, to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, with which it shares a border.
Afghanistan had experienced several coups since 1973, when the Afghan monarchy was overthrown by Daud Khan, who was sympathetic to Soviet overtures.
Subsequent coups reflected struggles within Afghanistan among factions with different ideas about how Afghanistan should be governed and whether it should be communist, and with degrees warmth toward the Soviet Union.
The Soviets intervened following the overthrow of a pro-communist leader.
In late December 1979, after several months of evident military preparation, they invaded Afganistan.
At that time, the Soviet Union and the United States were engaged in the Cold War, a global competition for the fealty of other nations.
The United States was, thus, deeply interested in whether the Soviet Union would succeed in establishing a communist government loyal to Moscow in Afghanistan.
In order to forestall that possibility, the United States began funding insurgent forces to oppose the Soviets.

The war in Afghanistan continues taking and destroying lives, both due to the direct consequences of violence and the war-induced breakdown of public health, security, and infrastructure.
The war has also inflicted invisible wounds.
In 2009, the Afghan Ministry of Public Health said fully two-thirds of Afghans suffer mental health problems.
Afghanistan was poor and vulnerable before the war that began in 2001; its population remains poor and vulnerable.
The general immiseration of the Afghan population is in part due to and exacerbated by past conflict.
The prior wars and civil conflict in the country have made Afghan society extremely vulnerable to the indirect effects of the current war.
While Afghanistan has benefited from investments in health care that may ameliorate some of the effects of war, claims of significant strides in health and healthcare have been called into question.

Gallup first asked Americans about the Vietnam War in late August early September 1965, with 24% saying military involvement there was a mistake.
S.
47% viewed involvement there as a mistake, compared with 44% who did not.
And it took just a year and three months from the March 2003 start of the Iraq war for a plurality of Americans to first say involvement there was a mistake, although opinions about that war fluctuated until late 2005, after which they were more consistently negative.
Republicans and independents who lean Republican are significantly less likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say the war in Afghanistan was a mistake.
S.
Afghanistan began under a Republican president, George W.
Bush, but it has continued under Barack Obama, a Democratic president.
Therefore, Republicans  higher levels of support may be related to a Republican president s initiation of the war, or an ideological inclination to support military involvement.
S.
2001, with well over 35,000 troops still there.
Americans were initially more supportive of involvement in Afghanistan than they were for any recent major military intervention.
S.
Afghanistan for a longer period of time than was the case for other wars.
But Americans  waning patience with the conflict has finally reached the point at which Americans are as likely to say the war was a mistake as to say it was not.
The Obama administration plans to draw down the number of troops in Afghanistan significantly by the end of this year.
Once that happens, and the war essentially ends, Americans  assessments of whether intervention was a mistake will largely depend on the political course Afghanistan takes, including whether terrorist cells are able to regroup there.
Gallup research conducted in Afghanistan shows that Afghans rate their lives as poorly on several dimensions as residents of any country in the world.

District of Columbia.
For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking.
Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50% cellphone respondents and 50% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region.
Landline telephone and cellphone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.
Landline respondents are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member had the most recent birthday.
Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability, nonresponse, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the two sampling frames.
They are also weighted to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density, and phone status  cellphone only landline only both, cellphone mostly, and having an unlisted landline number .

Taliban-controlled Afghanistan with an intense bombing campaign by American and British forces.
Logistical support was provided by other nations including France, Germany, Australia and Canada and, later, troops were provided by the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance rebels.

Afghanistan was intended to target terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden  s al-Qaida organization, which was based in the country, as well as the extreme fundamentalist Taliban government that had ruled most of the country since 1996 and supported and protected al-Qaida.
The Taliban, which had imposed its extremist version of Islam on the entire country, also perpetrated countless human rights abuses against its people, especially women, girls and ethnic Hazaras.
During their rule, large numbers of Afghans lived in utter poverty, and as many as 4 million Afghans are thought to have suffered from starvation.
N.
Security Council had demanded that the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden for prosecution.
After deeming the Taliban s counteroffers unsatisfactory—among them to try bin Laden in an Islamic court—the invasion began with an aerial bombardment of Taliban and al-Qaida installations in Kabul, Kandahar, Jalalabad, Konduz and Mazar-e-Sharif.
Other coalition planes flew in airdrops of humanitarian supplies for Afghan civilians.
The Taliban called the actions  an attack on Islam.  In a taped statement released to the Arabic al-Jazeera television network, Osama bin Laden called for a war against the entire non-Muslim world.
S.
On November 12, a little over a month after the military action began, Taliban officials and their forces retreated from the capital of Kabul.
By early December, Kandahar, the last Taliban stronghold, had fallen and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar went into hiding rather than surrender.
S.
Special Forces troops.
Al-Qaida soon initiated a truce, which is now believed to have been a ploy to allow Osama bin Laden and other key al-Qaida members time to escape into neighboring Pakistan.
By mid-December, the bunker and cave complex used by al-Qaida at Tora Bora had been captured, but there was no sign of bin Laden.
After Tora Bora, a grand council of Afghan tribal leaders and former exiles was convened under the leadership of Hamid Karzai, who first served as interim leader before becoming the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan on December 7, 2004.
S.
Qaida and Taliban forces began to regroup in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Afghan troops in guerilla-style warfare and have also been responsible for the deaths of elected government officials and aid workers and the kidnapping of foreigners.
Hundreds of American and coalition soldiers and thousands of Afghans have been killed and wounded in the fighting.
Afghans continue to make up the largest refugee population in the world, though nearly 3 million have returned to Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, further straining the country s war-ravaged economy.

Afghanistan War, 1978–92, conflict between anti-Communist Muslim Afghan guerrillas  mujahidin  and Afghan government and Soviet forces.
The conflict had its origins in the 1978 coup that overthrew Afghan president Sardar Muhammad Daud Khan, who had come to power by ousting the king in 1973.
The president was assassinated and a pro-Soviet Communist government under Noor Mohammed Taraki was established.
1979  by Soviet forces and the installation of Babrak Karmal as president.
The Soviet invasion, which sparked Afghan resistance, intially involved an estimated 30,000 troops, a force that ultimately grew to 100,000.
The mujahidin were supported by aid from the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia, channeled through Pakistan, and from Iran.
Although the USSR had superior weapons and complete air control, the rebels successfully eluded them.
The conflict largely settled into a stalemate, with Soviet and government forces controlling the urban areas, and the Afghan guerrillas operating fairly freely in mountainous rural regions.
S.
USSR.
In 1986, Karmal resigned and Mohammad Najibullah became head of a collective leadership.
1988, President Mikhail Gorbachev announced the withdrawal of USSR troops, which was completed one year later.
Soviet citizens had become increasingly discontented with the war, which dragged on without success but with continuing casualties.
In the spring of 1992, Najibullah s government collapsed and, after 14 years of rule by the People s Democratic party, Kabul fell to a coalition of mujahidin under the military leadership of Ahmed Shah Massoud.
The war left Afghanistan with severe political, economic, and ecological problems.
More than 1 million Afghans died in the war and 5 million became refugees in neighboring countries.
In addition, 15,000 Soviet soldiers were killed and 37,000 wounded.
Economic production was drastically curtailed, and much of the land laid waste.
At the end of the war more than 5 million mines saturated approximately 2% of the country, where they will pose a threat to human and animal life well into the 21st cent.
The disparate guerrilla forces that had triumphed proved unable to unite, and Afghanistan became divided into spheres of control.
These political divisions set the stage for the rise of the Taliban later in the decade.

Gardez - Gardez Gardez or Gardeyz, city  1979 pop.
Iranian photographer Majid Saeedi has won the 2014 FotoEvidence Book Award for his project Life in War.
Though Saeedi has spent his professional life photographing different conflict zones.
This project focused exclusively on the people whose lives have been crushed by the war in Afghanistan over a10-year period.
Svetlana Bachevanova, publisher of FotoEvidence, announced the release of Life in War, saying: “Majid’s work is in the best tradition of humanistic photography.
Speaking the language, he was able to embed with the people.
His images show us the humanity of people who have endured decades of war.
His photographs speak in the language of the Afghan street.
Saeedi has photographed throughout the Middle East for the past two decades, focusing on humanitarian issues, with a special interest in telling previously untold stories of social injustice.
He also especially enjoys doing street photography – portraying citizens and ordinary life.
Life in War is probably the only book about Afghanistan that isn’t just filled with images of conflict.
Saeedi photographed daily life in the context of war.
Speaking the language, Majid embedded with the Afghan people rather than with an alien army.
His photographs reveal the humanity of a people living through decades of fighting.
Afghanistan has been dealing with war for 50 years,” says Saeedi.
Sometimes with countries attacking it and at others with civil wars.
War affects the ordinary life of survivors, children lose their parents, women whose husbands die and they are forced to manage their life and children as a single mother.
For the past 40 years, Afghanistan has been involved in various wars and conflict.
Remnants of Russian tanks are still present in the streets, mountainsides and valleys.
After the war with the Soviet Union, communists seized power in the country.
It was during this time that conservative Muslims started to get organised, and eventually gained power themselves.
Later, they in turn became another cause of strife, this time in the civil war between al-Qaida and the country’s regular civilians.
Saeedi said he was tempted to photograph war on the front line, but instead remained with the people.
War is not the only thing going on in Afghanistan,” says Saeedi.
There is the influence of Persian and Mughal culture in traditional Afghan architecture and decorative garments.
This specific concert was only for females; under Taliban rule listening to the music even from CD or cassette was forbidden.
The title of the concert is ‘Peace’.
Zahra is 20 years old from Herat.
Afghan women are in a subordinate position in society, where conservative Islamic laws and traditions dictate what a woman is allowed to do in a male-dominated world.
Forced marriages, domestic violence, poverty and lack of access to education are said to be some of the main reasons for self-immolation.
As Ed Kashi notes in the book’s introduction: “By achieving the intimacy of the insider, especially as a male, he has found moments with women that are difficult to be privy to, let alone photograph.
Eighty women participate in every workshop despite rising tensions between an increasing Taliban presence in the city and the extensive Nato presence.
Despite the poverty, drug addiction, lack of education, life goes on in Afghanistan and people continue to live with hope for a better tomorrow.
Afghanistan is an unknown country with high mountains and people with culture.
Afghans are trying their best to start each day without war and bloodshed but this is not possible unless all nations are united, power is divided between them and all of them are educated,” says Saeedi.
Our editors  picks for the day s top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.
Up Close: This is part of an occasional series offering a fresh perspective, in words and photographs, on the people and places shaping today’s world.
Shamsullah, 10, waits for dressings on his wounds to be changed.
His legs were amputated after he stepped on an improvised explosive device  IED  while walking to school in Helmand province’s Sangin district three months ago.
No one knows how many there actually are.
Decades of conflict have made tallying Afghanistan’s war-related amputees — the victims of land mines, unexploded ordnance and roadside bombs — essentially impossible, health officials say.
But as the battle between Afghan security forces and Taliban fighters rages, humanitarian workers also say potent improvised explosive devices laid by insurgents are contributing to a significant rise in traumatic limb amputations for Afghan civilians and combatants.
And even as the population of Afghans who are missing limbs grows, amputees face discrimination and the harsh stigma of being disabled.
Their families, too, often cannot cope with the strain of caring for severely disabled relatives in a country crushed by poverty and high rates of illiteracy.
Afghan policeman Matiullah, 26, watches Fathi Momand, 50, walk during Matiullah’s first physical therapy session, two days after his legs were amputated.
Shah Zada, 25, allows therapist Sardar Wali to exercise the remains of his amputated legs.
Shah Zada, an Afghan soldier, was injured by an IED.
Socially and financially, their lives are destroyed,” Emanuele Nannini, program director at the Italian nonprofit Emergency, which operates health-care centers across Afghanistan, said of Afghan amputees.
From January to June this year, Emergency’s Center for War Trauma Victims in Lashkar Gah , the capital of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, performed 69 amputations.
The fiercest fighting between the two sides usually takes place in the warmer summer months.
Emergency then sends the amputees to the nearby International Committee for the Red Cross orthopedic facility for long-term rehabilitation.
The patients receive vocational training and other support to reintegrate them into society.
The ICRC said that between April and June this year, it admitted 351 amputee patients to its facilities across Afghanistan.
Doctors amputate the legs of Afghan policeman Matiullah, 26, at Emergency Surgical Center for Civilian War Victims in Lashkar Gah.
Matiullah stepped on an improvised explosive device, which blew off part of his left leg and shredded the right leg.
But for the most part, amputees “are completely dependent on their families, and they become a huge burden,” said Nannini, who is based in Kabul.
The real tragedy starts when they go home.
Indeed, the hardship that comes with the loss of a limb — or limbs — in a country that relies so heavily on agriculture and manual labor is particularly acute.
Farmers can no longer toil.
A mechanic without an arm loses his ability to tinker.
A policeman cannot go out on patrol.
When limbs are torn apart, livelihoods are mangled with them.
Daad Mahmad, left, 30, arrives at the Emergency Surgical Center for Civilian War Victims in Lashkar Gah.
Mohammad Dawoud is a 22-year-old farmer from a village in southern Afghanistan’s Helmand province — and his father’s only son.
He was walking past a police checkpoint on the dirt road near his home this summer when he stepped on a buried IED, he said.
Doctors at Emergency’s hospital in Lashkar Gah amputated both of his legs above the knees.
His fiancee knows what happened to him, but he has not yet heard from her, he said.
Dawoud knows it is unlikely she will marry him now that he is handicapped.
Life will pass somehow,” Dawoud said from his hospital bed in Lashkar Gah.
I used to grow pomegranates,” he said, recalling his life as a farmer.

Since then, they’ve continued to grow in size and in strength, while making huge sacrifices for their country.

Afghanistan, together with our NATO allies and other partners.
That number will almost be cut in half by the end of 2015, and our remaining troops will be consolidated in Kabul and on Bagram Airfield.
S.
Afghanistan will draw down to a normal embassy presence in Kabul, along with a security assistance component, as we ve done in Iraq.
I think Americans have learned that it’s harder to end wars than it is to begin them.
Yet this is how wars end in the 21st century -- not through signing ceremonies, but through decisive blows against our adversaries, transitions to elected governments, security forces who take the lead and ultimately full responsibility.
We remain committed to a sovereign, secure, stable, and unified Afghanistan.
And toward that end, we will continue to support Afghan-led efforts to promote peace in their country through reconciliation.
We have to recognize that Afghanistan will not be a perfect place, and it is not America’s responsibility to make it one.
The future of Afghanistan must be decided by Afghans.
But what the United States can do -- what we will do -- is secure our interests and help give the Afghans a chance, an opportunity to seek a long, overdue and hard-earned peace.

Why should it, when Taliban forces are in position to make battlefield gains?
Foreign troops are headed for the exits, and Afghan security forces–despite improvements in capacity–remain a major work in progress .
The Taliban, though weakened by coalition forces’ firepower, remains a potent enemy, as evidenced by offensives launched in recent months .
The sanctuaries that the Taliban and its Haqqani network allies enjoyed in Pakistan remain intact, even after a recent Pakistani countermilitancy operation in North Waziristan,  which appears to have targeted other militant groups .
As for the bilateral security agreement signed Sept.
S.
Afghanistan next year.
That’s a huge psychological boost for Afghans, as it ensures continuous flows of much-needed training for Afghan forces and of overall civilian and military aid.
But a modest residual troop presence–especially one with a non-combat mandate–won’t produce large-scale stabilization.
The drawdown could also dangerously ratchet up tensions between South Asian countries that don’t get along.
In recent weeks, Afghan accusations of Pakistani complicity in some attacks have reached a crescendo .
Last weekend, the Afghan government issued an ominous invitation to the Taliban: With foreign troops leaving, insurgents should end their war on the Afghan state and unite with Kabul against more serious “external”  read: Pakistani  threats.
And India-Pakistan relations could plunge into crisis.
Pakistani anti-India militants fighting in Afghanistan–including Lashkar-e-Taiba–could respond to the departure of foreign troops by redirecting their attention, and attacks, to India.
New Delhi’s new nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, would not sit nearly as quietly as his predecessor if a terror attack linked to Pakistan were perpetrated in India.
Meanwhile, despite their chilly ties, Kabul and Islamabad do engage in high-level diplomacy, including military-to-military talks .
And tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad are less likely to escalate into conflict than in decades past, when the two countries fought three wars, because both countries now have nuclear weapons.

President Barack Obama made a surprise visit to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan over Memorial Day weekend to thank the American troops stationed there.
In an announcement from the White House Rose Garden on May 27, Obama affirmed his plan to formally conclude the combat mission in Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
That would fulfill the campaign pledge that Obama made on the trail during his 2012 re-election campaign.
It doesn t mean, however, that the United States will be pulling out of the country completely.
There are currently 32,000 troops in Afghanistan; military commanders recommend leaving 10,000 troops after the end of combat operations.
Obama laid out a timeline for withdrawing troops over the next two years.
By the beginning of 2015, about 9,800 troops would be stationed around Afghanistan.
That number will reduce by half over the following year, and by the end of 2016, the military will serve as a normal embassy presence in Kabul, similar to what is now in Iraq.
Obama.
There s a hurdle to cross, though: This withdrawal schedule will only occur if Obama and Afghanistan s new president -- to be elected in two weeks -- sign a bilateral agreement allowing for transition process.
Obama visited Afghanistan in 2012, when he was unsuccessful in reaching a strategic partnership agreement with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
Obama is now hoping he can work with a new president following the election on June 14.
The two final candidates, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, have both indicated they would promptly sign the agreement after taking office.
S.
Afghan security forces.
On May 28, Obama delivered the commencement address at West Point military academy where he placed his plans for Afghanistan in the context of broader foreign policy.
Sustaining the progress made in Afghanistan depends on the ability of Afghans to independently defend themselves, said Obama.
Obama also called on Congress to support a new Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund of up to $5 billion.
The fund will pay for efforts to train and equip more partner countries in North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia so they can also defend themselves against terrorism.
Overall, Obama has said he intends to keep his promise to end the war in Afghanistan in 2014.
But the final outcome is contingent on the signing of a new security agreement.
We re waiting to see the results of Obama s plans before we issue a final rating, so we leave this promise at In the Works.
S.
Secretary of State John Kerry visited Afghanistan recently.
S.
But much remains to be worked out.
The United States and Afghanistan intend to reach an agreement on how many troops would remain, to train the Afghan military and for counterterrorism.
Meanwhile, the people of Afghanistan go to the polls in April 2014 to elect a new president.
I believe that the security of Afghanistan is growing and will grow over the course of the next two years, and I have confidence that in the bilateral security agreement we will have a full understanding of exactly how that will occur,” Kerry said.
S.
New York Times.
Obama has said some troops will remain in 2015 and afterwards, but he hasn t set a number.
In his Feb.
12 State of the Union address , Obama said he intended to bring 34,000 troops back home over the next year.
While it is too soon to make decisions about the number of forces that could remain in Afghanistan after 2014, any presence would be at the invitation of the Afghan Government and focused on two distinct missions: training, advising and equipping Afghan forces, and continued counter-terrorism missions against al Qaeda and their affiliates,” Obama said.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also emphasized the 2014 deadline in conversations with troops on March 8 in a visit to Afghanistan.
We are still at war, and many of you will continue to experience the ugly reality of combat and the heat of battle,” Hagel said .
Obama and his administration are warning that the next two years are difficult.
But as far as messaging, they re clearly emphasizing the 2014 deadline.
We rate this promise In the Works.
Facebook , Twitter and  Google+ .
We re especially interested in any chain emails or social media memes that you would like us to check out.

The US-led war in Afghanistan was a response to the September 11 terrorist attacks on America.
Coalition forces toppled the ruling Taliban in 2001, but stabilising the country is proving more challenging.
Photo: An RAF crewman mans the machine gun mounted on the tailgate of his Chinook as it crosses the Afghan countryside in the morning mist, April 2002.
On 11 September 2001 terrorists hijacked four aeroplanes in the United States.
Two were deliberately flown into each of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York, with another hitting the Pentagon in Virginia.
The fourth aeroplane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania.
The total loss of life on 9 11 was nearly 3,000.
The 19 hijackers were members of al-Qaeda, the global Islamist network founded and led by Saudi-born Osama Bin Laden, now living in Afghanistan.
The Taliban, the ruling power in Afghanistan, were accused by the US of protecting Bin Laden.
Taliban requests for negotiations with the US were rejected in favour of military action, and on 7 October 2001 the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom began in Afghanistan.
The aim of Operation Enduring Freedom was to find Osama Bin Laden, remove the Taliban from power, and prevent the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist haven.
The US was supported by a broad coalition of international forces including the Afghan Northern Alliance, United Kingdom and Canada.
Kabul fell to coalition forces on 13 October 2001.
In early December fierce fighting took place near the Tora Bora caves, where Taliban leader Mullah Omar and Osama Bin Laden were believed to be.
Both men evaded capture and went into hiding.
Kandahar, the last major Taliban stronghold, fell on 7 December 2001, marking the end of the Taliban s rule in Afghanistan.
They were excluded from the Bonn Agreement that formed a draft constitution for Afghanistan, and in 2004 Hamid Karzai was elected the country s president.
Beaten but unbowed, in 2002 the Taliban began a lengthy period of insurgency in an attempt to re-establish their power base.
Meanwhile, international attention turned to Iraq, which US-led coalition forces invaded in 2003.
Control of operations switched to Nato s International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  in 2006.
However, US troop numbers continued to grow throughout the decade in an attempt to contain the Taliban.
The Taliban insurgency involved increasing use of roadside bombs and suicide attacks.
The numbers of Nato troops in Afghanistan grew, but this brought little success.
UN s Tom Koenigs told the German newspaper Der Spiegel in 2006.
Although there had initially been broad public support for the war in Afghanistan in the US and UK, polls suggested a falling in confidence as costs spiralled and casualty numbers rose.
What had started as an operation to remove the Taliban and al-Qaeda had become an expensive damage limitation and state-building exercise.
On 20 November 2010, Nato announced the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan by 2014.
The plan, signed by Hamid Karzai and the UN s secretary general Ban Ki-moon, would see control handed to the new Afghan army  ANA  and police force.
In June 2011 US President Barack Obama announced that 10,000 US troops would leave Afghanistan by the end of the year, and an additional 23,000 would leave by 2012.
Canada withdrew all its troops in 2011, and other Nato countries pledged to reduce their military presence.
In the UK, prime minster David Cameron pledged to end British combat operations in Afghanistan by 2015.
In a covert operation, US Navy SEALs  a special operations force  and CIA operatives killed Osama Bin Laden on 2 May 2011, in his residential compound in Abottabad, Pakistan.
Al-Qaeda swore to avenge Bin Laden s death .

Tuesday this week commemorates 13 years since the start of the Afghan War â€” America s longest running campaign of its kind â€” yet an end to the operation is hardly on the horizon.
Under the terms of the Bilateral Security Agreement, the pact signed last week by representatives for both   the United States and Afghanistan, the US will significantly   reduce the number of soldiers involved in its post-9 11 Operation   Enduring Freedom at the end of this year.
Troop numbers will   shrink to 10,000, signaling indeed a major step towards ending   the war in Afghanistan â€” a campaign promise made by US President   Barack Obama during the lead-up to his re-election in 2012.
With   this week s anniversary, however, the costs incurred already   appear more evident than ever, and the length of the operation   may be endless.
Combined with the only recently concluded war in Iraq, the   financial toll of the Afghan war on Uncle Sam s pocketbook could   range in $4 trillion to $6 trillion, according to research published last year out of Harvard   University.
Additionally, the iCasualties website claims the US military has suffered 2,349 deaths during   Operation Enduring Freedom â€” including 48 this year, or as many   lives lost in that war in 2003 when it was still relatively new.
Of that tally, Breitbart News recently reported, 1,649 deaths or   about 75 percent , have occurred since the start   Pres.
Obama s first term in early 2009.
Even with last week s agreement, however, the Afghan War will   only end in name, if at all.
Under the terms of the pact, the   roughly 9,800 US troops that will remain in Afghanistan past the   end of this year will be cut in half by the end of the next, with   a full-scale withdrawal tentatively slated for the end of 2016.
Once the last of the US forces leave, the Afghan army will again   be tasked with preserving national security, and for the first   time without American troops since 2001.
When those troops actually will exit Afghan for good, however,   remains up in the air.
Under the terms of the BSA, US and NATO   troops have already been cleared to stay â€œ until the end of 2024 and beyond ,â€� suggesting   Operation Enduring Freedom could extend for another decade even   after already being America s longest running war.
This military action is a part of our campaign against   terrorism, another front in a war that has already been joined   through diplomacy, intelligence, the freezing of financial assets   and the arrests of known terrorists by law enforcement agents in   38 countries,â€� Bush said from the White House.
That patience is still at play today, however, and has led   Operation Enduring Freedom into the record books of being the   longest-running US war ever.
Now despite campaign promises made   by Obama, even Bush s successor might not see the end of a war in   Afghanistan anytime soon: 13 years after Bush announced the start   of a military operation against terrorists, the US and its allies   are now in the midst of conducting aerial campaign against the   so-called Islamic State, a terrorist organization that even   Al-Qaeda has distanced itself from over concerns involving the   group s violent practices.
According to new research published   last month by USA Today, Washington is investing roughly   $10 million a day on fighting a campaign against that group.
7 billion spent during the last   fiscal year on Operation Enduring Freedom, but costly   nonetheless.
Washington  CNN  – Support for the war in Afghanistan has dipped below 20%, according to a new national poll, making the country s longest military conflict arguably its most unpopular one as well.

Just 17% of those questioned say they support the 12-year-long war, down from 52% in December 2008.

Personal Liberty; who s left?
America s long war in Afghanistan isn t likely to end well, and the American people seem to know it.
S.
Meanwhile, relations between the United States and the Karzai government are going from bad to worse.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai is not only refusing to sign a security agreement that would allow the United States to leave a residual force in country, he is also making increasingly strident accusations that the United States is to blame for recent civilian deaths.
This depressing outcome is not what most Americans expected following the rapid toppling of the Taliban back in 2001.
It is therefore important that we draw the right lessons from the experience, if only to partly redeem the sacrifices made by the soldiers who fought there.
In that spirit, here is a list of the top 10 mistakes made in America s Afghan War.
1.
After 9 11, America s NATO allies invoked the mutual defense clause of the NATO treaty and offered to help the United States go after the Taliban and al Qaeda.
Convinced that the job would be easy and that allies would simply make things harder, the Rumsfeld Pentagon responded with a brusque  No, thanks.  Instead of making Afghanistan a collective project from the start, the Bush administration wanted to show it could do the job all by itself, with an assist from the Afghan Northern Alliance.
That decision seemed justified when the Taliban fell quickly, but when Bush & Co.
Iraq  see below , there was hardly anybody left to keep the Taliban from coming back.
By the time NATO got involved big-time, a new civil war was underway and the best opportunity to build a stable Afghanistan had been squandered.
2.
The United States invaded Afghanistan for one reason: to get Osama bin Laden and as many of his followers as possible.
S.
Battle of Tora Bora allowed bin Laden to escape into Pakistan, where he remained at large for another eight years.
Had we caught him then and there, al Qaeda might have been dealt a fatal blow and the United States could have declared victory in the  war on terror  instead of watching al Qaeda morph into a global franchise.
S.
Tora Bora -- Army Gen.
Tommy Franks -- was later chosen to command the invasion of Iraq.
3.
The Bonn Agreement in December 2001 established an interim government for post-Taliban Afghanistan and was, in many ways, an impressive diplomatic achievement.
Unfortunately, the Constitution adopted in 2004 was an ill-conceived misstep.
It created a highly centralized state that ignored Afghan traditions of local autonomy and gave the president too much formal power.
The new government was supposed to run the entire country from Kabul and appoint all the key local officials, but the Karzai regime lacked enough competent civil servants and the new structure created irresistible opportunities for patronage and corruption.
Moreover, the Afghan economy could not support an elaborate governmental structure or large security forces, which made the fledgling Afghan state permanently dependent on outside support from the start.
4.
The Bush administration s decision to invade Iraq was not just a disaster for Iraq and for the United States, it also diverted military and intelligence resources from Afghanistan and allowed the Taliban to regroup and resume the war.
Sadly, we will never know what might have happened had the United States and NATO kept their eyes on the ball back in 2003.
5.
In the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama burnished his national security street cred by declaring that he was going to end the war in Iraq so that he could focus on the  real war  in Afghanistan.
S.
17,000 shortly after taking office and adding another 30,000 in the fall of 2009.
But the decision to escalate was fatally flawed, because the Taliban still had sanctuaries in neighboring Pakistan and were never going to be defeated by military force alone.
To succeed, the surge would have had to be far larger and much longer in duration, and Afghanistan simply wasn t worth that level of effort.
The surge also led to a sharp uptick in Afghan and American casualties, which gradually undermined support for the war back home.
6.
The mistaken decision to escalate was compounded by a second error: Obama made it clear from the start that the surge would be a temporary measure and gave the Taliban a pretty good idea when the United States would begin to get out.
As critics noted at the time, telling your adversary exactly when you were going to quit was hardly the best way to persuade them to give up the fight.
Instead, it told the enemy exactly how long they needed to hang on in order to wait us out.
7.
Ending the war and building a functioning Afghan government required a reconciliation process that would integrate the more moderate elements of the Taliban back into the Afghan political community.
Unfortunately, the United States didn t get serious about a peace process until it was too late.
S.
James Dobbins acknowledged last year ,  it was probably a mistake to delay a serious effort at reconciliation until 2011.  Washington should have pushed hard for serious discussions while the surge was at its peak, instead of waiting until its role  and therefore its leverage  was declining.
Iran .
8.
When the Taliban refused to give up bin Laden, the United States had no choice but to go after the man who had orchestrated the 9 11 attacks.
S.
And neither Bush nor Obama ever managed to persuade them that the war was worth the cost, mostly because the American people aren t completely gullible.
By 2008, the war was costing the American taxpayers an amount several times larger than Afghanistan s entire GDP, and neither Bush nor Obama could come up with a convincing rationale for continuing to pour money and lives into distant strategic backwater.
To be sure, Obama tried to justify the war as necessary to prevent al Qaeda from establishing a  safe haven  again, but al Qaeda already had better havens by 2009 and was barely in Afghanistan by that point.
Moreover, a long and costly war against the Taliban was increasingly a distraction from the broader campaign against al Qaeda itself.
Bottom line: the American people will support a war when vital interests are at stake and there is a plausible theory of victory, but by 2009, neither of those conditions had been met.
9.
Winning the war in Afghanistan depended on getting at least two foreign governments to play ball.
S.
S.
S.
Washington would never call their bluff.
It s a sad but familiar story: a once-powerful patron becomes too strongly committed to a weak client with its own agenda, that client extracts many concessions by threatening to collapse or by telling us one thing while doing another.
10.
S.
Afghanistan was bedeviled by strategic contradictions that were never fully recognized or resolved.
Although many American soldiers fought with skill and heroism, achieving our stated war aims was an uphill battle from the get-go.
For starters, the United States and NATO couldn t win without a much larger investment of resources over a much longer period, but it just wasn t worth that level of investment.
S.
Army was never designed for or adept at this kind of operation and isn t likely to get much better at it with practice.
And finally, building a new Afghan state and fighting a counterinsurgency war required outsiders to pour billions of dollars into an impoverished country, but the flood of poorly managed money merely fueled corruption and ensured that much of the aid money was wasted .
No one should take any pleasure in contemplating these  and other  mistakes, especially when one considers how long the United States fought there and how shallow its learning curve was.
S.
In the summer of 1970, on a teen tour across Scandinavia and Russia, I spent a week in Sochi, long before the $55 billion Olympic Village was even a twinkle in Vladimir Putin s eye.
The Soviets had invaded Czechoslovakia only two years before; the mighty eyebrows of Leonid Brezhnev, the ponderous party general secretary of that ponderous era, were still jet black.
The Soviet Union felt comatose; with military spending consuming much of the federal budget, everything was scarce.
In Leningrad -- that would be St.
Petersburg today -- our group went to an outdoor  Georgian-style  shashlik restaurant where, owing to the rationing of meat, we each received precisely 3 ounces of gristly beef along with our grilled onions and peppers.
Ah, but Sochi; that was our beach vacation.
The salubrious climate, with mountains not far away, had made Sochi Russia s tuberculosis capital.
As soon as we arrived, the guides assigned to us informed us that Sochi had 60 sanatoriums; we would have the opportunity to visit many of them.
From our first visit I recall only long hallways, tiled floors, high ceilings, vast lounges with slippered patients.
We begged off the other 59.
In those days, travel in the Soviet Union was organized either by Intourist, a giant state bureaucracy, or Sputnik, the travel arm of the Communist Youth League.
We went Sputnik, which is to say, bargain basement.
Our hotel was a giant white block at the edge of the beach.
We ate all three meals in the cafeteria.
All three were the same -- boiled sausages, kasha, and black bread.
In the morning, but only in the morning, we got butter with our bread.
At lunch, our stewed fruit juice appeared also to have been smoked.
None of us complained about only receiving 3 ounces of meat.
This being Russia, alcohol was practically free.
Vodka was $1 a bottle; so was champagne; so was cognac.
In what now strikes me as a suspicious coincidence, it seemed that many of us were celebrating birthdays during this period.
In the evenings, our two tour leaders, who held on to the money, would stock up on alcohol, and we would camp out on the grass not far from the kiosk that sold crumb cakes.
Although I had already begun drinking wine, I can thank the Soviet Union for teaching me how to drink.
I was 15, which I suppose by Russian standards was a very advanced age for a beginner.
You may, by now, have seen pictures of Sochi s famous beach.
It was not a sand beach, nor even the fine pebble beach you find on volcanic islands.
The beach consisted of rocks.
Somehow, this seemed exactly right.
What it meant, however, was that you couldn t lie comfortably on a towel, especially not on the threadbare towels handed out by our Sputnik hotel.
Also, the rocks heated up in the course of the day so that by the afternoon you had to run straight into the water to keep the bottom of your feet from roasting.
The Russians did not, themselves, do a great deal of swimming.
These were large, very pale persons who were generally content to remain immobile.
A vacation in Sochi was a reward for Stakhanovite achievement, which in 1970 I suppose would mean things like exceeding production targets on the building of semi-functional black-and-white televisions.
The Russians around us seemed perfectly pleased with the room, the board, and the beach.
It was taken for granted among us that our rooms were bugged.
This may have been Cold War paranoia, but in several cases our Soviet guides dropped something into conversation that it would seem they only could have known from overhearing our private talks.
We then adopted the conceit that absolutely everything was bugged.
When we paddled out into the Black Sea on one of the rubber rafts the hotel made available, we staged elaborate bouts of disinformation.
All this comical hokum came to an abrupt end on the morning when our Sputnik guides presented to us a petition, already signed by patriotic Eastern Bloc youth, calling on the United States to halt the imperialist war in Vietnam.
Bear in mind that this was 1970.
The anti-war movement was peaking.
Most of us were between left and left of left.
I can t remember whether I was a socialist or a social democrat.
Or maybe an anarchist.
In any case, we were all for signing.
Here, fortunately, we were rescued by our trip leaders.
Toby, a dancer who I suppose was all of 23, said,  If you guys sign this today, there will be an article next week in the International Herald Tribune with the headline,  Americans Sign Russian Petition Condemning Vietnam War.  And it will have a list of your names.   We acknowledged that that was a good point.
Also, a dirty trick by our hosts.
By this time in history, pro-Soviet sympathies had long since been purged from the American left.
None of us needed de-programming.
Nevertheless, the experience of this dank, cheerless, monochrome country cured us of whatever lingering sense we might have had of the virtues of collectivism.
We boarded our Aeroflot flight to Helsinki, making sure to take the hard candies we were offered on board to prevent our ears from popping in the poorly pressurized cabin.
When we arrived, I recall that a few of my friends kissed the tarmac.
Thank God for Europe!
Sochi will now serve as the international showcase of a Russia that is no longer dank, cheerless, and monochrome.
The billions of dollars lavished on the city have bought, according to Russia scholar Leon Aron,  40 new and refurbished hotels, 220 miles of new or reconstructed roads, 125 miles of rail, a dozen tunnels stretching 16 miles and cutting through the mountains,  and so on.
A report from the International Crisis Group notes that while  the virtually nonfunctioning sewage system had made the Black Sea, unbeknownst to tourists, risky for swimming  -- now they tell us!
The report also notes, incredibly, that President Putin plans to develop the tourist potential of the North Caucasus with a chain of ski resorts in Dagestan, Ingushetia, and even Chechnya.
In the old Soviet Union, success meant that you got to spend a week basking on rocks and eating boiled sausage that someone else had cooked.
Now you get to go heli-skiing  with armed bodyguards .
That s progress, at least for the 1 percent.
But Sochi is a gigantic monument, by many accounts ruinously wasteful and spectacularly corrupt, to the whims of a dictator.
The Sochi we will see on television is a gold-plated Potemkin village, its bedraggled citizens swept out of camera range.
It s too crude to compare Putin to the blood-drenched Joseph Stalin.
A more just analogy would be the era of the Romanov tsars, when a glittering aristocracy presided over a vast, benumbed populace.
How long, you wonder, will they stay numb?
Addendum: In last week s column , I gave the impression that David Kilcullen is a counterinsurgency  COIN  enthusiast, albeit a disappointed one.
Not true, he says.

WikiLeaks today released over 75,000 secret US military reports covering the war in Afghanistan.
The Afghan War Diary is an extraordinary secret compendium of over 91,000 reports covering the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010.
The reports describe the majority of lethal military actions involving the United States military.
They include the number of persons internally stated to be killed, wounded, or detained during each action, together with the precise geographical location of each event, and the military units involved and major weapon systems used.
The Afghan War Diary is the most significant archive about the reality of war to have ever been released during the course of a war.
The deaths of tens of thousands is normally only a statistic but the archive reveals the locations and the key events behind each most of these deaths.
We hope its release will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the war in Afghanistan and provide the raw ingredients necessary to change its course.
Most entries have been written by soldiers and intelligence officers listening to reports radioed in from front line deployments.
However the reports also contain related information from Marines intelligence, US Embassies, and reports about corruption and development activity across Afghanistan.
Each report consists of the time and precise geographic location of an event that the US Army considers significant.
It includes several additional standardized fields.
The type field specifies the event as combat, non-combat, propaganda, and so on.
The category field gives a more specific classification from the US Forces.
Further labels detail how many were detained, wounded, and killed from civilian, allied, host nation, and enemy forces, give the name of the reporting unit, and other information.
The most significant field is the summary, which is an English language description of the events that are covered in the report.
The Diary is available on the web and can be viewed in chronological order and by by over 100 categories assigned by the US Forces such as:  escalation of force ,  friendly-fire ,  development meeting , etc.
The reports can also be viewed by our  severity  measure-the total number of people killed, injured or detained.
All incidents have been placed onto a map of Afghanistan and can be viewed on Google Earth limited to a particular window of time or place.
In this way the unfolding of the last six years of war may be seen.
The material shows that cover-ups start on the ground.
When reporting their own activities US Units are inclined to classify civilian kills as insurgent kills, downplay the number of people killed or otherwise make excuses for themselves.
The reports, when made about other US Military units are more likely to be truthful, but still down play criticism.
Conversely, when reporting on the actions of non-US ISAF forces the reports tend to be frank or critical and when reporting on the Taliban or other rebel groups, bad behavior is described in comprehensive detail.
The behavior of the Afghan Army and Afghan authorities are also frequently described.
The reports come from US Army with the exception most Special Forces activities.
The reports do not generally cover top-secret operations or European and other ISAF Forces operations.
However when a combined operation involving regular Army units occurs, details of Army partners are often revealed.
For example a number of bloody operations carried out by Task Force 373, a secret US Special Forces assassination unit, are exposed in the Diary -- including a raid that lead to the death of seven children.
This archive shows the vast range of small tragedies that are almost never reported by the press but which account for the overwhelming majority of deaths and injuries.
We have delayed the release of some 15,000 reports from total archive as part of a harm minimization process demanded by our source.
After further review, these reports will be released, with occasional redactions, and eventually, in full, as the security situation in Afghanistan permits.
The Afghan War Diary  AWD for short  consists of messages from several important US military communications systems.
The messaging systems have changed over time; as such reporting standards and message format have changed as well.
This reading guide tries to provide some helpful hints on interpretation and understanding of the messages contained in the AWD.
Most of the messages follow a pre-set structure that is designed to make automated processing of the contents easier.
It is best to think of the messages in the terms of an overall collective logbook of the Afghan war.
The AWD contains the relevant events, occurrences and intelligence experiences of the military, shared among many recipients.
The basic idea is that all the messages taken together should provide a full picture of a days important events, intelligence, warnings, and other statistics.
Each unit, outpost, convoy, or other military action generates report about relevant daily events.
The range of topics is rather wide: Improvised Explosives Devices encountered, offensive operations, taking enemy fire, engagement with possible hostile forces, talking with village elders, numbers of wounded, dead, and detained, kidnappings, broader intelligence information and explicit threat warnings from intercepted radio communications, local informers or the afghan police.
It also includes day to day complaints about lack of equipment and supplies.
The description of events in the messages is often rather short and terse.
To grasp the reporting style, it is helpful to understand the conditions under which the messages are composed and sent.
Often they come from field units who have been under fire or under other stressful conditions all day and see the report-writing as nasty paperwork, that needs to be completed with little apparent benefit to expect.
So the reporting is kept to the necessary minimum, with as little type-work as possible.
The field units also need to expect questions from higher up or disciplinary measures for events recorded in the messages, so they will tend to gloss over violations of rules of engagement and other problematic behavior; the reports are often detailed when discussing actions or interactions by enemy forces.
Once it is in the AWD messages, it is officially part of the record - it is subject to analysis and scrutiny.
The truthfulness and completeness especially of descriptions of events must always be carefully considered.
Circumstances that completely change the meaning of an reported event may have been omitted.
The reports need to answer the critical questions: Who, When, Where, What, With whom, by what Means and Why.
The AWD messages are not addressed to individuals but to groups of recipients that are fulfilling certain functions, such as duty officers in a certain region.
The systems where the messages originate perform distribution based on criteria like region, classification level and other information.
The goal of distribution is to provide those with access and the need to know, all of the information that relevant to their duties.
In practice, this seems to be working imperfectly.
The messages contain geo-location information in the forms of latitude-longitude, military grid coordinates and region.
The messages contain a large number of abbreviations that are essential to understanding its contents.
When browsing through the messages, underlined abbreviations pop up an little explanation, when the mouse is hovering over it.
The meanings and use of some shorthands have changed over time, others are sometimes ambiguous or have several meanings that are used depending on context, region or reporting unit.
Location names are also often shortened to three-character acronyms.
Messages may contain date and time information.
Most common are Z  Zulu Time, aka.
UTC time zone , D  Delta Time, aka.
UTC + 4 hours  and B  Bravo Time, aka UTC + 2 hours .
Other times are noted without any time zone identifier at all.
The Afghanistan time zone is AFT  UTC + 4:30 , which may complicate things further if you are looking up messages based on local time.
Finding messages relating to known events may be complicated by date and time zone shifting; if the event is in the night or early morning, it may cause a report to appear to be be misfiled.
It is advisable to always look through messages before and on the proceeding day for any event.
The message starts with a unique ReportKey; it may be used to find messages and also to reference them.
The next field is DateOccurred; this provides the date and time of the event or message.
See Time and Date formats for details on the used formats.
Type contains typically a broad classification of the type of event, like Friendly Action, Enemy Action, Non-Combat Event.
It can be used to filter for messages of a certain type.
Category further describes what kind of event the message is about.
There are a lot of categories, from propaganda, weapons cache finds to various types of combat activities.
TrackingNumber Is an internal tracking number.
Title contains the title of the message.
Summary is the actual description of the event.
Usually it contains the bulk of the message content.
Region contains the broader region of the event.
AttackOn contains the information who was attacked during an event.
ComplexAttack is a flag that signifies that an attack was a larger operation that required more planning, coordination and preparation.
This is used as a quick filter criterion to detect events that were out of the ordinary in terms of enemy capabilities.
ReportingUnit, UnitName, TypeOfUnit contains the information on the military unit that authored the report.
Wounded and death are listed as numeric values, sorted by affiliation.
WIA is the abbreviation for Wounded In Action.
KIA is the abbreviation for Killed In Action.
Captured enemies are numbered in the field EnemyDetained.
The location of events are recorded in the fields MGRS  Military Grid Reference System , Latitude, Longitude.
The next group of fields contains information on the overall military unit, like ISAF Headquarter, that a message originated from or was updated by.
Updates frequently occur when an analysis group, like one that investigated an incident or looked into the makeup of an Improvised Explosive Device added its results to a message.
If an activity that is reported is deemed  significant , this is noted in the field Sigact.
Significant activities are analyzed and evaluated by a special group in the command structure.
Affiliation describes if the event was of friendly or enemy nature.
DColor controls the display color of the message in the messaging system and map views.
Messages relating to enemy activity have the color Red, those relating to friendly activity are colored Blue.

Noted documentary photographer Robert Nickelsberg s photographs help bring into focus the day-to-day consequences of war, poverty, oppression, and political turmoil in Afghanistan.
This remarkable volume of photographs is accompanied by insightful texts from experts on Afghanistan and the Taliban.
The images themselves are captioned with places, dates, and Nickelsberg s own extensive commentary.
Timely and important, the book serves as a reminder that Afghanistan and the rest of the world remain inextricably linked, no matter how much we long to distance ourselves from its painful realities.
ROBERT NICKELSBERG has been a photographer for Time magazine for nearly thirty years.
His work in Afghanistan has also appeared on The New York Times  Lens  blog and his images have appeared in Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, CNN, and NBC.

Robert Nickelsberg has been traveling to Afghanistan since the late 1980s as a photojournalist to document the seemingly endless wars that have engulfed that fascinating and unfortunate country.
Taliban and Al Qaeda following 9 11.
S.
As such, this definitive document captures in images a quarter century of Afghanistan s tumultuous history -- including the haunting portraits of commanders, warlords, drug smugglers, bomb makers, foot soldiers, as well as riveting shots of the ever-present and ever-suffering civilians.
Through it all, Nickelsberg documents what he sees with an unwavering eye and exceptional courage.
I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in war photography, reportage, Afghanistan, current events and history.
There will come a time when this book becomes scarce and hard to find.
Now is the time to get one while you can.
An indispensable addition to collections of photojournalism and libraries on Afghanistan and South Asia.

Aesthetically,  Afghanistan: A Distant War,   is nearly flawless.
Nickelsberg s beautiful photographs; Prestel s elegant design and printing; and Jon Lee Anderson s dead-on Foreword  which should be subtitled  Afghanistan for Dummies   together create a model for war photography books in an era where bound books, especially expensive, large format photography books, are an endangered literary species.
When one reads  Afghanistan  and sits staring at the double page, three-dimensional contrast of shadow and light and the rhythmic synergy of action shots against somber portraiture, it s possible to believe that print photography is not summarily doomed after all.
Nickelsberg understands the need for synchronicity of photographs and text.
Not all photographers have the good sense to do so, since more than a few, along with editors and curators, believe that a photograph that somehow requires words to explain it must not be  art.  It supposedly speaks for itself if it captures the  decisive moment  or, in the case of war photography, offers shock value, a bar that seems to get higher by the minute.

If you buy just one book on Afghanistan, this is the one.
Robert Nickelsberg brings a whole new meaning to the word commitment with this stunning photography book, covering decades of conflict and life in Afghanistan.
His pictures are courageous, haunting, often beautiful, and always insightful.
The essays accompanying the powerful images are just as good, written by leading commentators like the New Yorker s Jon Lee Anderson.
I have spent quite a bit of time in Afghanistan myself, but learned more from this book than from any more academic account.
Nickelsberg had produced a masterpiece, and this is a masterpiece that literally took decades of trips to this beautiful and tragic country.
You ll discover a country both tragic and magic, as you accompany Nickelsberg on his journey through time.
This book will become a classic, and you ll find yourself revisiting it often and sharing it with friends.

Nickelberg is one of the unsung heroes of photojournalism.
His reportage covering most American conflicts since El Salvador.
His coverage of Afghanistan is extensive and very poignant and visually intriguing.
Nickelsberg is one of the last of a vanishing breed of true professionalism in photography and war coverage.
This is a must see book on the long war in the  Stan.

British troops launch one final attack on the Taliban – just hours before the end of combat operations in Afghanistan.
Royal Artillery men inside Camp Bastion, Helmand, fired 105mm shells which smashed into enemy positions miles outside the wire.
The salvo on Saturday night was the last after 13 years of ferocious fighting involving 140,000 troops.
Of those, 453 were killed and 2,188 were wounded.
As the withdrawal was finalised , Defence Secretary Michael Fallon admitted the Taliban was still waging a bloody insurgency and there was no guarantee of a stable future.
But he insisted: “We are not going to send combat troops back into Afghanistan – we’ve made that clear.
During an emotionally charged ceremony at Camp Bastion yesterday, British and American troops stood side by side as the Union Flag and Stars and Stripes were lowered.
The British flag was presented to Brigadier Rob Thomson – the most senior officer and an ex-commander in flashpoint town Sangin, where more than 100 of our troops died.
He said: “There’s a whole heart full of emotions that runs through you when something like that happens.
The first emotion is one of pride.
Pride to the bottom of our boots that we can leave Helmand heads held high with a job well done.
And one also remembers those who have been wounded.
Our forces have been in ­Afghanistan since 2001, just after 9-11.
But after they helped US troops and the Northern Alliance rout the Taliban, the extremists re-emerged in Helmand – Afghanistan’s most unruly province.
In March 2006 our troops were sent there on a three-year peacekeeping mission but it became the longest campaign of modern times, outlasting both World Wars combined.
Mr Fallon said Britain’s ­involvement in stopping Afghanistan from becoming a “safe haven for terrorism” meant it was “mission accomplished”.
But the Defence Secretary warned: “There is no ­guarantee that Afghanistan is going to be stable and safe.
Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted Britain’s commitment to the country must not end with withdrawal.
Yesterday’s ceremony marked the handover of Helmand to the Afghans.
Only 1,000 British and US troops remain and they will leave soon.
The honour of drawing down the Union flag was left to Scots Guards Sergeant Major John Lilley, 43, and Royal Navy Captain Matthew Clark, 46.
Sgt Maj Lilley, of Glasgow, saw heavy fighting in 2009.
He said: “It’s hard to put the emotions into words because we’ve left a lot of people here, it’s sad, but we’re not here to deliver milk.
It’s something that will live with you for the rest of your life and for generations to come.
At the height of the war, 9,500 troops were spread across Helmand battling daily with the Taliban from 137 bases.
Prince Harry is among the veterans having served two tours in 2007-8 and 2012-13.
He has continued to support injured soldiers and even set up the Invictus Games in their honour.
At the centre of the war effort was Camp Bastion – a 1,600 acre military metropolis the size of Reading and home to more than 40,000 people.
Its roads were choked with convoys, vast canteens the size of football fields were crammed with hungry troops while it hosted gyms, coffee shops, restaurants and even a Pizza Hut.
Sergeant Major Robert Mansel, 37, of Swansea, who is on his 11th tour, said: “It is a strange feeling.
Bastion has always been a hub of activity.
The base has been bought by the Afghan Government and will be­ ­inherited by its security forces.
Its hospital and canteens have been mothballed ready to be re-opened should the Afghans need them.
For Britain, the job of pulling out began back in 2012.
Since then, 9,500 troops, more than 5,000 shipping containers of gear plus 3,500 vehicles and major bits of machinery have been shipped out.
Brigadier Darrell Amison, who has been in charge of the massive move, said: “It’s been the biggest logistical operation of a generation.
Yet while Britain is withdrawing, the war against a battered but potent Taliban continues.
Since March, 272 Afghan soldiers and 506 policemen have been killed in Helmand and neighbouring Nimroz.
About 500 British troops will remain at the Afghan army officer training academy in Kabul.
A joint US and UK cell will act as advisers to the Afghans and millions of pounds has been promised to help train and improve the Afghan forces.

10 million per day on its new air war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, a relative pittance compared with the hundreds of millions it spent fighting every day in Afghanistan in 2013.
The costs in Iraq and Syria will escalate substantially if, as President Obama and Pentagon officials have said, the new war lasts for years, according to military analysts.
Flying and maintaining warplanes requires a substantial investment in weaponry and personnel.
If airstrikes in Syria and Iraq continue for as long as the president predicts, they will eventually cost tens of billions of dollars,  predicts Loren Thompson, a defense industry consultant and the military analyst at the Lexington Institute.  The price of munitions is just one part of the bill.
The Pentagon estimates that it is spending $7 million to $10 million per day in Iraq and Syria, Rear Adm.
John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters Thursday.
65 billion pales compared with the cost of fighting in Afghanistan.
7 billion.
That s a daily burn rate of more than $212 million per day.
9 billion.
The current estimate of the fight against the Islamic State is rough, Kirby acknowledged, and promised more precision in coming days.
There are, however, a few price points to consider in the cost of waging war.
1 million apiece.
40,000 each.
Wednesday s airstrikes, for example, involved the use of 18  precision  bombs, according to the Pentagon.
The major driver of cost is flight time for warplanes and steaming time for ships — not missiles or bombs, said Richard Aboulafia, a military aviation analyst with the Teal Group.
A warplane can cost at least $10,000 per hour to fly.
Aboulafia said.
Thompson also pointed out that some of the costs in the Middle East are already accounted for in the Pentagon s nearly $500 billion annual budget — war or no war.
Ships will sail.
Planes will fly.
And troops will be paid.
Thompson said.

Military Action Against ISIS: The military conflict with ISIS started on June 16, 2014.
So far, funds for the conflict have come from war funding allocated for Iraq and  or Afghanistan, and are included in spending on those conflicts.
These totals are based on appropriations that provide funding through the end of fiscal year 2014.
These         figures include both military and non-military spending, such as reconstruction.
Spending includes only         incremental costs – those additional funds that are expended due to the war.
For example, soldiers  regular pay is not included, but combat pay is included.
Potential future costs, such as future medical care for         soldiers and veterans wounded in the war, are not included.
These figures also do not include interest payments         on the national debt that will result from higher deficits due to war spending.
Total war funding, and costs of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, are based on analysis of legislation in which         Congress has allocated money for war, as well as research by the Congressional Research Service.
Cost of military action against ISIS is based on news reports of Pentagon cost estimates.

2 billion of that total is explicitly attached to Afghanistan, National Priorities Project has         determined that all remaining OCO funds not explicitly designated for another country should be allocated to         Afghanistan, given that no other major contingency operations are ongoing.
9 billion for fiscal year 2014.
7 billion funded such operations in Iraq.
According to the legislative language in the Consolidated         Appropriations Act, 2014, the majority of these State Department OCO funds were not designated toward any         country-specific effort.
To provide accurate accounting of these undesignated funds, the more detailed Department of State Congressional Budget Justification for fiscal year 2014 was analyzed to determine what         percentages of the total OCO requests were related to Iraq and Afghanistan, respectively.
On the premise         that State Department priorities for fiscal year 2014 operations remained constant between the time that         passed between its budget request and appropriations, these percentages were applied to the total OCO         funds appropriated to the State Department in order to derive country-specific totals for efforts in Iraq         and Afghanistan.
In addition, the January 2014 Congressional Research Service report State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs: FY2014 Budget and Appropriations was used a resource.

To assign the state percentages, we use state-level data from the IRS s Individual Master File System.

To get the percentage for each state, we divide its Income tax amount by the US Income         tax amount .
Zip code tabulation areas  ZCTAs  are the Census Bureau s version of postal service zip codes.
The basis         for all sub-state multipliers is ZCTA rather than the USPS zip code, because ZCTAs can be allocated to other         geographic areas of interest, such as congressional districts and counties.

The Individual Income Tax ZIP Code Data is also the basis for the county, place, and         congressional district taxes paid.
To get those numbers, we follow steps 1 and 2 above.
Then we match the         ZCTAs with county, place, and 113th congressional district boundaries using the Missouri Census         Data Center s MABLE Geographic             Correspondence Engine with Census 2010 Geography .
MABLE maps each ZCTA to a county or counties.
Separate downloads do the same thing for places and congressional         districts.
When a ZCTA covers more than one county, place, or congressional district, MABLE provides         an allocation to describe how much of the ZCTA belongs to each.
This allocation is Census         2010 population-based.
For example, consider ZCTA 19317 in Pennsylvania.
According to MABLE, 45% of the 19317 population live in Chester         County, and 55% live in Delaware.
Therefore, when determining the income taxes paid for each county, 45%         of the 19317 amount will be assigned to Chester, and 55% will be assigned to Delaware.
Once we have the allocations from MABLE, we do the following calculations three times—once each for         counties, places, and congressional districts.
For each ZCTA, multiply the taxes paid  from the ZCTA-summarized IRS data  by the allocation percentage for             its corresponding counties places congressional districts.
Summarize the results by county places congressional district to get the total income taxes paid for that             area.

Taken together, these materials suggest some lessons that might be drawn from the Soviet experience of fighting a war in Afghanistan.
Both Chief of USSR General Staff Marshal Ogarkov and his Deputy General of the Army Akhromeev voiced strong objections to introducing troops on the grounds that the proposed limited contingent of forces would not be able to fulfill its objectives.
According to Soviet veterans of the events, KGB sources were trusted over the military intelligence  GRU  sources.
This partly reflected the growing influence of the KGB Chairman Yu.
V.
S.
Such conceptualization of the situation led to the attempts to impose alien social and economic practices on Afghan society, such as the forced land reform.
Reports from Afghanistan show the growing awareness of the Islamic factor on the part of Soviet military and political personnel.
The Afghan communist PDPA never was a unified party; it was split along ethnic and tribal lines.
The Soviet underestimation of ethnic tensions within Afghan society was one of the reasons of the unsuccessful policy of national reconciliation.
It was one of the key factors in the delegitimization of Communist Party rule.
The army was demoralized as a result of being perceived as an invader.
The image of the Soviet Army fighting against Islam in Afghanistan also contributed to a rapid rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the Central Asian republics and possibly to the strengthening of the independence movement in Chechnya, both of which continue to pose major security threats to Russia today.
The Soviet Army also quickly realized the inadequacy of its preparation and planning for the mission in Afghanistan.
The Soviet reservists, who comprised the majority of the troops initially sent in, were pulled into full-scale combat operations against the rebels, while the regular Afghan army was often unreliable because of the desertions and lack of discipline.
Soviet traditional weaponry and military equipment, especially armored cars and tanks were extremely vulnerable on Afghani terrain.
Then the mission was changed once again, but the leadership was not willing to admit that the Soviet troops were essentially fighting the Afghan civil war for the PDPA.
The notion of the internationalist duty that the Soviet Limited Contingent was fulfilling in Afghanistan was essentially ideological, based on the idea that Soviet troops were protecting the socialist revolution in Afghanistan whereas the experience on the ground immediately undermined such justifications.
The issue of troop withdrawal and the search for a political solution was discussed as early as 1980, but no real steps in that direction were taken, and the Limited Contingent continued to fight in Afghanistan without a clearly defined objective.
Among the most important memoirs on the Soviet war in Afghanistan are those by former Deputy USSR Foreign Minister Georgy M.
Some of the most important documents on the Soviet War in Afghanistan were published in the English translation in the Cold War International History Project Bulletin, No.
8-9, Winter 1996-1997.
The documents presented below provide an insight into some of the most important aspects of the Soviet decision making on the Afghan war from the decision to send in the troops to the decision to withdraw the Soviet Limited Contingent.
In some cases we have also included the cover page of the original Russian document.

The decision arrived at after much deliberation and summed up by General Secretary Leonid I.
Brezhnev was that economic and military assistance with equipment and advisers would be provided but no Soviet troops would be sent to Afghanistan.

According to former USSR Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin, this unusual memorandum from Andropov to Brezhnev was especially influential in changing the General Secretarys position on the issue of sending Soviet troops into Afghanistan.
Georgy Kornienkos Account of the Politburo Decision to Send Soviet Troops in Afghanistan, from Georgy M.
Kornienko, The Cold War: Testimony of a Participant,  Moscow, Mezhdunarodnye otnosheniya, 1994  pp.
Excerpts from Lyakhovskys book and Georgy M.
The only documentary evidence of that highly secret decision is the handwritten document On the Situation in A of December 12, 1979 signed by the Politburo members.

Lyakhovsky and other authors report that at the same time, the top Soviet military and political leadership held secret deliberations on the possibility of early withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan.
Nevertheless, the first combat operations of the Soviet troops led to the change in the original mission of the Limited Contingent to include combat operations against the rebels.

In the history of Afghanistan, the internal conflict between anti-Communist Muslim guerrillas and the Afghan communist government  aided from 1979 to 1989 by Soviet troops .
The roots of the war lay in the overthrow of the centrist Afghanistan government in April 1978 by left-wing military officers, who then handed power over to two Marxist-Leninist political parties, the Khalq  “Masses”  and Parcham  “Flag” , who together had formed the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
Having little popular support, the new government forged close ties with the Soviet Union, launched ruthless purges of all domestic opposition, and began extensive land and social reforms that were bitterly resented by the devoutly Muslim and largely anti-Communist population.
Muslim tribal-based insurgencies arose against the government, and these uprisings, along with internal fighting and coups between the Khalq and Parcham governmental factions, prompted the invasion of the country by about 30,000 Soviet troops in December 1979 with the aim of propping up the Soviet Union’s new but faltering client state.
The rebellion of the Muslim rebels, or mujahideen  literally, “strugglers” , grew in response, spreading to all parts of the country.
The Soviets initially left the suppression of the rebellion to the Afghan army, but the latter was rapidly depleted by mass desertions and remained largely ineffective throughout the war.
The Afghan War quickly settled down into a stalemate, with about 100,000 Soviet troops controlling the cities, large towns, and major garrisons and the mujahideen roaming relatively freely throughout the countryside.
The Soviet troops tried to crush the insurgency by various tactics, but the guerrillas generally eluded their attacks.
The Soviets then attempted to eliminate the mujahideen’s civilian support by bombing and depopulating the rural areas.
5 million had fled to Iran.
The mujahideen were eventually able to neutralize Soviet air power through the use of shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles supplied by the United States.
The mujahideen were fragmented politically into a handful of different groups, and their military efforts remained uncoordinated throughout the war.
The quality of their arms and combat organization gradually improved, however, owing to experience and to arms shipments sent by the United States and other countries via Pakistan.
In 1988 the United States, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union signed an agreement for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the return of Afghanistan to nonaligned status.
In April 1992, various rebel groups, together with newly rebellious government troops, stormed the besieged capital of Kabul, and the communist president, Mohammad Najibullah, was ousted from power.
A new transitional government, sponsored by various rebel factions, proclaimed an Islamic republic.

Afghanistan has long been used as a battleground for strategic wars by larger external powers.
This is in part due to its geographic position between the Middle East, Central Asia and South Asia.
In addition, the fragmented and polarised nature of Afghan society, which is made up of many different ethnic groups , has led to its multiple internal struggles which have gained support from the different external powers.
The almost continuous devastation caused to the country for over the past three decades is a testimony to the strength and endurance of its people and the groups who work towards rebuilding their country.
In 1978 the  Saur Revolution overthrew the existing government and implemented a Socialist agenda.
Led by Hafizullah Amin and the military of the Khalq party, the agenda included a move to state atheism, introduced land reforms, and declared the equality of the sexes.
Reigning President Mohammad Daoud Khan , along with 17 other members of his family, was overthrown and killed just hours after the start of the coup, whilst many members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment and the intelligentsia were also imprisoned, tortured or killed.
The revolutionaries went on to free prominent figures of the Khalq party, and Noor Mohammad Taraki was chosen as leader and President.
Following this, the Mujahedeen , loosely-aligned opposition forces made up of groups of mostly Pashtun tribesmen, began attacks aimed at overthrowing the Marxist-Leninist government, which was also under attack from separate attacks from other left-wing groups who disagreed with President Taraki.
The ruling party in turn requested the support of the Soviet Union in fighting the Mujahedeen resistance, removing the other left-wing opposition, and supporting the failing Afghan army.
There was an initial massive deployment of 100,000 Red Army troops into Afghanistan.
The US saw this as a prime opportunity to weaken the Soviet Union as part of its Cold War strategy , and they began to provide training and arms to the Mujahedeen resistance groups, along with extra support from other countries such as Saudi Arabia  who had their own agenda  and the UK.
There are many varied reports that the financial and military assistance from these external powers ranged from $10 to $40 billion over the nine-year conflict.
It officially ended in 1989 with the withdrawal of the Soviet forces.
5 million people disabled, in part due to the massive city carpet-bombing campaigns and the large areas of land mines that still exist today.
Two million people were internally displaced whilst one third of the country’s  pre-war population also fled into neighbouring Pakistan, Iran and further afield.
By 1992, the Communist government had collapsed and the Peshawar Accord declared Afghanistan to be the Islamic State of Afghanistan.
However, many groups refused to acknowledge the new government and the country soon fell into a civil war that lasted throughout the 1990s.
Working government departments, the police, justice systems and education systems did not have time to reform after the Soviet War and much of the country descended into lawlessness.
This led to areas being controlled by different armed factions, who in turn were supported by governments and groups in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan and the US.
In the early 1990s in Kandahar, a militia group called the Taliban  began to emerge as a political and religious force, which supposedly opposed the tyrannical rule of the local governor, and began to install greater order into the area.
Led by Mohammed Omar, it had the support of many Afghan refugees from Pakistan.
The group gained increasing recognition, power, and support as it began to take control of much of southern and central Afghanistan.
The Taliban was able to oust the existing weakened government and take over Kabul in September 1996, establishing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
Many of the Taliban’s leaders followed a fundamentalist version of Deobandi and Wahhabi Islam and a strict interpretation of Afghan social and cultural norms.
They enforced the most extreme version of Sharia law ever encountered in the modern Islamic world.
The Taliban became notorious internationally for its treatment of women, who had  amongst other things  to wear the burqa  a full face and body covering ; were not allowed outside the home without a related male chaperone; and were not permitted to work, or to be schooled, after the age of eight.
In some areas of Afghanistan, many forms of entertainment, including dance and music, were banned.
Many Pakistani nationals joined the Taliban to fight against the United Front’s forces whilst Osama bin Laden channelled more money into them, citing them as the only true Islamic state .
Bin Laden had been involved in the Soviet War, providing money to different militia groups to fight the Soviet forces.
He returned to Afghanistan in 1996 after having to flee Sudan and Saudi Arabia, and allegedly used the country as a base to plan and finance attacks internationally.
At the same time, the United Front, also known as the Northern Alliance, led by Ahmad Massoud , fought back against the Taliban stronghold.
Western support and financial assistance in the 1990s had dramatically decreased after the end of the Cold War; however, with the increase in the number of attacks on US embassies internationally from Islamist terrorist groups, attention began to increase once again with the US attacking suspected bases belonging to bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1998, along with the UN also ordering increasing sanctions on the Taliban.
In early 2001, Massoud appealed to the European Parliament for help and warned that there was information about a large-scale attack on US soil.
However, he was killed by a suicide bomb attack on 9 September 2001, two days before the attacks on the Twin Towers that shook the world.
In the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks, the US government quickly identified Osama bin Laden as responsible and claimed that the Taliban stronghold was harbouring him and refusing to hand him over.
They launched a series of aerial attacks on supposed al-Qaida bases under Taliban control and began militarily and financially supporting the Northern Alliance to bring down the Taliban.
The Taliban government in Kabul collapsed in December 2001, with many of the Taliban forces moving to the south and along the contested border with Pakistan.
Hamid Karzai was installed as President of the interim government in 2001, whilst other coalition forces joined the US and UK to fight against insurgency attacks in Afghanistan; with namely France, Germany and Italy supplying the most troops.
In 2004, the first Presidential elections were held, with Karzai winning 53 per cent of the votes, but with an extremely low voter turnout amid fears of election violence.
However, since 2006, there has been an increase in the levels of insurgency led by the Taliban who used mainly improvised explosives and suicide bomb attacks; a UN report has suggested that most of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan are the result of Taliban attacks.
With approximately 154,000 troops currently stationed there, the coalition military occupation is now in its tenth year.
In 2010 alone, an  estimated 10,000 people were killed .
At the end of 2010, the Obama administration pushed towards a final troop surge with an extra 30,000 US troops.
The US has given a date of July 2011 for when they want to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, with the aim of shifting control to Afghan security forces by 2014.
However, training of the forces and police has proved extremely difficult  due to a large number of suicide bomb attacks at recruitment centres, a drop-out rate of 25 per cent and a high level of drug addiction amongst troops.
Afghanistan is struggling to rebuild itself amidst the ongoing war despite the billions of dollars of aid that have been pumped into the country.
Life expectancy is 44 years, compared to an average of 53 years for other low-income countries worldwide.
The government is failing to extend its control or enter into negotiations with the Taliban, while the Taliban in turn refuse to enter into any negotiations until all foreign troops leave the country.
The opium trade has increased massively since 2001 and the occupying forces are unable to prevent it, with some of the proceeds allegedly going to members of the Karzai government.
Other forms of corruption remain rife in all sectors of society and some areas remain outside of government control.

In July 2010,  Wikileaks released a huge cache of 90,000 secret military files related to Afghanistan.
Revealing how the coalition forces had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, it also recorded the surge in Taliban attacks and the fear of support to the Taliban from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.
Throughout spring 2011, the Taliban launched a major offense , targeting government officials and buildings.
The attacks took place in Kandahar with the Taliban claiming to take over the city.
This inflamed insurgency, fuelled by the recent killing of Osama bin Laden, demonstrates how the Afghan government and Western forces are tilting at windmills of extremists groups, trapping the country in a spiral of violence.
There is no immediate end in sight to the Afghanistan conflict, and its complex issues and lack of stable governance mean that new conflicts will continue to rise.
However, there is a small but steady increase in the number of groups working towards building civil society on a local level and mediating conflicts.
The stance on development in Afghanistan is shifting slightly, with more awareness being given to locally-led projects as opposed to donor-led projects.
After more than three decades of conflict, the fatigue of war felt by its people is strong, and there is a definite need for a chance of a more tolerable situation in a country where many generations have only known war.

Special Forces Guilty of War Crimes?
S.
Special Forces base – was it a war crime or just another episode in a very dirty war?
In the fall of 2012, a team of American Special Forces arrived in Nerkh, a district of Wardak province, Afghanistan, which lies just west of Kabul and straddles a vital highway.
The members installed themselves in the spacious quarters of Combat Outpost Nerkh, which overlooked the farming valley and had been vacated by more than 100 soldiers belonging to the regular infantry.
S.
Army Green Berets, trained to wage unconventional warfare, and their arrival was typical of what was happening all over Afghanistan; the big Army units, installed during the surge, were leaving, and in their place came small groups of quiet, bearded Americans, the elite operators who would stay behind to hunt the enemy and stiffen the resolve of government forces long after America’s 13-year war in Afghanistan officially comes to an end.
A flier of Afghans who were seized by the Special Forces and never seen again.
But six months after its arrival, the team would be forced out of Nerkh by the Afghan government, amid allegations of torture and murder against the local populace.
If true, these accusations would amount to some of the gravest war crimes perpetrated by American forces since 2001.
S.
Special Forces and had subsequently disappeared, while another eight had been killed by the team during their operations.
S.
It’s always been that way.
Officials at the American-led International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, categorically denied these allegations, which came at an extremely delicate moment – as Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the American government were locked in still-unresolved negotiations over the future of American forces in Afghanistan.
Karzai is reluctant to grant.
S.
Afghan government and devastating for American power in the region.
Yet a story like the one brewing in Nerkh has the potential to sabotage negotiations.
Last winter, tensions peaked and President Karzai ordered an investigation into the allegations.
Then on February 16th, a student named Nasratullah was found under a bridge with his throat slit, two days, his family claimed, after he had been picked up by the Green Berets.
Mass demonstrations erupted in Wardak, and Karzai demanded that the American Special Forces team leave, and by April, it did.
That’s when the locals started finding bodies buried outside the American base in Nerkh, bodies they said belonged to the 10 missing men.
In July, the Afghan government announced that it had arrested Zikria Kandahari, a translator who had been working for the American team, in connection with the murders, and that in turn Kandahari had fingered members of the Special Forces for the crimes.
But the American military stuck to its denials.

Last year, on the morning of November 10th, a slight, meek-faced, 38-year-old farmer –  let’s call him Omar – with a fan-shaped beard and heavily callused hands, was standing with his neighbor, a 28-year-old shopkeeper and father of three named Gul Rahim, when they heard a bomb blast followed by gunfire.
The two had been trying to dig out a tree stump in front of Omar’s house, which looked out onto the village of Polad Khan, adjacent to the main road between the provincial capital of Maidan Shahr and Nerkh’s district center.
Nerkh, despite its orchards of apple trees and clean Himalayan air, is not an easy place to live.
Like much of Afghanistan’s rural population, the residents of the district, impoverished tenant farmers, are trapped between the inexorable pressures of the insurgency and the American military.
The militants, who have deep roots among the local population, will kill anyone who cooperates with the foreigners.
Even being seen talking to the Americans is a risk.
When the Taliban come to their houses at night, demanding food and shelter or the services of their sons, refusal can mean death.
And yet the presence of those militants might draw a drone strike or a raid from the Americans.
It is an impossible but daily dilemma.
A slip can be fatal.
After bodies were found, protests erupted.
S.
That November day, a roadside bomb had hit the American Special Forces team as it patrolled nearby, lightly injuring an American soldier and a translator.
Soon afterward, a convoy of Americans mounted on ATVs, followed by Afghan soldiers, came rumbling down the road.
Fearful, Omar and Gul Rahim put down their tools and went inside.
As they sat in the back room, surrounded by Omar’s young children, a burly, bearded American burst through the front door, accompanied by two Afghan translators who started searching the rooms.
They found the two men and yelled at them to get up; when Omar protested, one of the translators, Hamza, started kicking him, and his blows sent Omar crashing through his window into the garden.
As Omar lay stunned on the ground, his wife and kids rushed over, hysterical, and clutched at him to protect him, but Hamza fired several shots over their heads, killing a cow and scattering the woman and children.
He then dragged Omar into a small, walled apple orchard, where the other translator – a tall, sunken-eyed man who had taken the nom de guerre Zikria Kandahari, after his southern birthplace – was beating Gul Rahim in front of several Americans.
In the neighbor’s orchard, Americans had found the trigger wire for the bomb that had exploded earlier in the day.
As the two pleaded their innocence, one of the Americans came over and shoved Omar up against the wall, punching him.
Omar says he watched as Kandahari marched Gul Rahim about a dozen yards away, and as the Americans looked on, the translator raised his pistol to the back of Gul Rahim’s head and fired three shots.
When Kandahari turned and strode toward Omar, pointing his pistol at him, Omar fainted.
When he came to minutes later, he was being dragged into a Humvee.

Army maintained a bloody presence in Wardak province, trying to root out insurgents who hide in its deep, rugged valleys to launch attacks on nearby Kabul.
A flier of Afghans who were seized by the Special Forces and never seen again.
Zikria Kandahari, a translator for the A-Team, was arrested by the Afghan police in connection with the murders.
After bodies were found, protests erupted.
S.
Omar was the only civilian eyewitness to Gul Rahim’s killing, but in Wardak I spoke to three of his neighbors who said they had seen the American Special Forces arrive on their ATVs at Omar’s house, had heard gunshots and, after the soldiers had left, had seen Gul Rahim’s bullet-riddled body lying among the apple trees, his skull shattered.
Fearing that Omar too had been killed, his family searched for his body to no avail.
But Omar’s ordeal was just beginning.
He trembles as he recalls to me what happened next.
S.
Nerkh and put in a plywood cell, where he was left until the next morning.
Then the interrogations began.
He says his hands were bound above his head and he was suspended and then beaten by Kandahari and the bearded American.
There were two Americans and their translators interrogating him, and they asked him about Gul Rahim, and about well-known insurgent commanders in the area; Omar professed to know nothing.
He says the beatings intensified, and he fainted several times – they twisted his testicles, he admits shamefacedly.
The interrogation sessions continued for two days.
Bound to a chair and beaten, Omar was certain he would die.
At night, shackled in his plywood cell, he would recite verses from the Koran and think of his children.
At one point, Kandahari held a pistol to Omar’s head and told him that he would kill him as easily as he had killed his friend.
Of course they knew what was happening,” the accused translator, Kandahari, says.
Meanwhile, once Omar’s fellow villagers realized that the Americans had arrested him, they sent a delegation of elders to the police chief and the provincial governor to plead for Omar’s release.
Both said they were powerless, but by chance an American military officer was visiting the police headquarters.
The elders told the officer how Gul Rahim had been executed and Omar detained.
They said the American seemed surprised but skeptical and told them that he would look into the matter.
S.
That same evening, the Americans handed Omar over to the Afghan army soldiers who had a camp next door.
Omar suddenly realized he was being set free.
There is no security in Maidan Shahr,” mutters Mohammad Hazrat Janan, the deputy head of Wardak’s provincial council, as he gazes through the shattered windowpanes of his office.
A short, brusque politician who has grown wealthy during the Karzai regime, Janan is dismayed at the way the province seemed to be spiraling out of control.
An hour earlier, a massive car bomb had hit the Afghan intelligence compound nearby, knocking me and my translator to the floor while we were interviewing Omar and showering us with broken glass.
Janan says, pointing up the valley in the direction of Nerkh.
Maidan Shahr is only 30 minutes west of Kabul, but it seems to inhabit an alternate universe from the capital, where traffic-clogged streets are lined with fast-food stands and shops selling counterfeit designer goods.
Suicide bombings, like the one that had just blown out the windows, are common here in Wardak, as are Taliban ambushes on the main highway, which passes through the province on the way to the south of the country and is littered with bomb craters and burned-out tanker trucks.
War Crimes At least one corpse was found in a body bag.
There’s no possibility that Kandahari was acting without the Americans’ knowledge,” says an Afghan officer.
S.
Many of the men who disappeared in Nerkh were rounded up by the Americans in broad daylight, in front of dozens of witnesses.
One of the relatives I speak to, a wry, almond-eyed construction foreman named Neamatullah, tells me of a raid on November 20th, 2012, in his village of Amarkhel.
Around dawn, he and his four brothers and their families woke up to the sounds of motorcycles and ATVs in their village.
The bearded Americans broke down their front gate and entered with a dog.
They yanked the men outside while they searched the house, and then took them down to a collection point in the village, where they were rounding up the men of Amarkhel.
They ferried about 40 people to the Nerkh district center, where they sat for most of the day.
Eventually, the Americans scanned the retinas and fingerprints of the men, and swabbed their hands for explosives residue, and then, in front of local police and government officials, selected eight men to take to their base.
Neamatullah says three of his younger brothers, Hekmatullah, Sediqullah and Esmatullah, were among them.
The men were kept for two nights, one of which they spent in a suffocating shipping container, before most of them were released, including Hekmatullah, who says Kandahari and an American soldier had selected who would be set free.
When Hekmatullah, a 16-year-old student, finally came home, his family was overjoyed and hoped that Esmatullah and Sediqullah would soon be released too.
They never saw them again.
The Special Forces refused to let the villagers approach the base; the provincial government and the Afghan police and army said the matter was out of their hands.
Neamatullah and the relatives of the other missing men visited the Red Cross, which communicates with wartime detainees on behalf of their families, but he said they were unable to find the men in the main prison near Bagram or any other detention facility in the country.
It was as if the men had vanished.
A similar roundup occurred on December 6th in the nearby village of Deh Afghanan, after which another four men who were taken to the American base went missing.
By the time the Green Berets left Nerkh at the end of March, a total of 10 men had disappeared.
Another eight were allegedly killed by the A-Team out on patrol.
For example, on November 27th, four days after a truck bomb concealed under a load of firewood struck the provincial government headquarters in Maidan Shahr, locals say a driver who delivered firewood named Aziz Rehman was stopped by the Americans.
After the Special Forces left, they found Rehman lying next to a stream, badly beaten.
He died of his injuries on the way to a hospital in Kabul.
War Crimes?
At least one corpse was found in a body bag.
There’s no possibility that Kandahari was acting without the Americans’ knowledge,” says an Afghan officer.
Nerkh district is not an easy place to get to.
It’s only a few miles along paved tarmac from the provincial capital, but the thick apple orchards and mud-walled compounds that line the road offer cover for the insurgents, who plant bombs and snatch passengers from their cars.
The only way for me, my driver and my translator to get there is to attach ourselves to an Afghan army convoy heading to the district center.
The soldiers are terrified of roadside bombs, and their line of Humvees inches forward as they sweep the ground ahead on foot.
Halfway there, we are ambushed by machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades coming from nearby compounds.
50-caliber machine guns and RPGs, we leave our unarmored Corolla and lie flat in a ditch next to the road.
After the convoy gets moving again, the Afghan soldiers continue firing aimlessly into the villages and fields that we pass.
Later, when we find out that a boy and several cows have been killed in the crossfire, the Afghan officers shrug.
In a place like Nerkh, the shooting of a child is unremarkable for everyone but the family.
The district center, which lies on the north shoulder of the valley and commands a sweeping view of the fields and orchards below, has a besieged feel to it; the government and police officials that live in the compound rarely venture out into the villages.
Across the road from the district center is Combat Outpost Nerkh.
During the surge in 2009, a company of infantry pushed out from Maidan Shahr and reclaimed the valley for the Afghan government.
For several years, rotations of American infantry have come and gone from Nerkh, patiently practicing the techniques of counterinsurgency doctrine, each time holding shura meetings with the locals, where they would explain how they were here to bring the benefits of development and stability.
Those years have accomplished very little.
Nerkh has been a hotbed of guerrilla resistance since the war against the Soviets in the 1980s, when two mujahedeen groups, Harakat-e Islami and Hizb-e Islami, had held sway in the area.
By the late Nineties, the Harakatis had mostly joined the Taliban, whereas Hizb-e Islami had stayed independent.
They sometimes fought each other, but mostly they cooperated in an attempt to drive out the foreigners and the Karzai government.
Yet Nerkh couldn’t simply be abandoned.
With its proximity to Kabul, the district became an important staging ground for suicide attacks on the capital.
According to a senior Afghan official, during a recent Taliban attack in Kabul, militants had spoken on cellphones with handlers based in Nerkh.
S.
Army Special Forces encountered when it arrived in COP Nerkh in the fall.
These units are known as Operational Detachment Alpha, ODA, or A-Team.
The one in Nerkh, ODA 3124, was based in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and had deployed with ISAF in 2012.
They are part of the “white” Special Forces, which are supposed to wage a counterinsurgency in support of the Afghan government by holding key terrain and building up local militias, as opposed to the “black” Special Forces of the Joint Special Operations Command that launch night raids and work on covert, cross-border operations with the CIA.
Not that the Green Berets didn’t hunt the bad guys.
The 1st Battalion would face heavy fighting in Wardak; by the end of the deployment, five Green Berets would be killed in the province.
The rural areas in Nerkh are largely controlled by the insurgents; for the A-Team, every trip into the villages meant the chance of death or injury in an ambush or a roadside blast.
They’re venomously anti-American there.
S.
Nor did the team trust the local government officials and police, who had their own murky ties in the area.
They were especially suspicious of the Afghan Local Police commander, a bulky jawed man named Hajji Turakai, who has the heavy paunch and mitts of a retired prizefighter.
The ALP is a militia program started by the Americans that aims to recruit local armed groups; Turakai had been a Hizb-e Islami commander during the Soviet war, but had thrown in his lot with the Americans once they arrived in the district.
He maintained a little militia force that hung on to a section of Nerkh, probably by cutting deals with his erstwhile insurgents’ comrades.
That’s how the war works.
It was actually a previous group of Special Forces operating out of Maidan Shahr that had first set up Turakai and his ALP unit, but the new A-Team wanted nothing to do with him.
They said I was cooperating with the enemy,” Turakai tells me at the district center.
During the December 6th raid in Deh Afghanan, the A-Team arrested Turakai’s nephew.
When Turakai met with the Special Forces to plead his nephew’s innocence, he says that the A-Team’s officer, a young captain named Timothy Egan, became enraged and said Turakai’s nephew had admitted that his uncle was supplying weapons to the militants.
In a scene witnessed by several Afghan policemen, Egan put a pistol to Turakai’s head.
The Americans wanted to take him away, but when they saw me, they let him go,” one Nerkh police officer tells me.
After that, Turakai left the district, not returning until after the A-Team was forced out at the end of March.
The missing men’s families, acting on a tip, got permission to dig inside the base for bodies but didn’t find anything.
Then, about a week later, a shepherd, who had moved his flock onto the previously untouchable grounds just outside the American base, came to Turakai and said that he had seen a feral dog digging at human remains.
A group of relatives and local officials arrived and found several bone fragments, including the lower portion of a human jaw, along with distinctive clothing that led them to believe they were the remains of Mohammad Qasim, a 39-year-old farmer who was the first person to disappear after being arrested by the Special Forces in his home village of Karimdad on November 6th, 2012.
Over the next two months, human remains were found in six different sites on the flat, barren grounds around the base.
The first relatively intact corpse was uncovered in an irrigation ditch, dug up by farmers who went to clear it out.
S.
We had absolutely nothing to do with that man’s death,” Col.
S.
Other remains had been scavenged by the wild dogs that inhabit the area.
Some showed traces of burning, along with what appeared to be the remnants of body bags.
The closest site was about 50 yards from the base, and all were within sight of the guard towers.
When I ask the Afghan army commander who had taken over COP Nerkh after the Green Berets’ exit if there was any way that someone could bury a body 50 yards outside his perimeter without him being aware of it, he laughs.
There is no possibility,” he says, pointing out that his guard towers have clear lines of sight in all directions over the flat ground.
No one could start digging outside the base without attracting immediate attention.
When I show photos of the remains to Stefan Schmitt, director of the International Forensic Program at Physicians for Human Rights, who has extensive experience examining mass graves in Afghanistan, he says that Sayed Mohammad’s corpse, given its relatively intact condition, is consistent with its having been buried at the start of the cold winter season.
Neamatullah was part of the group of relatives and officials that would go and examine the grisly finds and try to identify the remains according to the clothing and other personal artifacts found with them.
Jihadyar, a civil servant whose brother Mohammad Hassan was arrested by the Americans, recognized his brother by the matching watches he had bought.
The most damaged remains were taken to the government forensic medicine center in Kabul, but lacking DNA testing capabilities, they could only ascertain that they were human.
Nevertheless, by June 4th, the families had found 10 sets of remains that they believed matched the 10 missing persons.
At the second-to-last site, Neamatullah says he recognized the clothes his brothers were wearing; he wept as their bodies came out of the ground.
In July, a few months after the A-Team had left Nerkh, the Afghan government announced that it had arrested the team’s translator, Zikria Kandahari.
Officials had a video of Kandahari beating Sayed Mohammad in custody and accused him of murder.
They also said that he professed his innocence, and that he blamed members of the A-Team for the killings.
But Kandahari hadn’t spoken to the media until after his August transfer to Pul-e Charkhi, the main prison in Kabul, and I decided to pay him a visit.
Pul-e Charkhi was the scene of horrific massacres by the communists at the end of the 1970s, and its reputation has never really recovered.
The main building is a wheel of concrete cell blocks in severe Soviet style, but it has since expanded into a sprawling compound of moldering barracks and weedy courtyards, occupied by thousands of inmates, many of them Taliban fighters.
I am led by a prison guard up to Kandahari’s cell block.
On the other side of a chain-link fence, a line of bored-looking men lean into the wire and watch me with interest.
Crowded into cells, the inmates largely regulate themselves.
Stabbings and gang violence are common.
One A-Team interpreter says he witnessed abusive interrogations.
They beat people – they had to,” he says.
The guard brings me into the office of the block supervisor, and I sit down on a sofa, where a steaming cup of green tea and a plate of grapes are put in front of me.
After about 15 minutes, a tall, bearded young man with stooped shoulders, clad in a dark shalwar kameez and waistcoat, enters the room and regards me warily.
I ask him.
He assents.
I ask.
He pauses.
Yeah, man,” he replies and clasps my hand.
We sit down on a couch together, and the prison guard soon loses interest in our English conversation.
Kandahari has an intense face, enhanced by his gauntness, protruding cheekbones, beetling dark brows and sunken eyes.
On his right arm, he has his real name, Zikria Noorzai, tattooed, along with a green sword.
Pul-e Charkhi is a bad place for him to be, he says.
There are plenty of people in here that he himself has put behind bars, plenty of Taliban.
He taps his right sleeve and lowers his voice.
I made myself a knife by sharpening some metal,” he says.
He tells me that his father was killed during the Soviet war, and so it had been up to him to provide for his mother and sister.
He grew up in Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban and – though he looks older – claims that he first started working for the Americans at the age of 14 in 2003.
It’s not your age, brother,” he says, bumping his fist against his chest.
S.
Special Forces had set up camps.
He says he started as a driver for military intelligence but soon graduated to working as a translator for the Green Beret A-Teams that were part of Task Force 31, nicknamed the “Desert Eagles,” which were hunting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.
Being a translator in a place like Kandahar conveys a distinct isolation; the high salary is coveted, but many feel that such work with the foreign soldiers is tainted.
Working with the Special Forces is doubly so.
S.
Special Forces have largely ignored those regulations.
All ODAs arm their ’terps,” one former Green Beret tells me.
Once trust is somewhat built, we train them and arm them.
We are doing hairy, dangerous jobs.
Kandahari carried an assault rifle and a pistol on missions.
For about $1,000 a month, he spent much of the next decade serving alongside America’s elite units.
He says he took a bullet in the calf and was severely concussed by a grenade during heavy fighting.
As many translators do, he took an American name: Jacob.
He first met the guys of ODA 3124 – the A-Team that came to Nerkh – in Forward Operation Base Cobra in a remote area of southern Afghanistan.
It was a very bad place, a lot of fighting, a lot of SF guys were killed or wounded,” Kandahari recalls.
On deployment in February 2010, the A-Team was responsible for calling in an airstrike on what turned out to be a convoy of civilians, killing 23 people, many of them women and children.
All ODAs arm their ’terps,” one former Green Beret says.
Once trust is somewhat built, we train them and arm them.
We are doing hairy, dangerous jobs.
Kandahari, like many Special Forces interpreters, forged close bonds with the Green Berets.
These interpreters start to get this mentality that they’re on the team,” the former Special Forces soldier tells me.
Kandahari was especially close, he says, to Jeff Batson, one of the senior sergeants on the team, and Michael Woods, a warrant officer.
Kandahari would serve a total of three tours with the A-Team.
Between deployments, he kept in touch with both men on Facebook.
In September 2012, he says that Batson – then ODA 3124’s team sergeant – called him and said that if Kandahari was ready to work, he should meet them in Kabul.
He said that we were going to a very bad place,” Kandahari recalls.
Kandahari showed up, and after a day they went to Nerkh.
There were a few familiar faces, such as Batson and Woods, but most of the team was new.
At first, the situation was fairly calm.
The A-Team tried to build a relationship with the locals in Nerkh by handing out radios and trinkets, but they wanted nothing to do with the Americans.
They’re all Hizb-e Islami motherfuckers there,” Kandahari says.
S.
Afghan special forces were engaged in fierce fighting against the Taliban.
Two Green Berets from their battalion had been killed.
One day, Kandahari, along with another interpreter named Ibrahim Hanifi and a small patrol led by Batson, encountered a large force of Taliban.
They killed several of them – Kandahari says he had brains all over his uniform from dragging their bodies – but more kept coming.
There were too many Taliban for us to fight, so we had to escape,” he says.
On the way back, Batson was shot in the leg by a sniper.
While under fire, Hanifi got a tourniquet onto Batson, and Kandahari drove him out to the medevac chopper.
I saved his life,” Kandahari says.
Batson’s injury must have been a traumatic event for the Green Berets.
On an A-Team, leadership is earned through experience and skill, not rank, which means that it is typically the team sergeant – usually a grizzled vet like Batson – who leads the missions.
While the highest-ranking member of ODA 3124 was technically the young Captain Egan, it was Batson who was in charge.
He’s our dad.
He is the oldest and wisest on the team,” the former Green Beret says of the role of a team sergeant.
If I watched him get shot – afterward, I would be very upset.
Kandahari says that after Batson was wounded and evacuated, the A-Team’s methods became much harsher.
After he left, it changed,” he says.
We weren’t arresting people according to reports anymore, just whether they looked suspicious.
He claims that David Kaiser, the A-Team’s intel sergeant, started conducting his own interrogations that only he, Egan and an American linguist were allowed to participate in.
Kandahari says he only arrested detainees and handed them over to Kaiser.
When I ask him about Sayed Mohammad, the man he had been caught on film beating, Kandahari claims he had left him with the Green Berets.
Later that night, he says, Hanifi approached him in their tent.
Hey, Jacob, come and take a look at this,” Hanifi said.
They went to a nearby storage tent.
Inside, there was a body bag with a corpse inside.
It’s Sayed Mohammad,” Kandahari says Hanifi told him.
S.
Special Forces.
Too many friends lost,” says one former Green Beret.
I tell Kandahari that multiple witnesses claim to have seen him participate in abusive interrogations, and that another had seen him execute Gul Rahim, but he flatly denies ever killing anyone.
He says that he had left Nerkh soon after Batson was injured, after quarreling with Kaiser.
The Americans were trying to frame him for their own crimes, he says.
They knew what was happening,” he says.
Of course they knew.
If someone does something on the base, everyone sees it.
S.
Special Forces at Fort Bragg, where ODA 3124 is based, they refuse to allow any of the members of the A-Team to be interviewed, citing the fact that there is an ongoing criminal investigation that opened in July.
Likewise, none of the team members I tracked down individually is willing to talk to me.
However, I manage to find another interpreter, who agrees to speak on the condition that I not identify him – I’ll call him Farooq.
He says he had worked with the A-Team before in FOB Cobra in Uruzgan too, but had arrived in Nerkh toward the end of the deployment, well after the incidents occurred.
Kandahari had left by then, as he was wanted by the Afghan government, but Farooq said that he had spoken with the other translators who had been present, and they blamed Kandahari for the killings.
Jacob liked to act like a gangster,” he says.
He actually enjoyed killing people.
Farooq tells me that Kandahari had killed prisoners before, during the A-Team’s deployment in Uruzgan.
Once, he says, a local mullah had been arrested by the team, and, after interrogation, they told Kandahari to release him.
But instead, Farooq claims, Kandahari walked him out in front of the FOB and shot him in the face.
Farooq was nearby and saw Kandahari standing over the body, pistol in hand.
I saw one,” he says.
He says Kandahari bragged to him about strangling one man with a rope, and beating another to death with a wooden club.
Farooq says that the A-Team knew that Kandahari was killing prisoners in Uruzgan.
He claims to have seen Batson scold Kandahari after he had executed the mullah.
But for the most part, he says, Kandahari was popular with the Green Berets because he was tough and fearless in battle, a reliable ally in Afghanistan’s dangerous terrain.
Hanifi points out that they had asked for him on every deployment.
Farooq says that he had also heard the trouble in Nerkh only started after Batson got shot and left – but that it was Kandahari who was the perpetrator.
Jeff was able to control that stuff,” he says.
The other translators at the base had told him that Kandahari had done all the killings without the knowledge of the team, after going out on his own and arresting people.
Indeed, that seems to have been the team’s story: Kandahari had acted alone.
But dozens of witnesses saw members of the A-Team, not just Kandahari, take the victims into custody.
Other military officials suggested to me that at least some of the allegations may have been the result of a campaign to discredit the Americans on behalf of the insurgents.
They may not be completely upfront about everything that occurred,” one American military official says.
The hardest thing on the enemy is the American Special Forces,” an Afghan official says.
It’s difficult to believe that dozens of illiterate Afghan villagers, scattered across Nerkh District, could have maintained an elaborate and consistent set of lies over a period of months.
N.
Red Cross, which have conducted extensive investigations into the incidents, and, according to officials familiar with the reports, have found the witnesses and their allegations credible.
N.
July said that it had “documented two incidents of torture, three incidents of killings and 10 incidents of forced disappearances during the months of November 2012 to February 2013 in the Maidan Shahr and Nerkh districts of Wardak province.
Victims and witnesses stated .
S.
The Afghan government also conducted multiple investigations into the allegations.
A senior Afghan official at the ministry of defense, who was privy to the confidential reports of a joint investigation with ISAF in March, says that he had initially been skeptical of the allegations, believing they were a plot cooked up by Hizb-e Islami in order to get rid of the Americans.
The hardest thing on the enemy is the American Special Forces,” the official says.
But after hearing from dozens of villagers, this Afghan official was convinced that the allegations were true – and that the crimes couldn’t simply be blamed on the translator.
There’s no doubt these people were taken by the Americans,” he says.
After my first conversation with Kandahari, I was able to obtain the names and photographs of most of ODA 3124, largely by cross-referencing information on Facebook.
I took head shots of ODA 3124 members and head shots of random, similar-looking American Special Forces soldiers found using Google Images, and constructed a photo array like the kind used by police investigators.
I did the same for the various interpreters who had been in Nerkh.
When I showed the photos to the witnesses in Nerkh, they consistently recognized, without prompting, members of ODA 3124 and their interpreters.
For example, Neamatullah, who claimed his two brothers were arrested and later found buried outside the base, correctly picked out six members of the A-Team.
When I show a group photo to Omar, the man who witnessed Gul Rahim’s execution by Kandahari, he identifies three members of the unit that he alleges were present during the murder and his subsequent torture.
When the joint Afghan government and ISAF investigation team visited Nerkh in March, members of the A-Team said that Kandahari had “escaped” on December 14th.
Yet locals accuse the Special Forces of serious abuses after that date.
I spoke to a man I’ll call Matin, who lives in the village of Omarkhel, which lies deep in insurgent-controlled areas of Nerkh Valley.
January 19th, the American Special Forces rounded up all the male villagers.
After viewing photos, Matin identifies two specific members of ODA 3124, who, along with a masked interpreter, allegedly took him and his son Shafiqullah, 33 years old and also a driver, into a nearby storage room and beat them savagely as they questioned them about bombs that had been found on a road nearby.
They told Matin to take them to his house, and as one Green Beret and the interpreter led him out of the storage room, leaving behind “a bearded American” and Matin’s son, he heard three gunshots.
The soldiers beat him again as they searched his house, until an Afghan army officer intervened on his behalf.
They were going to kill you, but I told them not to, so now go and see your son’s body,” Matin recalls him saying.
The Americans had found two IEDs nearby, and they took them to the back of Matin’s house and detonated them, partially destroying his home.
Then they left.
Matin says that he found his son in the neighbor’s pantry, with one gunshot wound in his head and two in his chest.
The incidents in Nerkh did not occur in a vacuum.

John Sifton, the Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.
Farooq, the interpreter who had previously served with ODA 3124 in Uruzgan, says that he routinely witnessed abusive interrogations during his time with the A-Team, involving physical beatings with fists, feet, cables and the use of devices similar to Tasers.
Of course they beat people, they had to,” he says.
Often, when we knew someone was guilty, they still refused to admit it or give us information, unless we beat them.
He says that the Special Forces soldiers were bitter about how detainees would often soon find themselves freed by the corrupt Afghan judicial system.
I don’t blame the team or Jacob for killing people.
The former Green Beret also says that he often witnessed the rough handling of detainees, which only the professionalism of his team’s leadership kept from escalating.
He’s concerned about the toll that the brutal pace of deployments has taken on the Special Forces community.
The 3rd Special Forces Group, which ODA 3124 was part of, has one of the fastest deployment tempos even for Green Berets.
Too many deployments with too many friends lost,” he says.
The numbers back up his point.
S.
The 66,000 members of the Special Operations Command comprise three percent of the military, yet they’ve suffered more than 20 percent of American combat deaths this year in Afghanistan.
And yet when the 2014 deadline for transition arrives and, as Obama put it in his State of the Union Address last February, “our war in Afghanistan will be over,” the quiet professionals of the Special Forces and the CIA will remain behind.
S.
CIA’s attitude toward working with Afghan allies who violate human rights is any indication, the fight in Afghanistan may get even dirtier.

ISAF, citing legal obligations, ceased transferring detainees into locations where there was credible evidence of torture.
The CIA and its Afghan militias – known as Counter Terrorism Pursuit Teams, or CTPTs – did not.
N.
Due to ongoing reports of abuse, ISAF has still not been able to certify those two locations, but joint operations with the CIA under OMEGA have since resumed.

NATO mission in Afghanistan stalls over negotiations and reverts to the “zero option” as it did in Iraq, the future of the country may well be one of covert warfare under the auspices of the CIA.

Last month, Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Afghanistan to meet with President Karzai and discuss the issue.
Karzai refused to be pinned down and has called for a Loya Jirga – a gathering of notables – to discuss the issue this month.
If the issue of jurisdiction cannot be resolved, then, unfortunately, there cannot be a bilateral security agreement,” Kerry said recently.
Whether it was Kandahari or his American employers who actually pulled the trigger in Nerkh is, in a certain sense, irrelevant.
Under the well-established legal principle of command responsibility, military officials who knowingly allow their subordinates to commit war crimes are themselves criminally responsible.
S.
Human Rights Watch’s Sifton.
The key question is: Who else knew?
As ISAF acknowledges, American military officials were aware of the allegations in November, at the beginning of the disappearances and killings.

S.
Army’s Criminal Investigation Command, which then opened an investigation on July 17th and is ongoing.
The most prudent course, in consideration of that new information, was to turn the matter over to military investigators for an overall review,” Crichton says.
S.
He had previously worked with coalition units as an interpreter, but was not a contract interpreter for coalition forces at the time of the alleged incidents,” Crichton says.
The SF guys tried to pick him up, but he got wind of it and went on the lam, and we lost contact with him,” an American official said of Kandahari in The New York Times in May.
And yet after Kandahari left COP Nerkh, and as the A-Team was pressured to account for the missing men, he kept chatting with Woods and other members of the team over Facebook.
Hahahah,” Kandahari wrote.
On April 29th, a month after the A-Team had been forced out of Nerkh by the Afghan government, and several weeks after the first bodies had been unearthed near the base, Woods posted a thank-you note on his Facebook page, naming several interpreters, including Kandahari and Hanifi.
The same day Kandahari commented: “same back to you and all 3124 Woody.
Both Woods and another A-Team member liked Kandahari’s comment.
The following day, Woods posted a photo of himself and Kandahari, standing shoulder to shoulder in COP Nerkh.
This is Matthieu Aikins’ first story for Rolling Stone He lives in Kabul.
For a long time, the Taj Guest House was about the only place you could get a beer in Jalalabad.
Afghanistan since the early days of the war.
When I showed up in the city in November 2011 to report on the propaganda efforts of a franchising Taliban, I found myself at the Taj.
There wasn’t much to the pub—just a bamboo-covered bar, a fireplace, a glass-fronted cooler with some Heineken stacked inside, and a few bottles of vodka and other spirits lined up under the red glow of a lamp.
Behind the Taj’s main building was a second villa with an imposing cluster of satellite dishes and antennae jutting from its roof.
The villa housed a small team of young expatriates, half a dozen or so women and men who generally kept to themselves.
Their apparent leader was a tall, broad-shouldered man who seemed always in a hurry.
Looking like a cross between a mountaineer and a mathematician, he had a salt-and-pepper beard and curly hair that hung down to his shoulders, and he favored a uniform of black polo shirts over tied-dyed tees.
His name was Dr.
Dave Warner.
War zones attract a lot of sketchy characters.
In Afghanistan and Iraq, where defense contractors have generally outnumbered soldiers on the ground, the cast of extras has been especially sprawling and inscrutable—security experts, mercenaries, aid workers, engineers, intelligence types, and consultants of every kind.
It was just a guess, but given the array on the roof, I took Warner and his team for spooks of some kind.
One night, while a fire was burning in the hearth at the Taj, I found Warner sitting at the bar, staring at his laptop through small, square glasses.
I grabbed a beer and struck up a conversation, looking over his shoulder as a digital animation twirled across his screen—rings of gold, purple, and blue rotating over a satellite image of the city of Jalalabad.
To my surprise, he was happy to explain.
Warner said, zooming in and pointing at a small doughnut shape spinning around a larger figure.
What we were looking at was a data-visualization tool he had created, called Antz.
The patterns on the screen reflected actual information from the environs in Jalalabad—records of attacks on coalition forces, funding and logistical data for various reconstruction projects, the movements of people.
Warner believed the program was a step toward better intelligence analysis.
But he made a point of telling me that none of the information on the screen was classified.
He had built the model entirely from freely available data that he and his team had harvested from the city.
I was at best half right in my guess about Warner’s occupation.
S.
The most valuable information in a conflict or disaster zone, he said, was information that could be shared with everybody.
The term radical inclusion stopped me.
I recognized it from the summer of 1998, when I had gone to Burning Man , the hedonistic-fire-worshipper-art-festival that occurs every summer in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert.
When I mentioned this, Warner’s eyes lit up.
He dug into his T-shirt and pulled out a shining Burning Man medallion.
Dude,” he said, grinning in the firelight.
WARNER’S ENTIRE TEAM—WHICH he called, in all seriousness, the Synergy Strike Force—had just attended Burning Man that summer.
He himself had been attending annually since 2002.
And the bar, it turned out, was his bar.
Warner held the lease on the Taj, and he ran it with the help of an Afghan man, a former shepherd turned beekeeper turned tobacconist turned pool cleaner turned guesthouse manager named Mehrab.
By design, the Taj sat “outside the wire,” beyond the security perimeter of the nearby coalition airfield.
It was not only a place to drink and flop but also a kind of grand social experiment—an outpost of the Burning Man ethos in the Afghan desert.
What Warner meant when he called the Taj a “Burner bar” was that it operated, in part, according to a barter system.
One of the standing rules at the guesthouse was that any expat could exchange information for booze.
In a war zone where so many different agencies, companies, and contractors passed like wary ships in the night, one of the biggest problems was that no one could coordinate knowledge.
No one, that is, except maybe a bartender.
Under the banner of “Beer for Data,” Warner had turned the Taj into a major clearinghouse for information in Jalalabad.
It accumulated by the terabyte on his hard drives: construction plans, hydrology surveys, health-clinic locations, election polling sites, names of farmers, number of trees on their farms, number of acres.
What Warner collected he then passed on to the United Nations, the Pentagon, and anyone else who asked for it.
Warner let on that there was a lot more to tell, and that he was making a trip into the field a couple days later.
But he offered no invitation, and I went to bed, leaving him at his laptop.
And that was how I met Dr.
S.
Army drill instructor, self-avowed “hippie doctor,” PhD neuroscientist, technotopian idealist, dedicated Burner, dabbler in psychedelics, insatiable meddler, and  weirdest of all  defense contractor.
Unlike the guys who had come to the war mainly for the hazard pay, Warner seemed genuinely bent on something far grander—redeeming the debacle of Afghanistan through the gospel of open information.
However romantic that gospel sounded, by this point in the war it was clear there was plenty that needed redeeming.
Despite rosy assessments from American politicians and diplomats, Afghanistan was a much less welcoming place in 2011 than it had been on my first visit, five years earlier.
In private courtyards, in markets and mosques, and in insurgent enclaves around the country, almost everyone, it seemed, was impatiently waiting for the Americans to leave.
The international forces that had been so successful in ousting the Taliban at the outset of the military campaign had been flummoxed by years of grinding insurgency and the persistence of Afghanistan’s complexities—its rules and rites, traditions and customs.
Added to all that was a culture of secrecy and mistrust between military units and the development agencies, both international and local, that had rushed into the power gaps left by the Taliban rout.
The war effort, in short, was sophisticated when it came to deploying lethal hardware like drones, but clumsy in just about every other way.
A few people in the upper echelons of the command structure were painfully aware of this.
Warner knew because he had their ear.
He had connections in the Defense Intelligence Agency , the CIA , the Army Special Forces , and the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
He also knew what an unlikely figure he cut—a Burner among bureaucrats.
When I asked him later why the Department of Defense had turned to him, he shook his head and laughed.
IN THE EARLY MORNING two days later, I heard a knock on my door, followed by Warner’s voice asking me if I could be ready to leave in five minutes.
After I had scrambled into my clothes, we piled into a Toyota Corolla and headed out of town, leaving the jammed streets behind and speeding into the empty desert.
This was more than a little unnerving.
S.
You’re crammed into a plated Humvee in an armed convoy, bundled up in heavy body armor, twitchy with anticipation.
Warner and I had no weapons and no armor, and were at best thinly disguised by the Afghan clothes, scarves, and hats we wore.
As we pulled away from the guesthouse, I took a deep breath.
Dr.
Warner told me he had been hired—through a contracting company, which was hired in turn by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  better known as DARPA, or the folks who brought you the Internet —to research ways of crowdsourcing information from Afghans.
Because most Afghans lack computers and are at best semiliterate, Warner began with an ingeniously low-tech approach.
The Synergy Strike Force enlisted a local radio station to broadcast questions to its audience and ask them to respond via text message—questions like Who’s your favorite cricket player?
The team also solicited texts that might deliver more valuable information on, say, agricultural markets—What’s the price of mutton, gasoline, or milk today?
But Warner didn’t stop there.
One of the destinations on our trip was a village about 30 miles outside Jalalabad.
There Warner led me inside a compound, up a flight of stairs, and into a cramped room with bare concrete walls, where a group of boys were hunched over a bank of dusty Dell computers.
They were drawing Afghan flags with Microsoft Paint.
On the roof, two banks of solar panels powered the computers, supplemented by a gas-powered generator for rare cloudy days.
Using various pots of money, Warner had built dozens of these solar-powered computer labs around the province.
Some, like this one, didn’t have an Internet connection—at least not yet—and were, in Warner’s mind, just stepping stones to the computer literacy that would one day make these kids potential sources of crowdsourced information.
Other computer labs, closer to town, had Internet pumped in from the antennae and satellite dishes on the roof of the Taj.
In those labs, Warner and his team were teaching Afghans how to use OpenStreetMap , a Web-based platform that allows users to add fine-grained local information to existing satellite maps.
Warner was doing it on the cheap—no security details, no armored vehicles—stretching his DARPA funding and his own bank account fairly far.
But it wasn’t just about power or the Web.
Warner sees technology on a continuum that stretches all the way down to the most basic tools.
A few hundred yards away, in the middle of a sunbaked boulder field, clusters of kids sat on the ground, chanting the alphabet in front of blackboards that Warner had purchased for them.
Younger children sat in circles, leaning over notepads: a classroom in the sun.
A few tents had been erected nearby: shade for when the heat became unbearable.
As the children chimed out their letters, a few local elders came over to Warner  they knew him simply as an “American businessman” interested in helping them  and showed him a well they had recently dug with his support.
Then they guided us to a mat laid out on the ground.
Over tall glasses of water and plates of bananas and shiny red apples, Warner and a young Afghan member of the Synergy Strike Force sat with the men as they explained what more they might need—a schoolhouse with walls, an animal clinic, electricity, bridges, irrigation ditches, a cow so they wouldn’t have to buy milk every day, more security, less war.
Warner saw this school as the beginning of a “cyber node,” a place that could eventually be wired up, along with other primitive schools he was scouting on the Pakistan border.
To him it seemed obvious—information about the world would bring Afghans out of isolation.
Dave’s work also had the effect, it so happened, of winning hearts and minds in a battle zone.
This patch of desert was routinely crossed by insurgents who slipped out of the mountains of Pakistan to make mischief in the remote villages of Nangarhar Province.
I was just beginning to get used to his way of talking, which alternated between turgid military jargon and gonzo flights of fancy.
Ultimately, what he wanted to do was help the Department of Defense and all its scattered parts—a hulking war apparatus he derisively called “The Machine”—help itself.
I’ve foolishly created my own counterinsurgency,” he said.
I SPENT THE NEXT few days back at the Taj getting to know the Synergy Strike Force—essentially a loose-knit collective of volunteers and contractors who followed Dr.
Dave.
The name may have been whimsical, but it wasn’t a joke.
Warner showed me a military-style patch he’d designed himself, displaying a white- winged, faceless angel holding a caduceus in one hand, a lightning bolt in the other, and the Earth cradled between the two.
Three members of the group were living at the Taj full-time: Jennifer Gold, 26, a National Guard intelligence analyst who had decided to stay in Afghanistan after her deployment ended; Rachel Robb, 27, a human-rights advocate with experience mainly in South America; and her husband, Juan Rodriguez, 28, a photographer from Colombia.
Others made occasional visits, including a pink-haired futurist from San Francisco.
As far as I could tell, being part of the group basically entailed living at the Taj, finding problems, and fixing them.
This is the whole idea behind the Synergy Strike Force—don’t come here with a project that you’re going to try to impose on people,” Robb told me one afternoon in the Taj’s grassy courtyard.
In 2009, the group had helped set up a system to crowdsource reports of election-rules violations via text messages from all over the country.
And during my visit, Gold, Robb, and Rodriguez were wrapping up a project in which they used SMS texts to reach midwives in far-flung Kunar province to solicit medical information about mothers and their newborns.
The group was also engaged in various maker-ish side projects worthy of Burning Man.
Gold was busy building a methane generator from PVC pipe and an old oil drum.
The design, popular among self-sufficiency buffs on the Internet, allows you to filter the gasses that come off human waste into pure methane, which can be used as a fuel source.
No matter what they did, Warner encouraged the group to rely on the local connections he had built up over the years, and to keep their distance from the “battle rattle” of the military—the spectacle of nervous, heavily armed soldiers trying to interface with an equally nervous, unarmed population.
We’re able to approach people because we aren’t carrying all this armor and weapons,” Robb said.
Gold, who had come away disillusioned after serving a tour in Iraq, knew all too well how little could be accomplished from a fortified position behind the wire.
You can’t commute to the war,” she said as we sat in the courtyard, taking a break from her methane generator.
NOT SURPRISINGLY DR.
DAVE’S own road to war was strange and circuitous.
A teenage runaway from a Seventh-day Adventist family in Central California, Warner enlisted in the army in 1980, at age 19.
He served as a TOW-missile gunner and drill sergeant before finding his way to college and then medical school.
Somewhere along the way he started experimenting with LSD and steeping himself in the tech world.
He was particularly interested in finding ways to use virtual reality—then much discussed in military circles as a way to train soldiers—for non-military ends.
In 1994, while Warner was still completing medical school at Loma Linda University , he started working with a seven-year-old patient named Ashley Hughes.
Hughes had been paralyzed since birth, but she had motor function in her face—she could wiggle her cheeks, wink an eye, raise an eyebrow.
With Warner’s help, she learned to play computer games and drive a remote-control vehicle using only her facial movements, with sensors translating her muscle twitches into digital commands.
Later, by outfitting a mannequin’s head with small cameras for eyes and microphones for ears, and then connecting those inputs to a pair of 3-D goggles and a set of earphones, Warner gave Hughes—who had never swum in a swimming pool, climbed a tree, or looked over her backyard fence—the virtual experience of doing all those things.
Warner’s work with Hughes and other patients landed him on World News Tonight With Peter Jennings , and in the pages of The New York Times.
It also caught the attention of a few people at DARPA, who approached Warner about doing some work for them.
He took the research he’d done on sensors and started designing gloves that could control robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other machines.
Bit by bit, however, Warner was becoming less interested in virtual reality or physiology per se, and more interested in the underlying information itself—whether it was the signals being transmitted from the cheek muscles of a little girl with a disability, or spatial models of vendors moving around an Afghan market.
I have a philosophy that I can alter outcomes with information,” Warner told me.
I started this idea in med school.
And he wasn’t the only person contemplating the new powers of information.
He began forging friendships with like-minded folks inside the defense, intelligence, and emergency-response communities—all of them looking for ways to use nascent information technologies to help them do their jobs amid natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or wars.
N.
2004, the tsunami-struck coast of Indonesia.
In each, he found that poor cooperation and communication were epidemic among the major players.
Around 2000, he started talking with a man named Linton Wells, an information specialist then in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
By 2006, Wells was trying to figure out how to stimulate more interaction between military and civilian entities in Afghanistan.
This had become a huge problem there, as it had in Iraq—both were war zones where international forces and aid agencies mixed in unprecedentedly complex ways.
One problem was that people under different charters or chains of command weren’t sharing even unclassified information.
So Wells asked Warner to go to Afghanistan and see whether he could come up with some ideas.
N.
Mission.
Thursday nights, the end of the Afghan workweek and the eve of the Muslim Sabbath, were particularly popular with the clientele.
On one such evening at the Taj, over drinks with the myriad characters at the bar, Warner learned more about the war than he had at any of the official meetings he’d been to that week.
A year later, he brought a computer and a hard drive to the bar and posted a sign saying he’d buy a beer for anyone who brought in information.
And thus “Beer for Data” was born.
He took over the Taj and its bar in May 2009.
It was just the kind of thing his patrons in the military wanted to see.
Eric Rasmussen, one of Warner’s early sponsors at DARPA, has come away similarly awed by the doctor’s capacities.
I was taught by multiple Nobel Prize winners, and Dave is the equal of any of them in intelligence,” Rasmussen told me.
Warner has been “trendsetting for a number of very forward-thinking organizations, like the Strategic Studies Group for the Chief of Naval Operations, like DARPA, like the Office of Naval Research,” among others.
He has shaped curriculum for the Marine Corps.
He has influenced curriculum for National Defense University.
What’s more, he has done it all without a security clearance.
OF COURSE, DAVE WARNER is not the first dreamer the military has ever turned to for help.
Back in 2011, when I first met Warner and the Synergy Strike Force, I was immediately reminded of the book The Men Who Stare at Goats , by Jon Ronson, and its descriptions of the First Earth Battalion.
In the 1970s, the Pentagon decided it needed a new bag of tools to fight future wars.
It also needed to recover from its defeat in Vietnam.
Morale in the military was dreadful, and the war machine seemed broken.
To make matters worse, intelligence reports suggested that the People’s Republic of China had figured out a way to endow a few thousand children with powers of clairvoyance, psychokinesis, telepathy, and X-ray vision.
And so, in 1977, a Pentagon working group on human potential handed a young lieutenant colonel named Jim Channon an assignment: Search the New Age enclaves that were then sprouting in California for possible military applications, and find the outer limits of human potential.
Channon drew up a field manual, published by the Army in 1979, for something he called the First Earth Battalion.
The manual included diagrams of chakras and the power of dreams.
The more dreams you have, the more you can create for yourself the future you desire,” the manual advises.
Channon wanted to build a kind of super soldier, a warrior monk who could unlock psychic powers and overwhelm an enemy with little more than a kind gaze.
Love and synergy, it so happens, were the core purported strengths of such a soldier.
Synergy is possible when every soldier brings his or her individual best to the group task,” Channon wrote.
It is multiplied in strength again if that soldier truly loves the other members of the unit.
His First Earth soldiers would employ “battle tuning” through a daily yoga cat stretch, followed by a primal scream and leap.
Their performance-enhancing regimen would include ginseng, amphetamines, rock and roll, and prayers to Mother Earth.
Ethical combat” and “benevolent weapons”—to include “indigenous music and words of peace,” symbolic flowers, and animals—would take on a changing world of conflict.
If in fact we want to have a heaven on earth, then a class of angels should come forth and begin the work,” Channon wrote.
Open your heart.
There were no amphetamines or primal screams at the Taj—none that I witnessed, at least—but the military’s dalliance with the Synergy Strike Force came from a similar spirit, the end-of-the-road experimentation that goes on when nothing seems to be going right.
Sooner or later, the most esoteric, farthest-out ideas of an era are going to get thrown at the most intractable, most-monumental bureaucratic mistakes.
Where Channon’s First Earth Battalion had dredged the New Age zeitgeist for military insights, the Synergy Strike Force was drawing from today’s answer to the human-potential movement—the technology-soaked, DIY-happy, crowdsource-everything ethos of Burning Man and the more exuberant corners of Silicon Valley.
If you look closely at the angel on the Synergy Strike Force patch, you can see around its neck the same symbol that Warner was wearing the night I met him.
FOUR MONTHS AFTER I left Afghanistan, I stayed in fairly close touch with Warner and the Synergy Strike Force, keeping tabs on their projects and, in my heart of hearts, rooting for them.
For a while I even considered volunteering at the Taj—to do what, I wasn’t sure.
But the optimism was infectious.
It was not, however, enough to turn the tide in Afghanistan.
S.
Bagram Air Base collected a bunch of library books that Taliban prisoners had been using to pass messages to one another.
As part of the disposal process, the soldiers burned them.
The trouble was that some of the books were Korans.
When Afghan forces on the base reported the desecration, riots erupted across the country.
S.
Ministry of Interior.
Seven more American soldiers were wounded in a grenade attack.
The very problems the Synergy Strike Force sought to counteract—the disconnect between the Machine and the Afghans, the chronic distrust—had reached a tipping point.
The violence grew so bad that Robb, Rodriguez, and Gold fled the country.
The Taj was left in the able hands of Mehrab, the guesthouse’s Afghan manager.
Looking for a place to hunker down, the three expats decamped to Reno, of all places, to stay with a friend of Warner’s and continue their work remotely.
I was living in Southern California at the time, so I drove up to see them.
They were busy designing a project that would deliver neonatal advice to women in the Afghan countryside via robocalls.
Rachel Robb tried to put a good face on their retreat from Jalalabad.
We’re definitely going back to Afghanistan.
We haven’t left for good.
BUT THINGS DIDN’T SETTLE down.
Not even close.
On August 11, 2012, two gunmen on motorcycles shot and killed Mehrab as he sat in his car.
The apparent assassination shook the team; nobody knew whether Mehrab had been killed for his work with the Synergy Strike Force  connecting women to the Internet was not a popular idea with everyone in the province  or whether some local grievance had been to blame.
Around the same time, the defense establishment’s enthusiasm for Warner vanished along with its funding.
In September of last year, Warner wrote via email that he was “not getting love from the Machine” for a plan to build something he called the “Cyber Pass”—an extension of his solar-powered Internet schemes focused on areas along the Pakistan border.
He was keeping the Taj afloat with his retirement savings and somehow managing to keep wiring a few more schools.
He was still making occasional trips to Jalalabad.
But the Synergy Strike Force had dissipated, its members moving on to other projects.
Last summer at Burning Man, members of the team gathered once again, and Warner invited me to join them.
So I headed out to the Black Rock Desert and pitched a small tent next to Warner’s giant RV.
He came out of nowhere, from the dust and the wind, as I was struggling with some rigging for a tarp.
He was drinking a beer, wearing a tied-dyed shirt and cutoff jean shorts, with a tie-dyed bandana on his head and another around his neck.
The temple is a structure that gets built every year at Burning Man.
Burners go there to mourn for whomever they have lost; we were going to mourn for Mehrab.
I followed Warner out onto the desert playa, where in the distance the giant wooden statue of “The Man” waited to be burned at the end of the festival.
We walked past a 20-foot-tall wooden statue of the word ego inset with trophies, past a field of plastic sunflowers, past men and women in various states of undress and inebriation.
Warner took huge strides.
On the far side of the wide, flat, dusty playa stood the temple, a large structure reminiscent of an Asian pagoda, made of thin, filigreed wood panels.
On the walls, people had scribbled notes both personal and universal—“I Miss You,” “Humanity Will Prevail”—and incense wafted through the interior.
Warner gathered with other members of the Synergy Strike Force.
He nailed a pakul hat to the wall, hung an Afghan scarf around it, and added a Synergy Strike Force patch.
Around us, Burners wept and prayed.
And at the end of the festival, the temple was burned to the ground, with everything in it.

Ann Jones is a journalist, photographer  Getty Images , and the author of eight books of nonfiction, including Women Who Kill, Next Time She’ll Be Dead, Kabul in Winter, and War Is Not Over When It’s Over.
She has reported on the impact of war in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, and embedded with American forces in Afghanistan.
Her new book is They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return from America s Wars—The Untold Story  Haymarket Books .
JAISAL NOOR, TRNN PRODUCER: Welcome to The Real News Network.
I m Jaisal Noor in Baltimore.
Veterans Day special with journalist Ann Jones.
She s the author of the new book They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return from America s War--The Untold Story.
S.
Afghanistan and our military presence around the world in dozens of countries.
S.
S.
What s your response, especially based on the time you spent in Afghanistan?
Are we there to defend our freedom, to defend our interest?
ANN JONES, JOURNALIST, PHOTOJOURNALIST, AUTHOR: No.
I mean, this is ridiculous.
Nobody can believe that at this point, and certainly nobody believes that about the war in Iraq.
S.
This is 1 percent or less of the American population that s affected, that goes to perform these wars.
This is the 1 percent on the bottom that loses from these wars, as opposed to 1 percent on the top that s profiting from from these wars.
But, you know, the founding fathers, who get so much credit for telling us all sorts of things, told us something about a standing army that we have completely forgotten and that none of these conservatives so eager to go to war remember, and that is they issued very strong warnings against having a standing army, and they predicted precisely what has happened.
If you have an army of volunteers, a standing army, then the executive, especially one who likes to dress up in military uniforms and call himself commander-in-chief, gets to do pretty much whatever he and his pals in government choose to do with that military.
And I think as these wars have gone on and on, more and more Americans realize that the military has been severely misused by civilian leaders, and by some of the military leaders as well, although many, to their credit, resigned as a matter of conscience or took early retirement from the military rather than participate in what they saw going on.
So to argue that we need these people in the military and they re protecting our freedoms is to abrogate our own responsibility as citizens to see what--to participate in these decisions and to take responsibility for what goes on.
And that the American public has failed to do.
We ve let those kids go off and fight these battles, with disastrous results for them and for their families, and for us, who are going to go on paying the costs of their care for the rest of their lives.
NOOR: So I think you almost unfairly, though, foot the blame on conservatives when it s, you know, liberals and Democrats that in many cases have been as supportive of these wars.
And, you know, under the Obama administration, our war effort in Afghanistan was escalated for years.
JONES: Yes.
That s certainly true.
And I take your point.
And I don t mean to pin the blame entirely on conservatives.
I think there s plenty of responsibility to go around among the whole population, actually, who have ignored, to a large extent, what goes on in our wars or who have taken the kind of easy out of waving a flag at the airport or putting a flag on their car or tying yellow ribbons around trees.
You know, that doesn t do it, really.
That may make civilians feel good, but it doesn t do anything for our military.
NOOR: And I wanted to jump back to the discussion we were having about the human toll of this war.
And, you know, so the discussion of the impact on soldiers, I think that s been getting more attention over the past several years, but it s rarely talked about.
What s rarely talked about is the impact on the medical staff that treat these soldiers, and that s something you spent some serious time documenting.
Can you talk about what the impact is for nurses and for doctors and other people who are responsible for treating the soldiers that are injured in battle?
JONES: Well, you re right.
We hear practically nothing about that, so that I was very surprised when I started interviewing the medical staff at the field hospitals and at Bagram base.
And I was talking to highly skilled professionals.
S.
And they said, every one of them, that they were completely unprepared for the kinds of injuries they were called upon to treat as a result of these wars.
But she said even that can t touch the kind of injuries we see here.
And the doctors, the surgeons were called upon to work on these cases day in, day out for a six-months tour of duty.
And I think it was a rare doctor who spoke to me without at some point breaking down in the course of our interviews.
And then they would all apologize that they were just overtired, they were coming to the end of their tour.
But they were all devastated by the work that they had been required to do and that they were still doing on a daily basis.
And just from the time that I visited these hospitals and observed the kinds of work that they were doing, I understood very well how difficult it was for them to continue to do this day after day after day.
It s a terrible, it s a terrible responsibility.
And the question that haunted all of the surgeons was when we patch these kids up, when we save their lives and we send them on and they finally wake up in Washington or Bethesda or someplace else in the States and realize that they re missing two, three, or four of their limbs, are they really going to be glad to be alive?
Is it right that we work so hard to save them, and are they going to feel any kind of pleasure in having their lives saved?
And of course the word came back, oh, yes, they re all very glad you saved their lives, they re very happy to be alive.
But privately, nurses and doctors told me differently in many cases.
And if you try to imagine yourself in that situation waking up without your arms and legs, I think it s understandable that many are not consistently glad to still be alive.
NOOR: Ann Jones, we re going to wrap up this second part of our discussion.
In our third part, we re going to talk about the prescription drugs that so many soldiers are on, both active duty and veterans, as they deal with the trauma of what they ve experienced and what they ve seen in battle.
Thank you so much for joining us.
JONES: Thank you.
NOOR: And thank you for joining us on The Real News Network.

Afghanistan, has identified potentially billions of dollars wasted in Afghanistan, including donation of planes the local government doesn t need or can t use, weapons that disappear as soon as they re handed over and and construction of brand new buildings that are basically firetraps.
In a steady stream of audit reports, Sopko s office of Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, has spotlighted seemingly endless waste in the war-torn nation.
S.
Some 285 buildings, including barracks, medical clinics and even fire stations built by the Army are lined with substandard spray insulation so prone to ignition that they don t meet international building codes.
The Pentagon has little oversight over hundreds of thousands of small arms turned over to the Afghan army, and many have disappeared altogether.
In addition to the recent flurry of reports, SIGAR has criticized the spending of $34 million to build Camp Leatherneck in the Washir District of Afghanistan, a 64,000-square-foot facility that was never used and sits empty to this day.

Dunlap said.
Sopko is not shy about lacing his numbers-heavy audits with pointed criticism and recommendations.
In his report earlier this month on turning over two C-130 Hercules transport planes, he methodically noted that the Afghan air force had already proven unable to adequately maintain a pair it previously received.
Experts including Mark Jacobson, a fellow with the Truman National Security Project who also served on NATO’s International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, say Sopko gets it.

Sopko said he is fighting a culture in which neither Afghanistan s nor America s interests are well served.

Not surprisingly, thousands of weapons were found to be missing during inventory inspections at supply depots.
It also reveals that the Pentagon continues to send weapons -- even though the Afghans have 100,000 more than they need.

Half a world away Australians are serving their country by building another.
The war in Afghanistan and operations in the Middle East have engaged thousands of Australian men and women, both military and civilian, for over a decade.
They have built schools, roads, and hospitals.
They have mentored the fledgling army of a new, democratic nation.
They have engaged in fierce fighting and have demonstrated bravery and dedication beyond compare.
On 11 September 2001, Australians felt outrage at al Qaeda’s attack on the United States.
A year later, the devastating Bali bombings in Indonesia again brought home the threat of global terrorism.
Some of those who planned the bombings had trained in Afghanistan.
Australians were killed in both attacks.
Australia joined the United States and its allies across the world to take a stand against this threat.
Afghanistan, a land contested by armies for centuries, became the focus of international efforts to contain terrorism.
The mission has evolved over the past decade in what is called the Middle East Area of Operations  MEAO .
From counter-insurgency, through reconstruction, to mentoring, Australians have been working to create a democratic and stable Afghan nation.
This mission aims to assist the people of Afghanistan, but also to promote the security of the region, diminish the influence of terrorist groups, and create a safer global environment.
Afghanistan and the Middle East are now indelibly linked to Australia’s national story.
Australia’s mission is clear: to combat international terrorism, to help stabilise Afghanistan, and to support Australia’s international alliances.
Yet a mission statement cannot capture the challenges, the successes, and the comradeship of the Australian men and women who pursue it.
Nor the joys and heartbreaks, or the loneliness and the dedication of those who wait at home.
Some of these experiences, set against the powerful imagery of a modern war, are told in this exhibition.
Over time, the display will change and evolve as more veterans share their stories.

On the rare occasions when servicemen are held to account, the report found that the compromised military justice system seldom secured justice for the victims of enforced disappearances, killings, and abuse that included torture.
President Obama has admitted that ‘we tortured’ people in the past—but this is not the Bush administration, this is torture happening under Obama,” said Joanne Mariner, the author of the report.
While torture and other abuses by the CIA and the military were sanctioned by the Bush administration, Obama entered office vowing to end such practices.
A survivor of one of the most egregious assaults on civilians detailed in the report told The Daily Beast he had been forced to listen to the last gasps and sobs of his dying daughter, who was seven months pregnant, while the Americans threatened to kill anyone who moved.
She was calling out for help, maybe she wanted to share her last words before she left us forever,” said Muhammad Tahir, a civil servant.

The report, titled “Left in the Dark,” includes detailed investigations of 10 incidents in which at least 140 civilians, including 50 children, were killed in dubious circumstances.

The Department of Defense does not permit its personnel to engage in acts of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of any person in its custody,” said Maj.
Bradlee Avots.
According to the Amnesty report, a Special Forces unit had raided the house on February 12, 2010.
Five people were killed, some by sniper fire, some at closer range.
When they understood they had hit the wrong place, they started pulling out the bullets from the dead bodies with their hands and their knives,” Tahir recalled.
The day after the assault, ISAF announced that forces had stumbled upon the dead women after a firefight with insurgents.
In the following days they would go on to brief the press with a series of lurid but inaccurate stories suggesting that there was evidence of honor killings or execution-style murders.
The immediate effort to cover up what had been done suggested that they realized it was a crime,” said Mariner.
Amnesty says Tahir’s family is just one of thousands who have waited in vain for justice for their missing, dead, or severely injured loved ones.
S.
Among the most disturbing allegations are claims of forcible disappearance, torture, and extrajudicial killings carried out by a rogue unit in Wardak province from the fall of 2012.
We interviewed a former detainee that had a really horrific story of just raw torture,” Mariner said.
S.
On the first night,” he said, “the Americans told me they were going to try 14 different types of torture on me.
He said he suffered electric shocks, beatings, simulated drowning, hanging from the ceiling, partial burial in freezing conditions, and the extraordinary and degrading torment of having a length of string tied tightly around his penis.
They left the string around my penis for four days.
My abdomen was bulging.
I wasn’t able to pee for those four days,” he said.
He was lucky.
He says half of the men he was incarcerated with did not survive the ordeal, and he claims to have watched one man be beaten to death by a redheaded American commando.
S.
There were people who were disappeared as late as February” in 2013, said Mariner.
Amnesty says relying on an internal justice system is not conducive to thorough investigations of alleged crimes; the commanders whose duty it would be to report incidents may be implicated, and there is a heavy reliance on the word of the accused and their colleagues rather than independent witnesses.
The military insists that civilian deaths are investigated whenever allegations of unlawful killing are made.
S.
Investigation results can and have previously led to both criminal convictions, as well as adverse administrative actions,” said Avots.
We lost five members of the family and about 20 kids became orphans,” he said, in a tearful phone interview.

A new report has found the war on drugs in Afghanistan remains colossally expensive, largely ineffective and likely to get worse.
S.
Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.
In a damning report released Tuesday, the special inspector general, Justin F.
Sopko, writes that â€œdespite spending over $7 billion to combat opium poppy cultivation and to develop the Afghan governmentâ€™s counternarcotics capacity, opium poppy cultivation levels in Afghanistan hit an all-time high in 2013,â€� hitting 209,000 hectares, surpassing the prior, 2007 peak of 193,000 hectares.
Sopko adds that the number should continue to rise thanks to deteriorating security in rural Afghanistan and weak eradication efforts.
Though the figures it reports are jarring, the inspector general’sÂ investigation highlights drug policy failures in Afghanistan that have been consistently documented for years.
Indeed, Sopko himself has been raising concerns over the failing drug war in Afghanistan for some time.
In the opinion of almost everyone I spoke with, the situation in Afghanistan is dire with little prospect for improvement in 2014 or beyond,â€� Sopko told the lawmakers.

The Soviet war in Afghanistan was a war initially fought between the forces of the Afghanistan government and foreign mercenaries.
The entry of the Soviet Union into the country caused an immediate increase in the presence of foreign mercenaries.
Massive military campaigns against foreign mercenaries, who blend in with the local population, caused extensive destruction of local infrastructure and death, causing the local population to side with the foreign mercenaries.
This change, among the local population, caused a loss of support for the Soviet military presence, creating nation-wide resistance, and the eventual quagmire.
The war began in December 1979, and lasted until February 1989.
About 15,000 Soviet soldiers were killed, and about 35,000 were wounded.
About one million Afghan civilians were killed.
The anti-government forces had support from many countries, mainly the United States and Pakistan .
The war started when the Soviet Union sent its 40th Army to fight in Afghanistan.
They began to reach Afghanistan from 25 December 1979 .
The fighting continued for about ten years.
Then, from 15 May 1988 , the Soviet troops started to leave Afghanistan.
This continued until 2 February 1989 .
On 15 February 1989 , the Soviet Union announced that all its troops had left Afghanistan.
On 22 December 1979 , Soviet advisors to the Army of Afghanistan took many steps.
They stopped all telecommunication links in Kabul .
No message could come inside the city, or go outside the city.
Troops of the Soviet Air force also reached Kabul.

On 27 December 1979 , about 700 Soviet troops took over major government and military buildings at Kabul.
The troops wore uniforms similar to the army of Afghanistan.
At 7:00 pm, the Soviet troops destroyed Kabul s communication.
This stopped all communication among Afghan troops.
At 7:15 pm, Soviet troops entered Tajbeg Palace.
By morning of 28 December , the first part of the military action was over.
Amin and his two sons were killed in the fighting by this time.
The Soviets announced freedom of Afghanistan from the rule of President Amin.
An announcement came from the Kabul radio station about the killing of Hafizullah Amin.
The Pro-Soviet Afghan Revolutionary Central Committee  ARCC  took the responsibility for this killing.
Then, the ARCC chose Babrak Karmal as the head of government of Afghanistan.
He asked the Soviet Union for military assistance.
The government of Afghanistan asked the Soviet Union many times to send troops.
Despite the Soviet Union s treaty with Afghanistan to assist, and fearing a Vietnam-style quagmire, the Soviet Union resisted, instead telling the Afghanistan government to reach a compromise with the foreign mercenaries.
As the situation deteriorated between the Afghanistan government and foreign merecenaries, the Soviet Union initially responded with only intelligence and advisors.
Pakistan thought that the Soviet war in Afghanistan was also a threat to it.
Through its intelligence agency, the ISI, it also started its active support to Afghans fighting the Soviet troops.
The Soviet war in Afghanistan badly affected the rule of Communist Party.
Many thought that the war was against Islam.
This created strong feelings among the Muslim population of Central Asian Soviet Republics.
The Soviet army was really in very low spirits or   morale   because they were unable to control the people and were treated only as invaders everywhere they went.
Andrei Sakharov openly said the action of Soviet Army in Afghanistan was wrong.
Over 15,000 Soviet troops got killed in Afghanistan from 1979 until 1989.
In the war, the Soviet Army also lost hundreds of aircraft, and billions worth of other military machines.
Around a million Afghan men, women and children died in the war.
Even after the Soviet Army left Afghanistan, civil war continued in Afghanistan.
For about three years, the Communist government of Najibullah couldn t defend itself from the mujaheddin forces opposing it.
Many groups had arisen within the government itself, and some of them supported the mujaheddin forces.
In March 1992, General Abdul Rashid Dostam and his Uzbek militia stopped supporting the Najibullah’s government.
Soon, mujaheddin forces won Kabul and started to rule most parts of Afghanistan.
During this war lasting for about ten years, Afghanistan s economy suffered badly.
5% per year between 1978 and 1990.
The Soviets also tried to bring commercial and industrial activities under state control.
This also had a bad effect on the economy.
With the break-up of the Soviet Union in many countries, Afghanistan’s traditional trade also suffered.

WASHINGTON  AP  — If President Barack Obama were to decide to leave no military advisory force in Afghanistan next year, would Afghan security unravel to the point of enabling a civil war, a Taliban takeover and a return of al-Qaida in such numbers as to pose a 9 11-type threat?
That is the question at the core of the debate over Obama s next move in a long-running standoff with the Afghans over a postwar presence.
A look at the debate and the arguments behind it.
Q: Hasn t Obama said the war will end this year?
A: Yes, but that tells only part of the story of the endgame for America s longest war.

No deal, no troops, the White House says.
There also are political factors.
A war-weary American public appears to have little appetite for even a slimmed-down commitment to remaining involved in the inconclusive war, which began in 2001 and is the longest in American history.
Q: Is Obama likely to abandon the idea of providing a follow-on advisory force?
FILE - This Dec.
NATO advisory mission.
Less than a year after he took office, Obama took ownership of the war by ordering an extra 30,000 troops into battle, saying America s security depends on a stable Afghanistan.
Michael O Hanlon of the Brookings Institution think tank said in an email interview Thursday that by choosing the  zero option,  as it has come to be called, Obama would be  perilously close to conceding — or at least risking — defeat  in Afghanistan.
He does not believe Obama is leaning toward that option.
Q: How is it possible that, after 13 years of war, the Afghan forces are not ready to stand on their own?
A: It depends on how you look at it.
S.
Afghan army has shown it can stand up to the Taliban.
Afghan forces have taken the lead combat role for many months now.
But they have enjoyed the luxury of knowing that American troops have their backs.
The problem is not the Afghans  will or ability to fight.
The problem, from a purely military standpoint, is the government s limited ability to sustain them in that fight.
In other words, the Afghans need help running their own defense establishment to keep weapons and supplies — and paychecks — flowing to the troops, and to develop effective air forces.

The War in Afghanistan is the first major conflict of the 21st Century.
Though the origins of the war involve the ongoing Afghan Civil War and the Soviet Invasion and Occupation of the 1970s and 1980s, the current war began in October, 2001 in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States.

In this realm of chaos, some former Mujahadeen found a leader in Mullah Mohammed Omar.
A Mullah is an Islamic religious leader.
A former Mujahadeen fighter who returned to his home village after the fall of the Communist regime, this member of the Pashtun ethnic group led a new armed group called the Taliban.
The word Taliban means  student,  and many of the original recruits to Omar s movement were Islamic religious students.
Other former Mujahadeen leaders of Pashtun background joined with the Taliban as this new group sought to impose law and order on the country.
The particular law they sought to impose was an extreme version of Islamic law.
Men are expected to grow beards and attend religious services regularly.
Television is banned, and religious minorities such as the Hindus were required to wear some sort of identifying clothing.
Islamic idols and statues in areas under their control.
Qaida organization.
In 1994, the Taliban attacked and defeated local warlords and began to gather a reputation for order and military success.
Pakistan soon began supporting them, partially as a means of establishing a stable, friendly government in Kabul.
The continual fighting between the former Mujahadeen armies caused waves of refugees to flood Pakistan s border regions and interfered with Pakistani trade in the region.
In late 1994, the Taliban took control of Kandahar, acquiring a large supply of modern weapons, including fighter aircraft, tanks and helicopters.
In January of 1995, the Taliban approached Kabul.
From that point onward, until they seized Kabul in September, 1996, the Taliban fought against several militias and warlords, eventually defeating them all.
Taliban leaders and their forces fled to the northern part of the country to continue fighting against the Taliban.
One of these leaders, or warlords, was Ahmed Shah Massoud.
From his loss of Kabul until 1999, Ahmed Shah Massoud s forces remained within artillery range of the capital city, which he attacked regularly.
Communist  and Iran, both of whom feared the growing power of the Taliban.
Russia has fought Muslim rebels in its own Chechnya region and on behalf of the government of Tajikistan.
Moscow feared the Taliban as a source of aid and support for the rebels it has fought in Chechnya and Tajikistan.
Iran, dominated by Shiite Islamic fundamentalists, was at odds with the Sunni Muslim Taliban, largely over the treatment of the Afghan Shiite minority called the Hazaris.
By 1997, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.
Pakistan s role in the Taliban success is controversial, as it is generally believed that several Taliban military victories are directly attributable to armed Pakistani intervention.
Sharif, the Taliban provoked the hostility of the area s Shiite Hazari minority  who do not meet the Taliban s strict religious standards , and the warlord, General Malik, ended his dalliance with the Taliban.
The result was the execution of at least 3,000 captured Taliban soldiers by Malik and the Hazaris.
Sharif and summarily massacred at least 2,000 Hazaris.

Throughout the years of the Taliban s ascendancy, Iran supplied arms and military training to the  United Front Northern Alliance  forces in Northern Afghanistan who were fighting the Taliban.
The Northern Alliance includes the Uzbek forces of General Dostum, the Tajik troops of former President Rabbani and the Shiite Hazaris led by Haji Mohammed Mohaqiq.
Qaida organization in Afghanistan.
Through the Autumn of 2001, the Taliban continued to pressure the Northern Alliance, often with the aid of Osama bin Laden and his Arab forces.
On September 9, 2001, the Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud was mortally wounded in an assassination attempt carried out by two Arab men posing as journalists.
This attack was the work of bin Laden s organization as a possible prelude to the airline hijackings and terrorism in the United States on September 11.
The Northern Alliance responded to Massoud s killing with an aerial attack on Kabul the night of September 11.
It is now known that the killing of Massoud was coordinated with the terror attacks on the United States which took place on September 11.
Qaida and its Taliban sponsors as the first phase of what became known as the Global War on Terror.
Qaida targets.
On the ground, American, British and other Allied special forces troops worked with the Northern Alliance to begin a military offensive to overthrow the Taliban.
This alliance between the Northern Alliance and the Allies led to coordination between Allied air attacks and ground attacks by the Northern Alliance.
These attacks led to the fall of Kabul on Nov.
13, 2001, as the Taliban retreated from most of northern Afghanistan.
Qaida retreated toward the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
From 2002 onward, the Taliban focused on survival and on rebuilding its forces.
From 2005 to the present  winter 2007 , the Taliban has increased its attacks and is using suicide bombers and other tactics from the Iraq War.
On February 27, 2007, while on a diplomatic trip to Afghanistan, an apparent assassination attempt was made by Taliban insurgents, who claimed that Cheney was a target in the attack.
A suicide bomber blew up a checkpoint at Bagram Air Base outside of Kabul, killing 20, including an American soldier.
Cheney was unhurt in the attack.
In the spring and summer of 2008, the violence in Afghanistan claimed more coalition  foreign  troops than died in the concurrent Iraq War.
The Taliban, enjoying strong bases in Pakistan, enjoyed a resurgence and showed that it could launch large, coordinated, and effective attacks on coalition and Afghan forces.
August, with a force of about 100 Taliban ambushing French forces near Kabul.
Ten French troops were killed, and 21 wounded.

Date: January 1842.
Place: Central Afghanistan.
Generals: General Elphinstone against the Ameers of Kabul, particularly Akbar Khan, and the Ghilzai tribal chiefs.
Size of the armies: 4,500 British and Indian troops against an indeterminate number of Ghilzai tribesmen, possibly as many as 30,000.
The British infantry, wearing cut away red jackets, white trousers and shako hats, were armed with the old Brown Bess musket and bayonet.
The Indian infantry were similarly armed and uniformed.
The Ghilzai tribesmen carried swords and jezail, long barrelled muskets.
Winner: The British and Indian force was wiped out other than a small number of prisoners and one survivor.
44th Foot, later the Essex Regiment and now the Royal Anglian Regiment.
27th Bengal Native Infantry.
The British colonies in India in the early 19th Century were held by the Honourable East India Company, a powerful trading corporation based in London, answerable to its shareholders and to the British Parliament.
In the first half of the century France as the British bogeyman gave way to Russia, leading finally to the Crimean War in 1854.
In 1839 the obsession in British India was that the Russians, extending the Tsar’s empire east into Asia, would invade India through Afghanistan.
This widely held obsession led Lord Auckland, the British governor general in India, to enter into the First Afghan War, one of Britain’s most ill-advised and disastrous wars.
Until the First Afghan War the Sirkar  the Indian colloquial name for the East India Company  had an overwhelming reputation for efficiency and good luck.
The British were considered to be unconquerable and omnipotent.
The Afghan War severely undermined this view.
The retreat from Kabul in January 1842 and the annihilation of Elphinstone’s Kabul garrison dealt a mortal blow to British prestige in the East only rivaled by the fall of Singapore 100 years later.
The causes of the disaster are easily stated: the difficulties of campaigning in Afghanistan’s inhospitable mountainous terrain with its extremes of weather, the turbulent politics of the country and its armed and refractory population and finally the failure of the British authorities to appoint senior officers capable of conducting the campaign competently and decisively.
The substantially Hindu East India Company army crossed the Indus with trepidation, fearing to lose caste by leaving Hindustan and appalled by the country they were entering.
The troops died of heat, disease and lack of supplies on the desolate route to Kandahar, subject, in the mountain passes, to constant attack by the Afghan tribes.
Once in Kabul the army was reduced to a perilously small force and left in the command of incompetents.
The disaster of the First Afghan War was a substantial contributing factor to the outbreak of the Great Mutiny in the Bengal Army in 1857.
The successful defence of Jellalabad and the progress of the Army of Retribution in 1842 could do only a little in retrieving the loss of the East India Company’s reputation.
Following the British capture of Kandahar and Ghuznee Dost Mohammed, whose replacement on the throne in Kabul by Shah Shujah was the purpose of the British expedition into Afghanistan, despairing of the support of his army fled to the hills.
On 7th August 1839 Shah Shujah and the British and Indian Army entered Kabul.
The British official controlling the expedition was Sir William Macnaghten, the Viceroy’s Envoy, acting with his staff of political officers.
At first all went well.
British money and the powerful Anglo-Indian Army kept the Afghan tribes in controllable bounds, pacifying the Ameers with bribes and forays into the surrounding districts.
In November 1840 during a raid into Kohistan two squadrons of Bengal cavalry failed to follow their officers in a charge against a small force of Afghans led by Dost Mohammed himself.
Soon afterwards, despairing of his life in the mountains, Dost Mohammed surrendered to Macnaghten and went into exile in India, escorted by a division of British and Indian troops no longer required in Afghanistan and accompanied by the commander in chief Sir Willoughby Cotton.
In December 1840 Shah Shujah and Macnaghten withdrew to Jellalabad for the ferocious Afghan winter, returning to Kabul in the spring of 1841.
In the assumption that the establishment of Shah Shujah as Ameer was complete, the British and Indian troops were required to move out of the Balla Hissar, a fortified palace of considerable strength outside Kabul, and build for themselves conventional cantonments.
A further complete brigade of the force was withdrawn, leaving the remaining regiments to settle into garrison life as if in India, summoning families to join them, building a race course and disporting themselves under the increasingly menacing Afghan gaze.
There were plenty of signs of trouble.
The Ghilzai tribes in the Khyber repeatedly attacked British supply columns from India.
Tribal revolt made Northern Baluchistan virtually ungovernable.
Shah Shujah’s writ did not run outside the main cities, particularly in the South Western areas around the Helmond River.
Sir William Cotton was replaced as commander in chief of the British and Indian forces by General Elphinstone, an elderly invalid now incapable of directing an army in the field, but with sufficient spirit to prevent any other officer from exercising proper command in his place.
The fate of the British and Indian forces in Afghanistan in the winter of 1840 to 1841 provides a striking illustration of the collapse of morale and military efficiency where the officers in command are indecisive and wholly lacking in initiative and self-confidence.
The only senior officer left in Afghanistan with any ability was Brigadier Nott, the garrison commander at Kandahar.
Crisis struck in October 1841.
In that month Brigadier Sale took his brigade out of Kabul as part of the force reductions and began the march through the mountain passes to Peshawar and India.
Throughout the journey his column was subjected to continuing attack by Ghilzai tribesmen and the armed retainers of the Kabul Ameers.
Sale’s brigade, which included the 13th Foot, fought through to Gandamak, where a message was received summoning the force back to Kabul, Sale did not comply with the order and continued to Jellalabad.
In Kabul serious trouble had broken out.
On 2nd November 1841 an Afghan mob stormed the house of Sir Alexander Burnes, one of the senior British political officers, and murdered him and several of his staff.
It is the authoritative assessment that if the British had reacted with vigour and severity the Kabul rising could have been controlled.
But such a reaction was beyond Elphinstone’s abilities.
All he could do was refuse to give his deputy, Brigadier Shelton, the discretion to take such measures.
Until the end of the year the situation of the Kabul force deteriorated as the Afghans harried them and deprived them of supplies and pressed them more closely.
On 23rd December 1841 Macnaghten was lured to a meeting with several Afghan Ameers and murdered.
While the Kabulis awaited a swift retribution the British and Indian regiments cowered fearful in their cantonments.
Attempts to clear the high ground that enabled the Afghans to dominate the cantonments failed miserably, because the troops were too cowed to be capable of aggressive action.
The beginning of the end came on 6th January 1842 when the British and Indian garrison, 4,500 soldiers, including 690 Europeans, and 12,000 wives, children and civilian servants, following a purported agreement with the Ameers guaranteeing safe conduct to India, marched out of the cantonments and began the terrible journey to the Khyber Pass and on to India.
As part of the agreement with the Ameers all the guns had to be left to the Afghans except for one horse artillery battery and 3 mountain guns and a number of British officers and their families were required to surrender as hostages, taking them from the nightmare slaughter of the march into relative security.
In spite of the binding undertaking to protect the retreating army, the column was attacked from the moment it left the Kabul cantonments.
The army managed to march 6 miles on the first day.
The night was spent without tents or cover, many troops and camp followers dying of cold.
The next day the march continued, Brigadier Shelton, after his ineffectiveness as Elphinstone’s deputy, showing his worth leading the counter attacks of the rearguard to cover the main body.
At Bootkhak the Kabul Ameer, Akbar Khan, arrived claiming he had been deputed to ensure the army completed its journey without further harassment.
He insisted that the column halt and camp, extorting a large sum of money and insisting that further officers be given up as hostages.
One of the conditions negotiated with the Ameers was that the British abandon Kandahar and Jellalabad.
Akbar Khan required the hostages to ensure Brigadier Sale left Jellalabad and withdrew to India.
The next day found the force so debilitated by the freezing night that few of the soldiers were fit for duty.
The column struggled into the narrow five mile long Khoord Cabul pass to be fired on for its whole length by the tribesmen posted on the heights on each side.
The rearguard was found by the 44th Regiment who fought to keep the tribesmen at bay.
3,000 casualties were left in the gorge.
On 9th January 1842 Akbar Khan required further hostages in the form of the remaining married officers with their families.
For the next two days the column pushed through the passes and fought off the incessant attacks of the tribesmen.
On the evening of 11th January 1842 Akbar Khan compelled General Elphinstone and Brigadier Shelton to surrender as hostages, leaving the command to Brigadier Anquetil.
The troops reached the Jugdulluk crest to find the road blocked by a thorn abattis manned by Ghilzai tribesmen.
A desperate attack was mounted, the horse artillery driving their remaining guns at the abattis, but few managed to pass this fatal obstruction.
The final stand took place at Gandamak on the morning of 13th January 1842 in the snow.
20 officers and 45 European soldiers, mostly of the 44th Foot, found themselves surrounded on a hillock.
The Afghans attempted to persuade the soldiers that they intended them no harm.
Then the sniping began followed a series of rushes.
Captain Souter wrapped the colours of the regiment around his body and was dragged into captivity with two or three soldiers.
The remainder were shot or cut down.
Only 6 mounted officers escaped.
Of these 5 were murdered along the road.
On the afternoon of 13th January 1842 the British troops in Jellalabad, watching for their comrades of the Kabul garrison, saw a single figure ride up to the town walls.
It was Dr Brydon, the sole survivor of the column.
The entire force of 690 British soldiers, 2,840 Indian soldiers and 12,000 followers were killed or in a few cases taken prisoner.
The 44th Foot lost 22 officers and 645 soldiers, mostly killed.
Afghan casualties, largely Ghilzai tribesmen, are unknown.
The massacre of this substantial British and Indian force caused a profound shock throughout the British Empire.
Lord Auckland, the Viceroy of India, is said to have suffered a stroke on hearing the news.
Brigadier Sale and his troops in Jellalabad for a time contemplated retreating to India, but more resolute councils prevailed, particularly from Captains Broadfoot and Havelock, and the garrison hung on to act as the springboard for the entry of the “Army of Retribution” into Afghanistan the next year.
The First Afghan War provided the clear lesson to the British authorities that while it may be relatively straightforward to invade Afghanistan it is wholly impracticable to occupy the country or attempt to impose a government not welcomed by the inhabitants.
The only result will be failure and great expense in treasure and lives.
The British Army learnt a number of lessons from this sorry episode.
One was that the political officers must not be permitted to predominate over military judgments.
The War provides a fascinating illustration of how the character and determination of its leaders can be decisive in determining the morale and success of a military expedition.
It is extraordinary that officers, particularly senior officers like Elphinstone and Shelton, felt able to surrender themselves as hostages, thereby ensuring their survival, while their soldiers struggled on to be massacred by the Afghans.

The following article which appeared in the Washington Post, on July 19, 1992, has been reposted here.
It is an article looking at CIA involvement in the Afghan war, and is provided here as some additional background to Afghanistan.
This article is also available from this link from the Washington Post web site for a fee, but has been posted here for Fair Use purposes only.
It should also be noted that it was this Emperor s Clothes article from where I saw this article.
A specially equipped C-141 Starlifter transport carrying William Casey touched down at a military air base south of Islamabad in October 1984 for a secret visit by the CIA director to plan strategy for the war against Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
Helicopters lifted Casey to three secret training camps near the Afghan border, where he watched mujaheddin rebels fire heavy weapons and learn to make bombs with CIA-supplied plastic explosives and detonators.
During the visit, Casey startled his Pakistani hosts by proposing that they take the Afghan war into enemy territory -- into the Soviet Union itself.
Casey wanted to ship subversive propaganda through Afghanistan to the Soviet Union s predominantly Muslim southern republics.
The Pakistanis agreed, and the CIA soon supplied thousands of Korans, as well as books on Soviet atrocities in Uzbekistan and tracts on historical heroes of Uzbek nationalism, according to Pakistani and Western officials.
Casey said, according to Mohammed Yousaf, a Pakistani general who attended the meeting.
S.
Afghanistan, according to Western officials.
S.
Soviet commanders and soldiers.
Casey saw it as a prime opportunity to strike at an overextended, potentially vulnerable Soviet empire.
Eight years after Casey s visit to Pakistan, the Soviet Union is no more.
Afghanistan has fallen to the heavily armed, fraticidal mujaheddin rebels.
The Afghans themselves did the fighting and dying -- and ultimately won their war against the Soviets -- and not all of them laud the CIA s role in their victory.
But even some sharp critics of the CIA agree that in military terms, its secret 1985 escalation of covert support to the mujaheddin made a major difference in Afghanistan, the last battlefield of the long Cold War.
How the Reagan administration decided to go for victory in the Afghan war between 1984 and 1988 has been shrouded in secrecy and clouded by the sharply divergent political agendas of those involved.
But with the triumph of the mujaheddin rebels over Afghanistan s leftist government in April and the demise of the Soviet Union, some intelligence officials involved have decided to reveal how the covert escalation was carried out.
This article and another to follow are based on extensive interviews with Yousaf as well as with more than a dozen senior Western officials who confirmed Yousaf s disclosures and elaborated on them.
S.
Soviets to react in hot anger.
The escalation that began in 1985  was directed at killing Russian military officers,  one Western official said.
One source of jitters was that Pakistani intelligence officers -- partly inspired by Casey -- began independently to train Afghans and funnel CIA supplies for scattered strikes against military installations, factories and storage depots within Soviet territory.

To Yousaf, who managed the Koran-smuggling program and the guerrilla raids inside Soviet territory, the United States ultimately  chickened out  on the question of taking the secret Afghan war onto Soviet soil.
An intelligence coup in 1984 and 1985 triggered the Reagan administration s decision to escalate the covert progam in Afghanistan, according to Western officials.
The United States received highly specific, sensitive information about Kremlin politics and new Soviet war plans in Afghanistan.
Already under pressure from Congress and conservative activists to expand its support to the mujaheddin, the Reagan administration moved in response to this intelligence to open up its high-technology arsenal to aid the Afghan rebels.

Before the missiles arrived, however, those involved in the covert war wrestled with a wide-ranging and at times divisive debate over how far they should go in challenging the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
S.
Western sources familiar with the Carter document.
The Carter finding sought to aid Afghan rebels in  harassment  of Soviet occupying forces in Afghanistan through secret supplies of light weapons and other assistance.
The finding did not talk of driving Soviet forces out of Afghanistan or defeating them militarily, goals few considered possible at the time, these sources said.
The cornerstone of the program was that the United States, through the CIA, would provide funds, some weapons and general supervision of support for the mujaheddin rebels, but day-to-day operations and direct contact with the mujaheddin would be left to the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI.

It was the largest covert action program since World War II.
S.
Pakistan, the base of the Afghan rebels.
Mainly from China s government, the CIA purchased assault rifles, grenade launchers, mines and SA-7 light antiaircraft weapons, and then arranged for shipment to Pakistan.
Most of the weapons dated to the Korean War or earlier.
The amounts were significant -- 10,000 tons of arms and ammunition in 1983, according to Yousaf -- but a fraction of what they would be in just a few years.
Beginning in 1984, Soviet forces in Afghanistan began to experiment with new and more aggressive tactics against the mujaheddin, based on the use of Soviet special forces, called the Spetsnaz, in helicopter-borne assaults on Afghan rebel supply lines.

The new Soviet tactics reflected a perception in the Kremlin that the Red Army was in danger of becoming bogged down in Afghanistan and needed to take decisive steps to win the war, according to sensitive intelligence that reached the Reagan administration in 1984 and 1985, Western officials said.
The intelligence came from the upper reaches of the Soviet Defense Ministry and indicated that Soviet hard-liners were pushing a plan to attempt to win the Afghan war within two years, sources said.
The new war plan was to be implemented by Gen.
Mikhail Zaitsev, who was transferred from the prestigious command of Soviet forces in Germany to run the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the spring of 1985, just as Mikhail Gorbachev was battling hard-line rivals to take power in a Kremlin succession struggle.
The intelligence about Soviet war plans in Afghanistan was highly specific, according to Western sources.
The Soviets intended to deploy one-third of their total Spetsnaz forces in Afghanistan -- nearly 2,000  highly trained and motivated  paratroops, according to Yousaf.
In addition, the Soviets intended to dispatch a stronger KGB presence to assist the special forces and regular troops, and they intended to deploy some of the Soviet Union s most sophisticated battlefield communications equipment, referred to by some as the  Omsk vans  -- mobile, integrated communications centers that would permit interception of mujaheddin battlefield communications and rapid, coordinated aerial attacks on rebel targets, such as the kind that were demoralizing the rebels by 1984.
S.
Soviet escalation, officials said.
The answers they came up with, said a Western official, were to provide  secure communications , kill the gunships and the fighter cover, better routes for  infiltration, and get to work on  targets  in Afghanistan, including the Omsk vans, through the use of satellite reconnaissance and increased, specialized guerrilla training.

Not only did communications improve, but the Spetsnaz forces were willing to fight aggressively and at night.
S.
Conservatives in the Reagan administration and especially in Congress saw the CIA as part of the problem.
Humphrey, the former senator and a leading conservative supporter of the mujaheddin, found the CIA  really, really reluctant  to increase the quality of support for the Afghan rebels to meet Soviet escalation.
For their part, CIA officers felt the war was not going as badly as some skeptics thought, and they worried that it might not be possible to preserve secrecy in the midst of a major escalation.
S.
In March 1985, President Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive 166, and national security adviser Robert D.
McFarlane signed an extensive annex, augmenting the original Carter intelligence finding that focused on  harassment  of Soviet occupying forces, according to several sources.
Although it covered diplomatic and humanitarian objectives as well, the new, detailed Reagan directive used bold language to authorize stepped-up covert military aid to the mujaheddin, and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal: to defeat Soviet troops in Afghanistan through covert action and encourage a Soviet withdrawal.

65,000 tons annually by 1987, according to Yousaf -- as well as what he called a  ceaseless stream  of CIA and Pentagon specialists who traveled to the secret headquarters of Pakistan s ISI on the main road near Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani intelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels.
At any one time during the Afghan fighting season, as many as 11 ISI teams trained and supplied by the CIA accompanied the mujaheddin across the border to supervise attacks, according to Yousaf and Western sources.
The teams attacked airports, railroads, fuel depots, electricity pylons, bridges and roads, the sources said.
CIA and Pentagon specialists offered detailed satellite photographs and ink maps of Soviet targets around Afghanistan.
S.
Soviet battlefield communications.
Other CIA specialists and military officers supplied secure communications gear and trained Pakistani instructors on how to use it.
Experts on psychological warfare brought propaganda and books.
Demolitions experts gave instructions on the explosives needed to destroy key targets such as bridges, tunnels and fuel depots.
They also supplied chemical and electronic timing devices and remote control switches for delayed bombs and rockets that could be shot without a mujaheddin rebel present at the firing site.
The new efforts focused on strategic targets such as the Termez Bridge between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.
Yousaf said.
In Washington, CIA lawyers debated whether it was legal to blow up pylons on the Soviet side of the bridge as opposed to the Afghan side, in keeping with the decision not to support military action across the Soviet border, a Western official said.
Despite several attempts, Afghan rebels trained in the new program never brought the Termez Bridge down, though they did damage and destroy other targets, such as pipelines and depots, in the sensitive border area, Western and Pakistani sources said.
The most valuable intelligence provided by the Americans was the satellite reconnaissance, Yousaf said.
Soon the wall of Yousaf s office was covered with detailed maps of Soviet targets in Afghanistan such as airfields, armories and military buildings.
The maps came with CIA assessments of how best to approach the target, possible routes of withdrawal, and analysis of how Soviet troops might respond to an attack.
Yousaf said.
CIA operations officers helped Pakistani trainers establish schools for the mujaheddin in secure communications, guerrilla warfare, urban sabotage and heavy weapons, Yousaf and Western officials said.
The first antiaircraft systems used by the mujaheddin were the Swiss-made Oerlikon heavy gun and the British-made Blowpipe missile, according to Yousaf and Western sources.
When these proved ineffective, the United States sent the Stinger.
Pakistani officers traveled to the United States for training on the Stinger in June 1986 and then set up a secret mujaheddin Stinger training facility in Rawalpindi, complete with an electronic simulator made in the United States.
The simulator allowed mujaheddin trainees to aim and fire at a large screen without actually shooting off expensive missiles, Yousaf said.
The screen marked the missile s track and calculated whether the trainee would have hit his airborne target.
Ultimately, the effectiveness of such training and battlefield intelligence depended on the mujaheddin themselves; their performance and willingness to employ disciplined tactics varied greatly.
Yousaf considered the aid highly valuable, although persistently marred by supplies of weapons such as the Blowpipe that failed miserably on the battlefield.

Young Afghans peer out from a popular overlook at Kabul.
This is the cover story in the June 11 edition of The Christian Science MonitorWeekly.
Kabul, Afghanistan — It has become the longest war in US history – nearly 11 years.
It has consumed $57 billion in American development aid.
The US military has spent more than $517 billion trying to subdue and secure one of the most invaded countries in human history.
What, in the end, has the United States achieved after all this time and treasury spent in Afghanistan ?
It s a valid question to ask, especially in an election year.
And it s a question that many Afghans themselves are asking in earnest, as the US considers withdrawing troops by 2014.
Answering this question is tricky.
US military spokesmen point to the dismantling of Al Qaeda and the buildup of an Afghan National Army increasingly capable of protecting the country from its internal and external enemies.
Aid donors point to increased political freedoms, improved economic opportunities, thousands of newly built girls  schools, and rising survival rates for newborn infants and their mothers.
Americans have become increasingly weary of the war.
A Monitor TIPP poll conducted in May found that 63 percent of Americans oppose a newly signed security pact that would keep many US soldiers in Afghanistan after the majority of combat troops are withdrawn in 2014.
Many Afghans, including insurgents interviewed for this story, say that a swift pullout will lead to the collapse of the Afghan government, the breakup of the national army, and the spark of a new civil war.
Still, the past decade hasn t been a waste, many Afghans say.
At least it has created a window of relative peace in which Afghans can create institutions that are worth defending.
Success – defined by both the Americans and the Afghans as a stable, sustainable, and effective government – will largely depend on what happens in the next two years.
If Americans correct past mistakes and build on achievements, they still have a chance to leave behind a country that can survive on its own.
If past mistakes are repeated, the withdrawal could be a messy one indeed – and may prove an ignoble ending to one of the costlier ventures in modern American history.
To help gauge what has been accomplished, the Monitor followed four people from different dimensions of Afghan society – a female university student making her place in the business world, a militant supporter fighting the presence of foreign troops, an Afghan bureaucrat struggling with corruption, and an Afghan Army officer fighting internal ethnic divisions.
Don t try to tell Yalda Samih that nothing has improved since the Taliban left.
As a young university student, studying business at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul , she doesn t need to wear a head-to-toe burqa when she goes out on the streets of the capital city, as she did as a young girl growing up in Kandahar .
While she is religiously conservative, refusing to shake a male stranger s hand, she rejects the narrow-mindedness of the Taliban, who refused to let her and other Afghan girls go to any school except a religious madrasa to learn the Holy Quran.
Secretly, her mother taught little Yalda at home, a risky step that prepared her well for when the Taliban government fell.
Ms.
Samih, a vivacious sophomore, speaking in clear American-accented English, which she polished as a yearlong exchange student in Fremont , Calif.
Few Afghans have seen their lives change over the past decade more dramatically than women.
Once denied the right of education, Afghan girls now make up 35 percent of all the 8 million children enrolled in school.
Once discouraged from leaving their homes, they now take up jobs in schools, government agencies, and aid organizations, and some even serve as members of parliament.
Social custom once made it difficult for male doctors to treat female patients – to even be in the same room with a woman who wasn t a personal relation – which helped give Afghanistan one of the highest mortality rates for mothers in childbirth in the world: 1,600 deaths for every 100,000 births.
Though still high, that rate has dropped to 327 per 100,000 births.
As dramatic as these changes are, women s rights advocates say they could all be reversed if the government of President Karzai falls to the Taliban.
They could even be reversed before that, some prominent Afghan women say, if Karzai makes social compromises to lure Taliban militants to peace talks, or to join a coalition government.
As a possible sop to Taliban conservatives, Karzai welcomed a March 2012 ruling by the country s Ulema Council – its top religious scholars – that women should not work in the same offices as men or travel alone without a male companion.
This is a green light to the Taliban to return,  says Fawzia Koofi, a prominent female member of parliament, who has survived two assassination attempts by the Taliban.  We can t give up now.
We have to struggle.
Masooda Jalal, a popular presidential candidate in the 2004 elections, applauds the support that Americans and other international donor nations have given to advance women s civic rights.
But she warns that true gender equality is still a long way off.
Since the Americans have come, we have gotten more literacy for women.
We have gotten political rights, but we are still considered second-class citizens.
Actually it is the same old slavery system – we are possessions,  says Dr. Jalal.  Now the Americans are leaving.
We are not objecting to that.
Still, the signs of progress are palpable.
9 billion has been spent rebuilding thousands of Afghan public schools, and in every major city and town, girls in uniforms trek to classrooms.
Samih remembers her first day in a real school, back in 2003.
Now in college, she shares a room with three other girls from different ethnic groups and provinces.
None of them play on ethnic stereotypes; all are fierce defenders of a single Afghan nationhood.
Zahra Khawari, a senior in English literature at Kabul University and simultaneously a freshman in business at the American University of Afghanistan, is an Afghan national who grew up as a refugee in Iran and didn t arrive here until 2005.
But she s seen dramatic changes in the educational opportunities for women.
Like many Afghans, she worries the Taliban will return and reverse all of the gains Afghan women have made.
But she thinks Afghans are more educated now and less tolerant of a backward and ill-educated government.
All the people worry, but I won t leave,  she says.  I want to do what I came here to do, and that is to serve my people.
The Taliban won t be so successful with the new generation.
When the Taliban were in power, Abdul Bashir was a university student with few job prospects.
The Kabul he lived in at that time was mainly an empty city of bullet-pocked homes, shabby mosques, and dusty unpaved streets.
White sport utility vehicles dominated the roads, driven by foreign aid workers, although Taliban pickup trucks also spirited through town full of bearded soldiers heading off to war in the north.
Today, Mr.
Bashir s Kabul is a city of newly built concrete mansions, even though the streets remain largely unpaved and muddy.
There are new schools and medical clinics, and Western aid flows readily into Afghan government coffers.
Yet sewage still flows freely in open ditches along roadways, serving as the city s ad hoc waste system.
Kabul remains the largest capital city in the world  pop.
3 million  that doesn t have a modern sewage system.
These two sides of Kabul show how much progress has been made and how the city still has one sandal in a millenniums-old way of life.
Bashir, a quietly intense senior civil servant in the Afghan Ministry of Health, notes that the lack of a sewer system alone creates many of the problems his department struggles with.
Bashir, whose name has been changed because he is concerned his comments could cost him his job.
Bashir was grateful to see the Taliban leave.
But this doesn t make him a fan of the Karzai government, which replaced the Taliban.
If anyone wants to improve themselves, they have to do it themselves,  he says.  From the government, you can expect nothing.
Only those who are relatives of some official receive any help.
Corruption may be the most talked-about subject in Afghanistan, and one that many see as the largest impediment to creating a country that can stand on its own.
While corruption has existed in Afghanistan for centuries, it has become a full-scale industry since the arrival of American troops and Western aid dollars.
For many Afghans, the problem isn t corruption itself, but rather the sense that corrupt officials have ruined the country s best chance at rebuilding by siphoning off vast amounts of the money the US has spent here over the past decade.
No paper trail exists, but Afghans can see where the funds have gone – and haven t.
In rich neighborhoods like Shirpoor and Wazir Akbar Khan, the politically well-connected live in glittery mansions, while the streets in front of these opulent homes remain unpaved.
Hospitals have been built, but doctors are often off running lucrative private clinics.
Schools have been erected, but many teachers don t show up for work because they are paid so little.
Cabinet ministers have been linked to major drug scandals or bank collapses, but none have been charged with any crime.
The problem, says Yama Torabi, head of Integrity Afghanistan, an anticorruption watchdog group, is that Afghanistan s Western donors have a political incentive to support the Afghan government and show results for the billions of dollars that they spend.
But for security reasons, Western donors are often unable to monitor how the aid groups and government agencies spend the funds.
So much of it is simply pocketed by corrupt officials.
Last year, when the USAID  budget for Afghanistan was cut by 40 percent, that was good news for us,  says Mr. Torabi.  The money created public corruption.
The donors have to spend billions to develop this country, and they don t have the capability of overseeing how the money is spent.
Najib Manalai, an independent political analyst who is often sympathetic to the Karzai government, believes it s wrong to assume that the Afghan government has done nothing with the billions in foreign aid money it has received.
Eight million children are now in public schools.
Some 44,000 students have been accepted by universities.
Maternal and infant mortality rates are dropping because of the 15,000 clinics that have been built.
More than 12,000 miles of roads have been created.
Yet he sees corruption as a corroding force, chipping away at the Afghan people s faith in their government and their willingness to back the Karzai regime if it comes under attack.
If the government doesn t do its job, it s corruption,  says Mr. Manalai.  If it appoints incapable people to high positions of power, it s corruption.
If elite people grab land, it s corruption.
When Afghan people are trying to get their ID cards and you have to pay a small bribe, it s corruption.
No one knows how much of the $517 billion the US has cumulatively spent in Afghanistan has been misused.
Statistics wouldn t tell the full picture, anyway, since corruption usually involves manipulating statistics to hide illicit gain.
But if you add up the anecdotes of schools or clinics built with shoddy materials; of politicians who have used their positions to steal public land, siphon off money for personal use, or to protect criminal enterprises; and of civil servants who have taken bribes; you get a troubling view of Afghanistan s political culture.
Scandals, such as the near-collapse of Kabul Bank, perhaps symbolize how deep the corruption runs.
Founded by major Afghan political players, such as Karzai s brother Mahmoud, Kabul Bank operated a virtual Ponzi scheme, Western diplomats say, with loans of hundreds of millions of dollars given out to friends with no paperwork and no accountability.
The Afghan government finally moved in to guarantee investors  money and now says the institution s losses may total $900 million or more.
At the Ministry of Health, Bashir sees the effects of corruption everyday, and it costs lives.
He points to a CT scanner bought for $200,000 that has rarely been used, and now sits broken.
The funds for its repair have been requested and promised, but never delivered.
Bashir s brother, who lives in the US, has tried to persuade him to leave Afghanistan, but Bashir says he will stay and serve his people.
I was thinking about it,  he admits.  But the next day I was driving, and I saw children playing in the road.
They were poor; but they were happy, playing there in the road.
He pauses.
These people need me.
When you shake the hand of Sultan Mahmud, a middle-aged man with a graying beard, you can feel the calluses of someone who has worked with his hands his entire life.
Sometimes that work has been as a shopkeeper, sometimes as a farmer; and during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1991, Mr.
Mahmud was a fighter with one of the most radical of Islamist mujahideen parties, the Hizb-e-Islami led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
Mahmud – not his real name – says he stopped fighting when the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996, and he didn t rejoin the war as many of his younger neighbors did when the Americans helped to push the Taliban out in January 2002.
But as a resident of Konar Province in the northeastern part of the country along the Pakistani border – a virtual no-go zone for most foreign aid groups, and site of some of the fiercest fights for American forces over the past decade – Mahmud is decidedly on the side of the insurgents.
As a former warrior himself, he now sees a younger generation of Hizb-e-Islami fighters launching regular attacks against a nearby US military base.
It s a fight he sees daily, because his farm is within sight of the military outpost.
The people of Konar are now fed up, Mahmud says, both with their own government, which is unresponsive and corrupt, and with the continued presence of foreign troops, which many people see as an occupation force unfriendly to Islam and to Afghan tradition.
The foreign troops haven t even bothered to create projects, such as a hydropower dam along the Konar River, that could have made a difference in people s lives, he adds.
The problem is the existence of foreign soldiers on Afghan soil,  he says. With their  night raids,  in which Americans raid suspected militants  homes to capture fighters while sleeping, Mahmud says the Americans  attack our people.
If the goal of sending troops to Afghanistan was to uproot Al Qaeda and to stop its use of Afghanistan as a haven, then Operation Enduring Freedom has been a remarkable success.
But if the goal is sustainable peace, and leaving behind an Afghan government with an army and security apparatus capable of defending the country from external and internal threats, then America and its allies have a long way to go.
And Konar Province will be one of the places where the Afghan Army s capabilities will be put to the sternest test.
Statistics are inadequate to conclude whether the past decade has been a success or failure.
Al Qaeda may have had just a few hundred members in 2001, when the war began.
Many of its top leaders, including Osama bin Laden , have been killed, while others have been either captured or dispersed around the world.
But that dispersal has created Al Qaeda franchises in the Arabian Peninsula , the Horn of Africa , and elsewhere.
As for the Taliban, who once controlled 90 percent of Afghanistan and numbered in the tens of thousands, they now have the ability to hold territory in places like Helmand in the south and Nooristan in the east, and to create a sense of insecurity in many rural areas that effectively weakens trust in the Afghan government.
I don t think that the Taliban will effectively take over after the withdrawal of American troops in 2014 because they are now more fragmented, basically village militias,  says Fabrizio Faschini, a security expert at the Afghanistan Analysts Network in Kabul.  But I am pessimistic about the capability of the Afghan National Army to take over security when the Americans leave.
The insurgents show no sign of giving up.
A coordinated string of six separate attacks April 15, in Kabul and in the provinces of Logar and Nangarhar , showed the ability of militants to conduct well-planned strikes in urban centers where the Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army conduct regular searches.
Yet US military officials say that the Afghan forces proved their ability in the assaults, clearing out the insurgents without NATO assistance.
NATO commander Gen.
John Allen said after the attacks.
Across the border in Pakistan , where insurgents continue to find havens in the loosely governed tribal areas of Northern Waziristan ; Bajaur district; and the outskirts of Peshawar , Pakistan; Taliban supporters say they won t stop fighting until the foreign troops leave.
Taliban supporter in Peshawar who refuses to give his real name.
As chief of security for Nangarhar Province – a crucial link in Kabul s attempts to control areas along the Pakistan border – Abdullah Stanekzai may have one of the hardest jobs in the country.
Not only does he have to fight insurgent groups, such as the Taliban and Hizb-e-Islami, but he also faces internal corruption and a new wave of kidnappings that leave the province increasingly uneasy about their security.
MELTING POT OR CALDRON?
Armies around the world have learned this lesson: Put together people from different ethnic and economic backgrounds, force them to fight together, and you build a common sense of purpose and identity.
It was true for the Anglo-Saxons, Italians, Boston Irish, Poles, Jews, Latinos, native Americans, and African-Americans who fought under the US flag during World War II.
There is no reason it shouldn t have worked for the 180,000 men and women serving in the Afghan National Army.
But it hasn t fully.
Ahmedullah, an Afghan Army major and an ethnic Pashtun, feels confident that the men under his command are getting better training and feel more of a sense of national purpose than any other Afghan soldiers have since King Ahmad Shah Durrani united Afghanistan in 1747.
But if international donor support is withdrawn from Afghanistan when foreign troops leave in 2014, he says, his battalion will probably disintegrate without the discipline and cultural unity the Westerners help enforce.
If foreign support is taken away after 2014, then things will go back to the days of civil war,  says Ahmedullah, who agreed to talk on the condition that his name be changed.  If a man is Uzbek, he will run away to General  Dostum.
If he is Tajik, he will go to the Panshir.
If he is Hazara, he will go to  Mohaqiq.
This raises a question for many Afghans: If the Army disintegrates, who will defend the country from a return of the hated Taliban?
Of all Afghanistan s challenges – from security, to corruption, to social liberation – probably the most difficult is the task of creating a single Afghan identity.
Afghanistan s population of 30 million people is made up of a dozen or more violently feuding ethnic groups.
Karzai came to power promising ethnic reconciliation – even his clothes preached integration, from his silky green Northern chappan  cloak  to his Pashtun sandals – but his government has been characterized by ethnic rivalry.
With Karzai reaching out to the mainly Pashtun Taliban for peace talks, and surrounding himself in the presidency with Pashtuns, many Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens, and Hazaras are starting to look to their own ethnic groups for leadership.
Ethnic factionalism is one reason the International Crisis Group warned, in a May 2010 report, that the Afghan National Army is  incapable of fighting the insurgency on its own,  the other reasons being drug addiction, illiteracy, and desertion.
On paper, the ethnic breakdown of soldiers within the Army closely matches that of the country, with 44 percent Pashtuns, 25 percent Tajiks, 10 percent Hazaras, 8 percent Uzbeks, and 13 percent members of other groups.
But loyalties among these soldiers are divided, the Crisis Group report found, with Pashtun soldiers likely to favor Pashtun commanders and the Pashtun Defense Minister Rahim Wardak, and Tajiks favoring the Tajik commanding general Bismillah Khan.
That the Taliban was once made up primarily of ethnic Pashtuns has made it hard for many of them to feel trusted or welcome in their own country, says former Transport and Aviation Minister Hamidullah Farooqi, an ethnic Pashtun.
In the first year after the Taliban left, the rest of the people said that a Taliban equals a Pashtun, and the people of the north used that against the people of the south,  says Mr. Farooqi. This discrimination  pushed Pashtuns into a corner; it pushed them to be Taliban.
The problem has gotten worse, as Karzai fills his cabinet and immediate pool of advisers with those of his own ethnic groups, while other top politicians of other ethnic groups do the same.
On one level, this is a matter of personal loyalty, but it reinforces ethnic division.
Part of the problem, says Hussein Yasa, a newspaper publisher in Kabul, is that Afghanistan has few institutions that can unify Afghans.
The country has a single parliament, but there are so many political parties – 259 at last count – that none is able to speak for a majority of Afghans.
Religion would seem to be a uniter; but while most Afghans are Muslim, the divide between the 80 percent who are Sunni Muslims and the 20 percent who are Shiites becomes a dangerous source of contention.
The solution is inclusion, Mr.
Yasa says.
Ms.
Koofi, the liberal female parliamentarian who is of Tajik ethnicity, says that most Afghans are well ahead of their leaders when it comes to living an inclusive, tolerant daily life.
You don t see this problem at the community level, because as communities we get together and solve problems.
Koofi.
Koofi says she doesn t believe Afghans will allow themselves to be manipulated by ethnic divisions the way they were during the civil war of the 1990s.
You can t impose a government on the people when the people are educated, and when they remember the days of war,  she says.  The hope I have is my people.

I report on the many facets of military health, including PTSD, suicide prevention, service dogs, medical retirement, and wounded warrior recovery.
The International Business Times reported Friday that the Department of Veterans Affairs had stopped releasing the number of non-fatal casualties of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, thus concealing what the paper called a “grim milestone” of 1 million injuries.
All that can be said with any certainty is that as of last December more than 900,000 service men and women had been treated at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics since returning from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the monthly rate of new patients to these facilities as of the end of 2012 was around 10,000.
Beyond that, the picture gets murky.
In March, VA abruptly stopped releasing statistics on non-fatal war casualties to the public.
S.
Iraq and Afghanistan without warning, claiming unspecified “security” reasons.
After the story was published, the International Business Times reported that VA announced it would release updated figures in November.
Traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to my own reporting, account many non-fatal casualties treated by VA.
Nearly 270,000 brain injuries have been diagnosed by the Defense Department since 2001, most of them were likely sustained in Iraq or Afghanistan.
It’s estimated that 1 in 5 veterans of those conflicts have PTSD, a number that reached 300,000 several years ago and is probably much higher now.
The 1 million mark, though bleak, does not necessarily reflect a drastic increase in the number of catastrophic injuries.
Earlier this year, I reported that of the more than 50,000 service members wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan who are considered polytrauma patients, 1,600 have moderate to severe brain injuries, 1,400 are amputees, and 900 were severely burned.
Since then, about 200 service members have lost limbs in a combat zone.

In Afghanistan, there are at least 2 major languages  DARI, Poshtu  and maybe 17 total  Dari, Poshtu, Pashai, Nuristani, Baluchi,- just off the top of my head .
The tribal construct is wholly different, too.
This was a bad video report with inaccurate information.
They are exporting drugs to the USA to pay the Afghanies, so they can buy weapons from the USA to keep big weapons companies in business.
If the Afghanies have no money they will not be able to fight.
The CIA can shut the heroine business down in 24 hours by burning all the crops.
Well, well well.
Can this freaking idiot ever keep his word ?
S.
S.
Obama and his team of libtards was in a rush to get them out, just one of his many blunders.
S.
Delaying the departure of all US troops from Afghanistan will guarantee a continuation of the war, of our troops getting killed and millions more down the drain.
And the continued use of   al Qaeda and the Taliban  to define the insurgents will get some continued support from the US public of the war but as we must all understand by now, most of the  insurgents  are of the people who want to see an end of our occupation of their country.
But this would not include many of the corrupt government officials and the police forces who profit from our  reconstruction  funding and the growing drug trade.
But lets see how honest or corrupt this next  election  might turn out to be.
There is always the chance that things might change for the better.
But it would likely take something like an Afghan Ataturk to make it happen.
Comparing Iraqi lessons to Afghanistan and vice versa is plain skewed, arrogant American thinking.
Lord, free us from the evil of Western governments, and their insatiable desire to control everything under the sun and moon.
Good luck trying.
There are many standing to oppose this attempted cruel domination of the world resources by Jinn billionaires and their politico fiends.
Lord help us escape the hate sowed by those who wish to kill and capture anyone who doesn t believe as they do.
I don t think the drug lords keep their loot and higher politics there when they have Pakistan next door.
Actually the US nd Afghanistan have not agreed on a pact.
Obama and Karzai agreed, but unlike in the US, in Afghanistan there is a modicum of democracy.
The Bilateral Security Agreement  BSA  must be agreed by a 300-person Loya Jirga  Nov 21  and then by the Afghan parliament.
Karzai has repeatedly complained about the raids, and many Afghans understandably don t like them and have so demonstrated.
Time to go back to the protesting era of the 60 s.
C.
Let s get the heck outa  there and next war they come up with has to have Congress and their families fight it.
It only goes on as a war of choice.
I can forgive Obama misstating that people can keep insurance policies if they like them.
But the promise was we d be out of Afghanistan by 2014.
Not to do so would be a breech of public trust that I and many would hold against him.
May I need to remind you that the KPA pushed all the way down to Busan?
They had the entire peninsula.
But after Incheon we pushed back to the Yalu River and the Chinese got involved.
The Armistice talks started in 1951.
1 year after the invasion of the communists from the North.
You know.
I am kind of sad that I read your comment.
I have spent 2 years in the ROK because I absolutely love it.
I love the people, the food, and the country.
Not only that, but I serve up in the JSA.
I have pulled security for peace talks involving everything from YP-Do to the KI complex.
I live and work with the ROK army and for a man who has done his 2 years of military service I must ask.
Do YOU truly think that a conscript Army can hold it s own?
Look at pictures of Seoul in 1953 and then again 60 years later in 2013.
40% of the cost?
DO you KNOW how many Korean s the US Army employs in the ROK.
There is only one other country in this world that I would have the honor, and love to defend.
If anything is the definition of a  good war , that was it.
And then you would probably be speaking Farsi, Mandaren or Russian.
11B_INF_Retired  But Retired, we re not actively in a war zone, as we are in the middle east.
Sure there are troops amassed on both sides of the DMZ, but not a single bullet has been fired at either side since the mid 1950s.
So stop trying to play the  I know more than you  card.
It s a bad look.
DonGettys Armistice, 1954 -- the best of both worlds.
Now it s a war, now it isn t, just spend, spend spend.
It s the gift that keeps on giving to the MIC, and the US gets permanent bases one air-hour from Shanghai and Beijing.
45ashton    That s right.
The world is black or white in a lot of American minds and we certainly can t nuance, change our minds, or negotiate on a matter.
When Bush said Saddam had to go  very early in his presidency ,  it was written in blood and, by God, he kept his promise with just a few little teeny lies to sell to the American people.
Certainly no breech of public trust because he kept his word.
The war in Iraq ended for us and that is what matters for me and my family and the US.
If anyone from the US wants to be a war monger no one is stopping them from going to Iraq on their own but for the US it is all done.
Don_Bacon   @tkulaga Yes they can, veterans can find a job, for starters they have to want one.
So very very NOT true.
Ask any US soldier who was deployed to the DMZ in the 60 s, 70 s and 80 s.
Ask  the surviving crew of the Cheonan.
Ask the people who endured the artillery barrage at Yeonpyeong.
RScott I don t remember having commented on Iraq.
But I have worked in Afghanistan off and on since 1971.
Will the war end when and if we leave Afghanistan?
Probably not.
We took out the Taliban government and replaced it with what is there now.
Many in the country do not see it as a legitimate government and certainly corrupt.
One way or the other the present government will probably have to go for the fighting to stop.
If we go perhaps the Afghans will talk and be able to come up with a solution.
Maybe not.
But the Northern alliance people  the minorities  do not want to talk to the Pashtuns who have basically ruled the country since about 1746.
In AFG and Iraq = 10  yrs total overseas experience with civilian agencies and 5 yr intel with Army.
I have seen the wars of revenge up close.
Like using Afghan PRT idea in Iraq.
Or using Sons of Iraq in Afghanistan.
Can t the military get innovative?
Both places are unique: urban vs.
AFG and lots of oil in Iraq.
Many differences and why strategies should ve been different.
Treating everything the same is the problem, and this stems from ignorance and arrogance.
Don_Bacon   @DonGettys  1954?
April 27th 1953.
It s not about the MIC.
I will agree with you, not Korea bud.
Not too many?
So what.
American enough to not fear what you say, or do you think America is losing freedoms?
More authoritarianism.
I doubt it, unless you mean in an uncleared  support role.
The only people with high clearance levels who use phrases like  ...the evil of Western governments, and their insatiable desire to control everything under the sun and moon....  are the occasional turncoats like Snowden.
And even Snowden knew that once you take the mask off, you d better run where they can t get you.
And if you were army intel, you d know that  they can t find out who I am from a web post  is bull.
They can, and do.
So unless I read in the near future about an ex-army spook on the run in Bolivia or wherever, I ll assume you were not in Army intelligence, and more likely, if at all military, something more like  pediatric dentist .
The Soviet Afghanistan War was fought between Afghanistan rebels called the Mujahideen and the Soviet supported Afghanistan government.
The United States supported the Afghanistan rebels in order to try and overthrow the communist government and to prevent the spread of communism.
The leaders of Afghanistan during the war included General Secretary Babrak Karmal and President Mohammad Najibullah.
Soviet Union leaders included Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev.
Leaders from the Mujahideen included Ahmad Shah Massoud  nicknamed the Lion of Panjshir  and Abdul Haq.
US Presidents during this time were Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
As one of its bordering neighbors, the Soviet Union had a long history of supporting and providing aid to Afghanistan.
On April 27, 1978 a Soviet supported communist government took over the country.
The new government was called the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  DRA .
Many of the Afghanistan people did not like the new communist government, primarily because many of the laws went against their Muslim religion.
They began to rebel against the current government.
The rebels called themselves the Mujahideen.
In September of 1979, events in Afghanistan became more unstable when Afghan leader Hafizullah Amin had the current president killed and took control of the communist government.
The leaders of the Soviet Union became concerned that President Amin was having discussions with the United States.
On December 24, 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
They had President Amin put to death and installed their own leader, President Babrak Karmal.
Over the next several years the Soviet Army would battle with the Mujahideen.
It was a very difficult battle.
Many of the Soviet soldiers were untested in battle and their gear was not designed for the harsh environment of Afghanistan.
Also, the Mujahideen soldiers were fighting for their homeland and their religion.
They were fierce fighters and had many good places to hide in the mountains.
As the war continued with little success, it became a source of embarrassment for the Soviet Union.
Their army no longer seemed invincible to the rest of the world.
The Soviets also came under increasing international pressure.
The war was condemned by the United Nations, the US pulled out of the SALT treaty talks, and the US boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.
When Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union he wanted the war to end.
He first tried to increase Soviet troops to end the war quickly.
However, this didn t work.
By 1988 Gorbachev realized the war was costing Soviet troops and hurting their economy.
He signed a peace treaty to end the war.
The last Soviet troops departed Afghanistan on February 15, 1989.
Because the Soviet Union failed in securing Afghanistan from the rebels for such a long period of time, the war is sometimes referred to as the Soviet Union s Vietnam War.
The United States provided the Mujahideen with Stinger missiles.
These enabled them to shoot down Soviet helicopters and were a major turning point in the war.
Around 13,000 Soviet troops were killed in the war.
It s estimated that over 1 million Afghanis died from the war.
Most of these were civilians, not soldiers.
Around 5 million people fled the country of Afghanistan during the war.
Most went to Pakistan or Iraq.
The war destroyed much of the country s infrastructure.
It became one of the poorest nations in the world after the war was over.

WASHINGTON — As the United States and its allies began launching airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in August, another — less public — air war was also heating up: in Afghanistan.
According to the latest Pentagon statistics, US combat aircraft dropped more bombs on Taliban and other militant targets in August than it had in any single month in two years — and nearly triple the monthly average since January.
Officials said they were still compiling the bombing statistics for September but the recent uptick in air attacks in Afghanistan comes as the United States is preparing to pull out about half of its 24,000 troops by the end of the year and curtail most combat operations.
The stepped-up campaign was viewed by some analysts as an effort to beat back recent Taliban gains ahead of the US drawdown.
Others saw it as a preview of what might lie ahead as the Afghan government struggles to maintain its own security and needs sustained US help from the air.
The air power statistics, provided by the US Central Command in response to a Globe request, show 436 “weapon releases” in August, compared with the monthly average of about 150 for the previous seven months.
That marks the most in a single month since August 2012, the figures show.
A Pentagon official, asked about the increase in bombing, predicted that the current level would diminish.
The drawdown of coalition forces in Afghanistan, combined with the increasing combat capability of Afghan security forces, obviously will reduce the level of coalition air activity there in the coming months,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Edward Sholtis, a spokesman for US Air Forces Central Command in Qatar, said via e-mail.
Sholtis did not offer a specific explanation for the stepped-up bombing, but military specialists outlined a variety of possibilities.
The ramping up could mark an effort to preempt possible attacks on US forces as they steadily withdraw from bases in more remote parts of the country, according to Anthony Cordesman, a military specialist and Pentagon adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
We are pulling combat forces out of bases,” he said.
We are shutting down combat outposts.
The attacks also coincide with the height of the so-called fighting season — the warmer months when the Taliban and terrorist groups have historically gone on the offensive.
American military casualties have dropped considerably as Afghan forces have taken on a more primary security role in the country — 48 this year compared with 127 last year, according to official statistics — but US officials in recent days have reported an increase in Afghan military casualties.
He contended that any Taliban gains would be temporary.
There’s nowhere that we have Afghan security forces that the Taliban can get the terrain and hold the terrain,” Campbell said.
The United States plans to keep some 12,500 troops in the country after January to help support and train the Afghan security forces.
Partly as a result, Campbell said, the number of US aircraft inside Afghanistan available to conduct strikes, gather intelligence, and provide logistical support to the Afghans “will be greatly diminished from what we have today” by the end of the year.
Nevertheless, because nearly half of the airstrikes are being conducted by combat aircraft coming from bases or ships elsewhere in the region, the air operations could remain at a high level.
Indeed, some specialists said the recent reliance on more airstrikes foreshadows the next phase of the war in Afghanistan.
Even though we will have less soldiers and Marines on the ground, I think you are going to see the same tempo of operations, air power-wise,” said retired Lieutenant General Richard Y.
Newton, the former vice chief of staff of the Air Force.
Retired Major General Walter D.
Givhan, who led the effort to rebuild the nascent Afghan Air Force in 2008 and 2009, agreed.
US air power has been a critical part of the support of the Afghan security force,” said Givhan, now senior vice chancellor at Troy University.
We have made a lot of progress building up their air capabilities but they are still nowhere near approaching what we have and we can give them.
A number of analysts, however, also warned that more US airstrikes would probably mean more civilian casualties, a highly contentious issue over the years between the United States and its Afghan allies.
Unlike in Iraq and Syria, however, the US Central Command said it does not plan to release daily statistics on air attacks in Afghanistan.
A Central Command spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Belcher, said that in Afghanistan the air operations are responding to the constantly changing needs of US and coalition ground troops who are confronting insurgents.

At the end of December 1979, the Soviet Union sent thousands of troops into                         Afghanistan and immediately assumed complete military                     and political control of Kabul and large portions of the                     country.
This event began a brutal, decade-long attempt by Moscow to subdue the                     Afghan civil war and maintain a friendly and socialist government on its border.
It was a watershed event of the Cold War, marking the only time the Soviet Union                     invaded a country outside the Eastern Bloc—a strategic decision met by nearly                     worldwide condemnation.
While the massive, lightning-fast military maneuvers and                     brazenness of Soviet political objectives constituted an “invasion” of                     Afghanistan, the word “intervention” more accurately describes these events as                     the culmination of growing Soviet domination going back to 1973.
Undoubtedly,                     leaders in the Kremlin had hoped that a rapid and complete military takeover                     would secure Afghanistan’s place as an exemplar of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which                     held that once a country became socialist Moscow would never permit it to return                     to the capitalist camp.
The United States and its European allies, guided by                     their own doctrine of containment, sharply criticized the Soviet move into                     Afghanistan and devised numerous measures to compel Moscow to withdraw.
Soviet combat vehicles move through Afghanistan.
In the summer of 1973, Mohammed Daoud, the former Afghan                     Prime Minister, launched a successful coup against King Zahir.
Although Daoud                     himself was more nationalist than socialist, his coup was dependent on                     pro-Soviet military and political factions.
Since 1955 Moscow had provided                     military training and materiel to Afghanistan; by 1973, a third of active troops                     had trained on Soviet soil.
Additionally, Daoud enjoyed the support of the                     People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan  PDPA , founded in 1965 upon Marxist                     ideology and allegiance to Moscow.
In 1967 the PDPA split into two factions: the                     Parchamists, led by Babrak Karmal  who supported Daoud , and the “Khalqis” led by Noor Taraki.
For the next five years, Daoud attempted                     the impossible task of governing Afganistan’s Islamic tribal regions, while also                     struggling to reconcile the PDPA split.
But the more radical Khalq faction never                     fully recognized Daoud’s leadership, while Karmal viewed the coup largely as a                     means to consolidate his own power.
S.
Daoud’s middle course ended in disaster.
On April 28, 1978, soldiers aligned with                     Taraki’s “Khalq” faction assaulted the presidential palace, where troops                     executed Daoud and his family.
In the following days Taraki became the Prime                     Minister, and, in an attempt to end the PDPA’s divisions, Karmal became Deputy                     Prime Minister.
In Washington, this Communist revolution was met with alarm.
The                     Carter administration recognized that Taraki would undo Daoud’s attempt to steer                     Afghanistan away from Moscow, and it debated whether to cut ties with                     Afghanistan or recognize Taraki in the hopes that Soviet influence could be                     contained.
Although the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs                     Zbigniew Brzezinski advocated the former course, Carter supported the Department                     of State’s advocacy of recognition.
Shortly after the revolution, Washington                     recognized the new government and soon named Adolph Dubs its Ambassador to                     Afghanistan.

Soviet influence at                     bay.

Soviet jockeying.
In the summer of 1979, Hafizullah Amin, a                     longtime ally of Taraki who became Deputy Prime Minister following the April                     Revolution, received word that Babrak Karmal  Daoud’s early supporter  was                     leading a Parcham plot to overthrow the Taraki regime.
Amin took the opportunity                     to purge and execute many Parchamists and consolidate his own power.
Complicating matters further, this internal strife damaged the Kabul                     Government’s major national program, namely, to bring the Communist revolution                     to the Islamic tribal areas beyond Kabul.
By the winter of 1978, this program                     was met by armed revolt throughout the country.
In response, Amin and Taraki                     traveled to Moscow to sign a friendship treaty which included a provision that                     would allow direct Soviet military assistance should the Islamic insurgency                     threaten the regime.
This insurrection intensified over the next year and it                     became increasingly obvious to the Soviets that Taraki could not prevent all-out                     civil war and the prospect of a hostile Islamic government taking control.
By                     mid-1979 Moscow was searching to replace Taraki and Amin, and dispatched combat                     troops to Bagram Air Base outside of Kabul.
This move prompted the Carter                     administration to begin supplying non-lethal aid to Afghan mujahedeen, or Islamic insurgents.
In August, a high-ranking Soviet                     military delegation arrived in Kabul to assess the situation.
S.
Soviet attempt to shore up the Taraki                     regime, and also an opportunity to devise a military takeover.
Regarding the                     latter, most analysts in Washington believed that such a move remained possible                     but unlikely.
But this calculus was bound to change.
Amin sensed the Soviet mission was                     designed to strengthen Taraki at his expense.
In response, forces loyal to Amin                     executed Taraki in October—a move that infuriated Moscow, which began amassing                     combat units along its border.
At this juncture Washington was still unsure how                     to interpret the Soviet maneuvers: was the Soviet Union planning a full takeover                     or did it remain committed to preserving the April Revolution?
Analysts remained                     skeptical that Moscow would occupy the country given the political and economic                     costs.
By the winter of 1979, faced with mutinies and an uncertain leadership,                     the Afghan Army was unable to provide basic security to the government against                     the onslaught of Islamic fighters nearing Kabul.
By that point the Soviets were                     sending in motorized divisions and Special Forces.
Washington demanded an                     explanation, which the Soviets ignored.
Finally, on Christmas Eve, the invasion                     began.
Soviet troops killed Amin and installed Babrak Karmal as the Soviet’s                     puppet head of government.
Although the Carter administration had closely watched this buildup from the                     outset, its reaction following the invasion revealed that, until the end, it                     clung to the hope that the Soviets would not invade, based on the unjustified                     assumption that Moscow would conclude that the costs of invasion were too high.
In response, Carter wrote a sharply-worded letter to Brezhnev denouncing Soviet                     aggression, and during his State of the Union address he announced his own                     doctrine vowing to protect Middle Eastern oil supplies from encroaching Soviet                     power.
The administration also enacted economic sanctions and trade embargoes                     against the Soviet Union, called for a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and                     stepped up its aid to the Afghan insurgents.
In sum, these actions were                     Washington’s collective attempt to make the Soviets’ “adventure” in Afghanistan                     as painful and brief as possible.
Instead, it took ten years of grinding                     insurgency before Moscow finally withdrew, at the cost of millions of lives and                     billions of dollars.
In their wake, the Soviets left a shattered country in                     which the Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist group, seized control, later                     providing Osama bin Laden with a training base from which                     to launch terrorist operations worldwide.
Editor s note: We re monitoring reports of an explosion in Kabul, Afghanistan.

The War in Afghanistan  2001–present  refers to the intervention by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  NATO  and allied forces in the ongoing Afghan civil war.
The war followed the September 11 attacks, and its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and denying it a safe basis of operation in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power.
S.
President George W.
Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda.
The Taliban asked bin Laden to leave the country, but declined to extradite him without evidence of his involvement in the 9 11 attacks.
The United States refused to negotiate and launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the United Kingdom.
The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance.
S.
Taliban from power and built military bases near major cities across the country.
Most al-Qaeda and Taliban were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions.
In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force  ISAF , to oversee military operations in the country and train Afghan National Security Forces.
At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration.
In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
In 2003, NATO assumed leadership of ISAF, with troops from 43 countries.
NATO members provided the core of the force.
S.
S.
Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement and in 2003 launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.
Though vastly outgunned and outnumbered, the Taliban insurgents, most notably the Haqqani Network and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, have waged asymmetric warfare with guerilla raids and ambushes in the countryside, suicide attacks against urban targets and turncoat killings against coalition forces.
The Taliban exploited weaknesses in the Afghan government, among the most corrupt in the world, to reassert influence across rural areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan.
ISAF responded in 2006 by increasing troops for counterinsurgency operations to  clear and hold  villages and  nation building  projects to  win hearts and minds .
While ISAF continued to battle the Taliban insurgency, fighting crossed into neighboring North-West Pakistan.
In 2004, the Pakistani Army began to clash with local tribes hosting al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.
The US military launched drone attacks in Pakistan to kill insurgent leaders.
This resulted in the start of an insurgency in Waziristan in 2007.
On 2 May 2011, United States Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad, Pakistan.
In May 2012, NATO leaders endorsed an exit strategy for withdrawing their forces.
UN-backed peace talks have since taken place between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
In May 2014, the United States announced that its combat operations would end in 2014, leaving just a small residual force in the country until the end of 2016.
As of 2013, tens of thousands of people had been killed in the war.
Over 4,000 ISAF soldiers and civilian contractors as well as over 10,000 Afghan National Security Forces had been killed.

In wars, and especially in counterinsurgency wars such as the American war in Afghanistan, it’s often said that killing civilians creates insurgents.
Gen.
If it’s true, then the United States has created tens of thousands of insurgents since 2001, according to back-of-the-envelope calculations by the military itself and by the National Bureau of Economic Research  NBER , which studied the issue in 2010.
This special issue was reported in partnership with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute.
Because of CivCas , I think we have just about eroded our credibility here in Afghanistan,” said McChrystal in 2010, according to the Marine Corps Times.
Command Sgt.
Maj.
Michael Hall, then an aide to McChrystal, estimated roughly that every civilian killed creates an additional twenty insurgents.
1,500 to 2,000 insurgents; four years later, there were 30,000 to 35,000.
In July 2010, the NBER prepared a study designed to find out exactly how this works.
Called “The Effect of Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq,” it was assembled by researchers from Princeton, Stanford and the London School of Economics, and it was facilitated by Col.
Joseph Felter.
While serving in Afghanistan, Felter worked closely with McChrystal and his successor, Gen.
David Petraeus, in developing counterinsurgency strategy, and he spent time with troops to find out how ISAF’s efforts to reduce civilian casualties were being received.
The NBER report concluded that for each incident involving civilian casualties caused by ISAF, there would be at least one additional violent clash between insurgents and ISAF in that same district over the next six weeks.
It concluded: “The data are consistent with the claim that civilian casualties are affecting future violence through increased recruitment into insurgent groups after a civilian casualty incident.
Radha Iyengar, a  researcher from the London School of Economics who was working at RAND when The Nation interviewed her, was one of the lead authors of the NBER study.
Surprisingly, she says, greater violence against coalition forces followed civilian casualty incidents whether the deaths were caused by ISAF or by the Taliban.
It doesn’t matter if the coalition is responsible for the killing,” she said.
So either way, Afghan villagers blame foreign forces, and such sentiments bolster the insurgents.
Afghanistan’s thirty-four provinces are divided into as many as 398 districts.
In the study, Felter, Iyengar and their colleagues compared the violence with neighboring districts where no civilian deaths occurred, in order to estimate the effects of civilian casualties.
Jacob Shapiro of Princeton, another member of the NBER research team, says that according to their data, the anger, alienation and pro-Taliban sentiment caused by a civilian casualty incident are long-lasting.
The effect takes about fourteen weeks to fade,” he says.
Perhaps the clearest and most succinct explanation of why the war in Afghanistan was failing came inadvertently from General McChrystal himself, in an October 1, 2009, address to the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
Although he was speaking about killing insurgents, not civilians, the US military has often made little distinction—and, in either case, the principle of insurgent math applies.
Intelligence will normally tell us how many insurgents are operating in an area.
Let us say that there are 10 in a certain area.
Following a military operation, two are killed.
How many insurgents are left?
But, McChrystal added, “there are more likely to be as many as 20, because each one you killed has a brother, father, son and friends, who do not necessarily think that they were killed because they were doing something wrong.
It does not matter—you killed them.

It was an understated coda to America’s secret war in Afghanistan—the final and decisive battle of the Cold War, a brilliantly successful covert operation that would also prove to be the start of the global jihad.
In his new book, What We Won: America’s Secret War in Afghanistan, 1979-1989  Brookings Institution Press, 2014 , CIA veteran and Director of the Brookings Intelligence Project Bruce Riedel seeks to answer how and why this intelligence operation succeeded so brilliantly.
Riedel explores the complex personalities in the war—the Afghan communists, the Russians, the Afghan mujahedin, the Saudis, the Pakistanis, and the Americans—and what we can learn from a war in which no Americans fought on the battlefield.
In surveying the decade-long intelligence enterprise, Riedel highlights the complexities of a war influenced both by the weaknesses and mistakes of America’s enemies, as well as the good judgment and strengths of the United States.

The trickiest problem in evaluating a limited war is not  in making clear what limits were observed, or even in trying to  estimate the results of those limits, but in trying to  decide by what standard to judge the limits.
People who ask why  the United States waged a limited war in Vietnam implicitly  assume, for the most part, that this should be considered an odd  anomaly, that total war is the normal form of warfare.
In fact,  wars that approached the abstract ideal of  total warfare  closely  enough for the use of the term to seem even marginally appropriate  have not been all that common.
Historically, limited warfare has been the norm.
The issues involved can be considerably illuminated by  comparison with a very similar war: that fought by the Soviet  Union in Afghanistan.
The problem began in April 1978, when the People s Democratic  Party of Afghanistan carried out a coup and Noor Taraki became the  leader of the new government.
The previous President, Daud   a general who had himself come to power by a coup in July 1973 ,  was killed.
It had not previously been obvious that the People s  Democratic Party was a Communist Party.
In September 1979, Taraki was killed and his former Deputy Prime  Minister, Hafizullah Amin, became the new leader.
In December 1979, there was another coup, in which Amin was killed  and Babrak Karmal  who had been in exile in Moscow  came to power.
Soviet troops parachuted into Kabul December 27 to assist this coup;  four motorized rifle divisions crossed the border the following day.
The New York  Times, February 16, 1989, p.
Karmal was replaced by Najibullah, formerly head of the secret  police, on May 4, 1986.
Soviet troops went into Afghanistan with the assumption that by  siezing the capital they were siezing the country.
During the first phase of the ensuing war, the Soviets conducted  large-scale, conventional attacks, motorized and with heavy weapons  and air power, into rebel strongholds.
Part of the reason these did  not work was that they were both reasonably predictable and temporary;  guerrillas could scatter from the target areas, and return after the  Soviet troops returned to their bases, meanwhile harassing and  ambushing Soviet units to the extent of their abilities.
Another reason for failure was the poor training of the Soviet  Army.
Troops in ambushed units tended to remain with their vehicles,  instead of charging the ambushing forces as they should have done.
Field commander showed too little initiative, waiting for orders  instead of acting on their own.
By 1983 the Soviets had essentially  give up trying to control the countryside; they withdrew into  enclaves and bombed the countryside.
There was a lot of fighting  along supply lines that the Soviets tried to keep open.
In 1984, the Soviets introduced new tactics.
Reconnaissance units  were delivered into enemy territory by helicopter.
When they found  targets, airmobile assault troops, supported by aircraft and  helicopter gunships, attacked.
These tactics achieved considerable  success.
This war began toward the end of Jimmy Carter s term as President  of the United States.
Carter provided some US military aid to the  guerrillas fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan while he was president.
He did not provide a huge amount--about $30 million for 1980.
Under Ronald Reagan this went up $50 million for 1981, $50 million  for 1982, $60 million for 1983, and $140 million for 1984.
These  figures do not suggest a huge differenc in policy between the Carter  and Reagan administrations.
One would not expect deliveries in the  first year after the Soviet invasion of December 1979 to have been  huge; it could legitimately take some time to get the pipeline going.
For the first-year deliveries to have been half of the fourth-year  level actually looks to me as if Carter got things off to a pretty  fast start.
Figures from Cordesman & Wagner, The Lessons of  Modern War, vol.
3, The Afghan and Falklands Conflicts,   p.
20 .
The big break was between Reagan s first and second terms.
US  military aid jumped to $250 million in 1985, and in succeeding years  to $470 million, $660 million, and $700 million.
In 1986, the US  began supplying Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to the  guerrillas.
These imposed such heavy casualties on low-flying  helicopters and assault planes that the airmobile tactics were  largely abandoned in 1987, and the Soviet troops returned to a  strategy of defending strongpoints and supply routes.
In 1988, the Soviets decided to quit, and signed an agreement  under which all their forces were to be out of Afghanistan by  February 15, 1989.
The Soviets continued to send weapons and supplies  to the government they had been backing, and it hung on for a few  years after it was no longer supported by Soviet troops, but finally  fell before guerrilla forces.
The fundamental pattern of the wars in Afghanistan and and Vietnam  was strikingly similar.
In each case, the government of a Third World country was challenged  by a guerrilla war.
In each case there was a superpower  providing massive support to the government; another  superpower provided much more modest support to the  guerrillas.
In each case the superpower backing the government  finally tired of the effort and withdrew its forces.
The government in question had been strengthened enough during the  time it had been supported by large numbers of foreign troops so it could hang on for a couple of years without them, given substantial  financial aid, but soon political turmoil in the superpower supporting  the government led to drastic reductions even in  financial aid, and the government fell to the guerrillas in 1992.
A comparison of the relative degree of outside support for  the guerrillas in the two conflicts is complicated by the  question of the extent to which persons born in North Vietnam  should be considered outsiders when fighting in South Vietnam.
Even if we decide to regard North Vietnamese as foreigners in  South Vietnam, it remains clear that the amount of  outside support given to the Saigon government was far greater  than that given to the Viet Cong  guerrillas, and furthermore that it was  the larger program of US aid to the Saigon government that developed  first, and the smaller program of North Vietnamese aid to the  guerrillas that came chronologically later.
In each case the superpower backing the government claimed  that it was carrying out a commitment to defend a legitimate  local government.
In each case this claim was reduced to farce  at a quite early date when the superpower became dissatisfied  with the ruler it had supposedly come to support, and the  superpower then overthrew or connived at the overthrow of that  ruler.
The United States connived at the coup that overthrew Ngo  Dinh Diem in 1963, though the US had apparently intended that  Diem only be deposed and exiled, not actually killed.
The Soviet  Union directly overthrew and killed Hafizullah Amin, at that time the  Communist ruler of Afghanistan, in 1979.
Before these events,  the government of Hafizullah Amin had a slightly better claim to  legitimacy as a genuinely indigenous regime than had the  government of Ngo Dinh Diem.
After the coups of 1963 in Vietnam  and 1979 in Afghanistan, the status of the government as a puppet   regime created by foreigners was at least as clear in Afghanistan  as in South Vietnam.
The superpower supporting the government also had a variety  of other ways of putting the best light on its actions.
It  described the government it was supporting as democratic in  character  farcical in each case  and claimed that it was  fighting to defend democracy.
It pointed to the modest outside  support given to the guerrillas, and to the guerrillas  use of  external bases and sanctuaries, as the real outside interference  in the affairs of the country, and claimed that its own much more  massive intervention was intended to promote self-determination  by countering the effects of outside support for the guerrillas.
It publicized the humanitarian spirit of its forces, their  provision of medical care for villagers in the areas where they  operated, and so forth.
It claimed to be eager to negotiate a  reasonable compromise settlement of the war, and denounced the  intransigence of the other side as the main obstacle to such a  settlement.
A sample of such propaganda lines on the Soviet side,  remarkably similar to US propaganda during the Vietnam War, was  conveniently gathered together in Pravda International,  vol.
2, no.
5  this issue was not explicitly  dated, but was apparently that for May 1988 , pp.
4-9.
It is, of course, so far from reality that it  would be comic, if not for one sobering thought: many of the  Soviet troops fighting in Afghanistan probably believed that  these fairy tales represented an accurate picture of the cause  for which they were fighting.
In the blink of an eye, Ahmed s home and his shop were bombed into rubble.
Now he is struggling to provide for his family.
Oxfam and partners have been distributing emergency food vouchers to 50,000 families like Ahmad s.
Their bravery and strength in light of the situation they faced is a testament to the extraordinary power of compassion, hope and the will to survive.
To better understand how Afghans have experienced and understand the devastating conflict of the last thirty years, eight nongovernmental organizations operating in Afghanistan conducted research in 14 provinces across the country.
This research focused on individual experiences of the past thirty years of conflict, perceptions of the current conflict and recommendations for alleviating the violence and addressing its root causes.
This research does not aim to provide a full accounting of the fighting or to represent the views and experiences of all Afghans.
Rather, it seeks to more fully articulate Afghan experiences of the conflict and its recommendations seek to convey the aspirations that Afghans have for peace and the future of their country.
The individuals consulted overwhelmingly expressed a desire for peace, which they saw as not just an end to the physical violence of war but included respect for basic human rights, the alleviation of poverty, an effective and accountable government and access to basic services such as healthcare and education.
Take serious steps to establish the rule of law at all levels, crack down on corruption and end the culture of impunity and patronage, including through root and branch reform of the police and judiciary.
Investigate crimes and abuses associated with the conflict.
Commit and deliver not just more aid, but more effective aid for humanitarian, reconstruction and development activities throughout the country.
Hold the Afghan government accountable and provide more support for it to tackle corruption and criminality.
Do more to protect civilians, including tightening restrictions on the use of force.

How many more will die?
In an unjust war?
I wrote this poem last July  2009 .
At the time I was working in Camp    Bastion in Afghanistan, for the NAAFI and was wallowing in self pity as    my partner had just sent me a “Dear John” e mail.
Seeing all those    helicopters coming in with the dead and wounded moved me greatly and put    my own small problems into perspective.
I am proud to have served our    brave service men and women in Afghanistan in my own small way.
What is this cold?
Where have the autumn leaves gone?
This must be the first signs of a new winter?
But here I am alone.
I close my eyes and try to think of home.
Is this really happening to me?

Well why did they go there, for the glory?

The uniform they wore, like a statement of our time.
It says they were different, perhaps two of a kind?
Queen.
Does it make us lads evil for ending these crimes?
For leaving our own children to give those people    our time?
Muslim and Allah knows this as    well.
I’ll bet that you can’t.
This poem concerns the current operations in Helmand province,    Afghanistan.
Note:    Marching Men was written by Martin Harris as a response to the sight of    the coffins of British servicemen returning to this country from    Afghanistan.
And they tell you that God is on your side.
That when you kill its    justified.

But darker.
Under infantry foot.
In stolid white snow.
Fell on the square rocks.
This open grave – white, bare.
Hard in the fray.
Gold bangled over fine red henna.
Herati sand pure and rising to the top.
Nothing mixes and there is no space in between.
If God loved this place he doesn’t now.
And the diesel air and spiteful prayers.
And the things night can hide.
In the dark corners of their own children’s rooms.
In the big shadows of a capital with no master and no disciple.
When it is left alone.
Much for the growing.
Dust from our bombs and inside our APCs.
And ground into our sweaty palms like Mississippi silt.
On highways and in shattered homes.
And screaming vile women.
It is either them or me.
Note: Hannah Carpenter’s partner is in Afghanistan and    this poem records her feelings.
Last words echoed inside my head of  I ll be coming home to you .
I would always be your strength and angel, you knew that from the start.
I go to bed at night, all I feel is you.
I know you ll hear that coming and feel our loving grow.

This poem was written for the BFBS Christmas Day programme    2009.
A FOB on the front line and a base that is Main.
A patrol in the Sangin walking a hedge.
A Chaplin at altar preparing to pray.
Hoping a 9-liner is not burst transmitted.
Fighting the brown outs with blades that they feather.
Rushing through towns and villages snowing.
The table with Christmas fayre abound.
In Afghanistan this Yule time, creating a void.
Our heroes at home at peace with their Lord.
To be with their mates in a hail and flurry.
So that we may enjoy this Christmas Day.

2009, women in Afghanistan knew that the ground was being laid for peace talks with the Taliban.
Peace Unveiled follows three women who immediately began to organize to make sure that women’s rights don’t get traded away in the deal.
One is a savvy parliamentarian who participated in writing the Afghan constitution that guarantees equality for women; another, a former midwife who is one of the last women’s rights advocates alive in Kandahar; and the third, a young activist who lives in a traditional family in Kabul.
Convinced that the Taliban will have demands that jeopardize women’s hard-earned gains, they maneuver against formidable odds to have their voices heard in a peace jirga and high peace council.

Airtime is at 10 PM EST.
Unfortunately, it is not being carried in certain places.
If you can’t watch it tonight, it will be available for streaming here, the day after it airs.
Thank you for your patience!
As a student of women’s courage in the midst of a book on the subject, I LOVE this series.
However, I missed last night.
Can’t seem to find where on the site I can watch it.
Can you help?
Thanks much.
Hope to meet all of you at a future event!

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s … Afghanistan made significant advances towards modernization.
While many of the reforms during this period were ill conceived and transplanting communism into semi-feudal society was not a good idea, the reversal of these secular trends was a direct  result of the US-supported islamic fundamentalist  insurgency, culminating with Taliban coming to power five years after Soviets left.
Bottom line, Afghanistan was sacrificed for the sake of giving the Soviets their Vietnam – it was enough to call Taliban “freedom fighters” and keep them on the US payroll until 1999.
Let’s not be hypocritical and have some historical perspective on this issue.
I was very moved by this story.
I thought it really conveyed the frustrations and the struggles of the Afghan women, as well as Hillary Clinton’s in wanting to better the lives of Afghan women, children and its society.
What I found most interesting was the attitude of the Abassador and his wife.
I thought she was belittling to the women and obviously not in tune with their struggles.
The women are not living in the past, they have to remind people of their recent history under the Taliban, because the Taliban has not paid for their criimes and are now being courted by Karzai in the policy making of the country.
The Abassador’s wife was pathetic and she should have just not said anything.
Again this proves that Abassadorships are fluff posts, consuming government money, which could be used to actually help people and make a difference.
All that said I have learned so much about women all over the world with this series and am very thankful that we live in a country that shows like this can be aired.
Thank you very much.
When will those of us living outside the US be able to watch this extraordinary programming?
Thank you!
Will this ever be available outside of the US?
I have the same problem, cannot watch it from Hungary, any chance I can do that?

The Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, taken together, will be the most expensive wars in US history – totaling somewhere between $4 to $6 trillion.
This includes long-term medical care and disability compensation for service members, veterans and families, military replenishment and social and economic costs.
The largest portion of that bill is yet to be paid.
Since 2001, the US has expanded the quality, quantity, availability and eligibility of benefits for military personnel and veterans.
This has led to unprecedented growth in the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense budgets.
These benefits will increase further over the next 40 years.
Additional funds are committed to replacing large quantities of basic equipment used in the wars and to support ongoing diplomatic presence and military assistance in the Iraq and Afghanistan region.
The large sums borrowed to finance operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will also impose substantial long-term debt servicing costs.
As a consequence of these wartime spending choices, the United States will face constraints in funding investments in personnel and diplomacy, research and development and new military initiatives.
The legacy of decisions taken during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars will dominate future federal budgets for decades to come.

Iraqi help on the ground, broke a two-month ISIS siege of the village of Amerli in northern Iraq.
The militants had been tightening a noose around the farming town, cutting off water, food and power, and residents had begun dying.
S.
Iraqi forces and militias break the siege.
Islamist militant group.
S.
ISIS.
S.
Taliban from Kabul.
S.
Taliban forces.
S.
13-year effort, still under way, to build an Afghan government immune to the Taliban.
S.
2014.
There’s an echo of that Taliban sanctuary in Pakistan in ISIS’s presence in Syria.
Any beefed-up campaign against ISIS militants is going to have to attack their targets in both nations.
S.
Saddam Hussein from Baghdad less than three weeks after invading the country.
S.
And that exposes the futility of the so-called Pottery Barn rule.
S.
But war isn’t always about creating something better.
Sometimes it’s simply about ridding the world of terrorists whose zealotry compels them to kill innocents.
For a warrior-diplomat renowned for his earlier guidelines on going to war — the so-called Powell doctrine required a clear and obtainable objective before the first bombs fell — the Pottery Barn rule proved daunting.
Actually, Pottery Barn doesn’t have such a rule.
If a customer stumbles into a vase and sends it crashing to the floor, the company writes it off as a cost of doing business.
S.
War isn’t a positive experience for anyone, and all involved are ill served by pretending otherwise.
S.
S.
S.
Special Ops raids and reliance on brutal militias will wreak havoc in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future.
S.
Afghanistan will continue for at least two more years.
And the occupation’s core facets—Special Operations raids and reliance on brutal militias—will continue to wreak havoc on Afghan civilians for the foreseeable future, who are caught between the Taliban and their own government.
Last week, President Obama tried his best to spin the facts to announce that the war in Afghanistan was ending.
But the details of the continued occupation that Obama outlined in the speech undermine his assertion.
While many American troops will come home in December, 800 will be left to continue to occupy and wage war in Afghanistan at a cost of at least $20 billion.
Many of those troops will be the elite military units--Special Operations Forces--who bust down doors to kill suspected militants.
S.
S.
Embassy.
S.
Afghanistan has brought to the country, an army that will likely stay for many, many years.
Even if the presence of foreigners is vastly reduced, the people of Afghanistan will remain caught in an endless conflict between the Taliban and Afghan security forces.
So the war will grind on.
S.
Here are three ways the destructive conflict will continue after the end of this year.
1.
In 2009, President Obama announced a “surge” for the Afghanistan war that would send 33,000 more troops to the country.
S.
Many of the raids will be carried out by the Joint Special Operations Command  JSOC , a secretive unit only answerable to the White House that is part of the larger Special Operations Forces.
As Jeremy Scahill’s book Dirty Wars: The World Is A Battlefield documents, the JSOC forces did focus on Taliban and al Qaeda leaders.
S.
The list kept on expanding, and under General Stanley McCrystal, who took over the military’s war effort in 2009, the pace of night raids increased to at least 90 a month.
JSOC forces run roughshod over the authority of the Afghan government, and have killed the wrong people, fueling backlash against the American presence.
JSOC forces have been accused of war crimes.
One operation Scahill documents took place in 2010 in Gardez, Afghanistan.
In a raid based on faulty intelligence, JSOC forces burst into the home of the Sharabuddin family, resulting in the deaths of seven unarmed people, including two pregnant women.
2.
US President Barack Obama speaks during a surprise visit with US troops at Bagram Air Field, north of Kabul, in Afghanistan, May 25, 2014, prior to the Memorial Day holiday.
S.
America s longest war comes to a close.
Speaking to troops gathered in an airplane hangar on this sprawling military base, Obama said the war had reached a pivotal point, with Afghan forces assuming primary responsibility for their country s security.
S.
Afghanistan will leave in the coming months, Obama said a continued military presence could help protect gains made during nearly 13 years of fighting.
Obama declared.
S.
13-year Afghan war and thousands more have been wounded.
Shakib Noori, Former Economic Attaché at Embassy of Afghanistan, describes the country s security situation ahead of Saturday s election.

Afghanistan, under the cover of darkness for his first trip to the war zone since 2012.
He spent about four hours at the base and did not go to Kabul, the capital, to meet with Hamid Karzai, the mercurial president who has had a tumultuous relationship with the White House.
Instead, officials said Obama wanted to keep the focus during his Memorial Day weekend visit on the troops serving in the war s closing months.
S.
Embassy invitation for him to go to Bagram to see Obama.
The White House said Obama was not meeting with the outgoing Afghan president in order to avoid getting involved in Afghan politics.
S.
Obama said,  For many of you, this will be your last tour in Afghanistan.  His comment was met with an eruption of applause.
Obama s visit, his fourth to Afghanistan as president, came at a time of transition for a country long mired in conflict.
S.
Afghanistan are withdrawing ahead of the year-end deadline.

S.
He said that as he entered the briefing room, he saw a poster of the Twin Towers destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks.
Obama was accompanied by a few advisers, including senior counselor John Podesta, whose son is serving in Afghanistan.
Country singer Brad Paisley joined Obama on Air Force One and entertained the troops as they waited for the president.
As is typical of recent presidential trips to war zones, the White House did not announce Obama s visit in advance.
Media traveling with Obama for the 13-hour flight had to agree to keep the trip secret until the president had arrived.
After his remarks, Obama visited with injured service members being treated at a base hospital.
S.
The president s visit took place against the backdrop of growing outrage in the United States over the treatment of America s war veterans.
More than two dozen veterans  hospitals across America are under investigation over allegations of treatment delays and deaths, putting greater scrutiny on the Veterans Affairs Department.
The agency already was struggling to keep up with the influx of forces returning home from Afghanistan and Iraq.
We re going to stay strong by taking care of our wounded warriors and our veterans,  Obama said to applause.  Because helping our wounded warriors and veterans heal isn t just a promise.
The President of the US Business Council in Iraq, Hussain Qaragholi, tells CNBC what international firms face in-country.
Plus, how security costs can impact your bottom line.
Obama has staked much of his foreign policy philosophy on ending the two wars he inherited from his predecessor, George W.
Bush.
S.
Iraq failed to reach a security agreement to keep a small American residual force in the country.
In the years that have followed the American withdrawal, Iraq has been battered by resurgent waves of violence.
S.
Afghanistan.
While combat forces are due to depart at the end of this year, Obama administration officials have pressed to keep some troops in Afghanistan after 2014 to continue training the Afghan security forces and undertake counterterrorism missions.
Pentagon officials have pushed for as many as 10,000 troops; others in the administration favor as few as 5,000 troops.
Obama has insisted he will not keep any Americans in Afghanistan without a signed security agreement that would grant those forces immunity from Afghan law.

Qô0oAè.
An analysis of news reports about the war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2010 shows that reporters at three major US news outlets wrote increasingly negative stories.
The negative tone was particularly pronounced in stories posted by reporters embedded in military units.
When the war in Afghanistan started, the tone of the stories that reporters filed was generally neutral,” says Michel Haigh, associate professor of communications at Penn State.
In 2003, as the media began to focus more on the conflict in Iraq, reporters for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times wrote less than 20 stories about Afghanistan.
Haigh and colleagues examined articles about the war from these three major newspapers during the 10-year period from 2001 to 2010.
Between 2009 and 2010, when casualties reached their highest levels, there were more than 450 articles written about the war in Afghanistan.
The negativity toward the war effort was reflected in stories written by reporters in the field, as well as articles written by journalists in the US and in other countries, says Haigh.
While reporters who were embedded in military units in previous conflicts tended to be more positive about the military, embedded reporters in Afghanistan were typically negative.
In fact, reporters in Afghanistan wrote stories with tones that were slightly less positive about the military than reporters who wrote their articles outside the country.
This isn’t the type of story we expected from embedded reporters,” Haigh says.
Published in Newspaper Research Journal, the study also shows that reporters framed their stories differently as casualties rose.
Framing refers to how reporters decide to tell the story.
For example, a journalist may decide to focus the story on the war on terrorism or on casualties.
In this case, reporters both inside and outside of Afghanistan reported on the increasing casualties.
Reporters who were not in Afghanistan also wrote stories on the economic and political impact of the conflict.
There were fewer embedded reporters in Afghanistan than in previous conflicts.
Because newspapers pay to have embedded reporters travel with the troops, the cost of sending reporters to file stories in Afghanistan was too expensive for most news outlets that were struggling during the economic downturn.
War fatigue may have been another reason for fewer embedded reporters.
The American public was tired of hearing about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
For the study, researchers examined more than 1,100 articles.
A group of eight coders was trained to analyze the frames and tone of the stories.
The coders did not consider opinion and editorial columns when they analyzed the content.
This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

He says he s even been approached for letters by Afghans who never worked for him.
In one case, he says officials in the Ministry of Finance asked him for letters.
In exchange they said they would go easy in their audit of his organization.

Afghanistan nears, demand for special immigrant visas is soaring.
He admits some applicants exaggerate the danger they face.
Frantz says.
He says the State Department errs on the side of leniency in making that initial determination, but that hasn t meant an easy ride for applicants.
In fact, it s been quite the contrary.
From the beginning, the Special Immigrant Visa program was fraught with problems — long processing delays, seemingly arbitrary rejections and a lack of transparency.
Some applicants were killed while waiting years for their visas.
Frantz says that prompted Secretary of State John Kerry to call for a review of the program last fall.
Since then, a host of reforms have been implemented to streamline the process and make it more transparent.

Congress authorized additional visas this year but not nearly enough for the thousands of potential applicants.

Australian Elijah Berry has worked in the security business in Afghanistan for years.
He s come to know many Afghans in that time, and a good number have approached him for help getting a visa to Australia.
They re pretty straightforward,  Berry says.  They say they need to know an Australian for visa purposes.
And like Mazier, Berry has been approached by people who didn t work for him.
He says he s now receiving requests from Afghans who did work for him in the past.
Berry says most are looking to leave Afghanistan because they see the economy collapsing and their friends losing jobs.
Still, these people need to show they are under threat.
Berry says some are presenting him threat letters allegedly from the Taliban.
But Berry says they aren t real.
They are from opportunists with counterfeit Taliban stamps.
Berry says.
Compared with $25,000 to buy a fake visa to a European country, it s a small amount to risk.

When the world hears American leader after leader, make claims of victory and success year after year they can’t help but lose faith in the word of our country.

American clout in Kabul is not what it once was.
American credibility is not simply at risk but has already suffered damage – and remains in a deteriorating spiral.
The gulf between the words and deeds of the United States regarding Afghanistan over the past decade has been so vast that trust in America has been severely degraded.
There are real consequences to this loss of trust and if this trend is not reversed, vital American interests may one day be placed at risk.

Next in line came Gen.
John Allen, who claimed at his change of command ceremony in February 2013 that in fact,  This is victory. This is what winning looks like .
Fox News reported.
Transparency International s Corruption Perception Index ranks Afghanistan as dead-last at 174th out of 174 nations evaluated.
When the world hears American leader after leader make claims of victory and success year after year – yet sees with their eyes that in fact the war has been an unmitigated failure – they can t help but lose faith in the word of our country.
What credibility, then, should the leaders of other nations place in the judgment of America s senior civilian and uniformed leaders when we make assessments on security matters, especially when we might then ask those nations to contribute their treasure or risk their blood in support?
S.
Despite the considerable military and economic power of the United States, the credibility of our words has probably never been lower.
When neither individuals nor nations can take anything our leaders say at face value, the risk increases that they may take action antithetical to our interests.
Friendly nations will be less inclined to make decisions based on mutual benefit and might instead focus only on their own needs, possibly at our expense.
S.

America was a land where the rule of law applied as much to those in positions of power as to the masses.
American ideals of integrity and honor were characterized by George Washington and  Honest Abe  Lincoln.
Our actions of recent years have severely tarnished the traditional American values of honor, respect, integrity, trust and moral excellence.
But this damage is reversible.
We must first jettison the always-misbegotten idea that it is somehow a sign of sophistication to communicate in ‘doublespeak  whereby we say one thing in public that everyone knows isn t what we mean, expecting others to divine our real intention.
A second proclivity which must be discarded is the habit of many in this country of trying to lead and govern by messaging.
Meaning, we select a desired policy or military outcome and then communicate it as though it were already a fact.
The message is then repeated frequently, and with conviction, in the hopes it will one day become true.
It won t.
Instead it will likely spawn new disasters like Afghanistan and Iraq.
Next we must start – or perhaps resume – basing policy decisions on sober analysis of what exists, with a view to finding solutions that are rationally achievable.
Given the chaotic, always-changing nature of international affairs, no one expects American leaders to be right all the time.
What we should expect, all the time, is for our leaders to be open and honest, both with our own citizens and in the conduct of foreign policy abroad in our name.
The damage done to our credibility has taken a real hit over the past decade, but it can be repaired.
Fortunately, America is still filled with considerable numbers of men and women who are imbued with the same character and moral compass that guided the likes of Washington, Lincoln and King, Jr.
For the health of our nation, let us hope they begin to rise soon.

Afghan war.
In the years after the Sept.
11, 2001, attacks on the United States, suspected militants were abducted and held in secret prisons worldwide without charge or evidence.
The United State abandoned that policy under President Barack Obama, but the detention of those being held near Bagram is a reminder that the issue has not been concluded.
Reinert told Reuters.
Almost nothing is known of the detainees  identities.
The United States has declined to disclose their nationalities, where they were captured and how many are still in its custody.
Most of the prisoners are Pakistani, according to the human rights group Justice Project Pakistan.
Some are from Yemen, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
S.
S.
Bagram base handed its Afghan detainees over to Afghan control last year.
The United States wants to repatriate the detainees to their home countries, Reinert said, but that might not be possible because Washington has not received assurances they will not prosecuted at home or kept in humane conditions.
He declined to say how many were held at the prison.
S.
One possible solution could be to transfer them to the United States, where they could be prosecuted.
Reinert said.
They could also end up in Guantanamo Bay, although this was less likely because of pressure to close the facility, he said.
Obama s 2008 vow to close the prison in Cuba has gone unfulfilled, and there are 155 detainees still held there because they are either considered too dangerous to release or the United States cannot find another country to take them.
S.
Maryam Haq, a lawyer with the Justice Project Pakistan.
The United States last week quietly repatriated 14 Pakistani detainees from the facility because there was no real evidence to keep them in prison.
Other Pakistanis repatriated in the past had been held for a decade without charge, Haq said.
The United States had long resisted handing over the prison over concerns  dangerous  prisoners would be set free by the Afghan authorities and had earlier strongly objected to Afghanistan s release of about 65 prisoners.

BBC - American government told other governments about Afghan  invasion IN JULY 2001.
A former  Pakistani diplomat has told the BBC that the US was planning military action against Osama Bin Laden and the  Taleban even before last week s attacks.
Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, was told by senior  American officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of  October.
Mr Naik said US officials told him of the plan at a  UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan which took place in Berlin.
Mr Naik told the BBC that  at the meeting the US representatives told him that unless Bin Laden was handed over swiftly America would  take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and the Taleban leader, Mullah Omar.
The wider objective, according to Mr Naik, would be to topple the Taleban regime  and install a transitional government of moderate Afghans in its place - possibly under the leadership of the  former Afghan King Zahir Shah.
Mr Naik was told that Washington would launch its operation from bases in  Tajikistan, where American advisers were already in place.
He  was told that Uzbekistan would also participate in the operation and that 17,000 Russian troops were on  standby.
Mr Naik was told that if the military action went ahead it would take place before the snows started  falling in Afghanistan, by the middle of October at the latest.
He  said that he was in no doubt that after the World Trade Center bombings this pre-existing US plan had been  built upon and would be implemented within two or three weeks.
And he said it was doubtful that Washington  would drop its plan even if Bin Laden were to be surrendered immediately by the Taleban.

For over 30 years, the Cato Institute has worked to change the climate of ideas.
The cumulative effect of this effort is real impact today.
Here’s how Cato puts Sponsors’ contributions to work.
This turned out to be the greatest applause line of his speech .
With his assertion, Obama, in effect, declared himself the hero of the Afghan war – the one who put an end to that nightmare.
But what Obama failed to mention was that it was his war, and that nothing but unattractive scenarios lie ahead for that war-torn state.
Indeed, Afghanistan might just continue to hold down its ranking as the most violent country in the Global Peace Index .
This gloomy prognosis would not have surprised Thomas Jefferson.
Yes, Jefferson’s words point to a fundamental truth, “Governments constantly choose between telling lies and fighting wars, with the end result always being the same.
Graciana del Castillo, one of the world’s leading experts on failed states, has just written a most edifying book on the Afghan war   Guilty Party: The International Community in Afghanistan.
Xlibris, 2014  .
Del Castillo’s book allows us to finally understand just what a fiasco the Afghan war has been.
Why is Afghanistan, as Bob Woodward correctly termed it , Obama’s war?
5 billion of that  or 75%  took place after President Obama took office  see accompanying chart .
If one pulls apart that $650 billion price tag, a variety of interesting sleights-of-hand emerge.
For example, about $70 billion was disbursed to what is euphemistically termed reconstruction.
But, in reality, 60% of this $70 billion  or $42 billion  was actually spent on beefing up the Afghan National Security Forces.
And not surprisingly, 75% of the $42 billion spent on national security forces was spent under President Obama’s watchful eye.
To put these outsized numbers into perspective, just consider that the total cost of the Afghan war from 2002-2013 amounts to $7089 per American taxpayer  based on the number of income tax returns  .
More revealing is the fact that the annual expenditure rate under the Bush administration was already $222 per taxpayer.
Then, it exploded to an annual expenditure rate of $1329 per taxpayer under President Obama.
In addition to laying out the phenomenal spending magnitudes on President Obama’s watch, del Castillo demonstrates just how unsustainable all this Afghan spending is.
5 billion needed to field the Afghan National Security Forces.
S.
10 times more than the Afghan government actually spent from its own revenue sources.
S.
Afghan forces was almost three times the total revenue collected by the Afghan government.
To put Afghanistan’s financing gap into perspective, the Afghan government estimates the total fiscal deficiency that they will face over the next decade would amount to a whopping $120 billion.
S.
And if this isn’t bad enough, consider that the countryside has been forgotten and neglected during the war years.
It is here where 75-80% of the population resides, and produces its livelihood.
The rural population has done what is only natural – farm a cash crop.
And, the most attractive cash crop in Afghanistan is poppies.
Not surprisingly, the poppy plantations have greatly expanded, from 75 thousand hectares in 2002  near the start of the war , to over 210 thousand in 2013, surpassing the previous peak of 190 thousand hectares in 2007.
Just another small example of the collateral damage associated with war and misguided economic policies in Afghanistan.

Australian soldiers are obliged to adopt a never-too-hard attitude, conditioned by history and training to stick with the fight against all odds.
All very Gallipoli - right up to that moment of withdrawal.
5 billion spent, the obvious conclusion is that it was too hard.
When Prime Minister Tony Abbott joined Australian forces at their Uruzgan base in October, he defined the moment as  bittersweet  - the conflict trailing to its conclusion not in victory or defeat but with,  we hope, an Afghanistan that is better for our presence here .
This accounting after all that sacrifice, though fair and realistic, could sound a touch lame.
That is, except to those who have been there.
Over the years, Australians arriving in Afghanistan were swiftly acculturated to the task ahead, every bit as steep as the Hindu Kush looming beyond.
They were there to protect Afghans, while killing Afghans.
They were required to navigate a maze of tribal contours - befriend one group and you alienate another.
The cultural challenges called more for an army of anthropologists.
Full body searches are not the best means of winning hearts and minds, but what else could the soldiers do in a place where children are wired with high explosives?
Yes we managed to build 200 schools, but where do you find the teachers?
And how do you handle the corrupt governor and the illiterate police chief intent on skimming the budget and manipulating welfare, let alone the basics of dealing with literacy rates that can run close to zero?
I first visited Uruzgan for Four Corners in 2007 to make Forward Base Afghanistan.
The forecast then shared by the Australian and Dutch commanders was that the mission would take at least 20 more years.
At that time, with one Australian killed in action, there was little public disquiet back at home.
When I returned in 2010 to make a two-part series, A Careful War, the casualty count had risen commensurate with opposition.
By then the mission had morphed from counter-terrorism to counter-insurgency.
While our politicians agreed on the worth of staying the course, they had not managed to bring the public with them.
After broadcast, the surprise for me was the way viewers responded - with even greater shock.
Our camera had taken them to a new-age battlefield devoid of frontline and no man s land, where a farmer with a hoe could switch to insurgent with a rifle and back again in the space of a minute.
The complaints from my own industry of unnecessary obstacles to the reporting an already complicated story have never abated.
I began to worry that Australia s longest war was becoming our worst-reported war.
Having the time to confront these obstacles and win trust from the Australian Defence Force, I was able to return in 2011 to embed with Australian special forces, this time for Network Ten.
It was not difficult to understand why public opposition continued to grow, when a shifting rationale failed to clarify the purpose; when benefits were hard to see, and costs were predominantly written in red.
With the casualty count touching 30, Afghanistan had become a narrative of loss.
Once inside the special forces  Camp Russell compound, one of the first soldiers to offer a helping hand was a tall, smart and shy commando, Corporal Cam Baird.
He would become the 40th Australian killed in action.
Thousands of Taliban-cum-anti-government elements were being eliminated, but this metric did not so much count.
Coalition military success could only be affirmed if it accompanied progressive nation building.
And that was something that would take much more than a decade.
In turn, while simple and crude, the Taliban tactic of contesting the ground with homemade bombs and an overarching strategy of waiting out the 50-nation Coalition was effective.
In general I respected the Coalition effort, partly because the complexities deserved better understanding, and because, conspicuously, we were not on the wrong side.
But when green on blue casualties began to spike late in 2011 it felt like time to go.
There was no single explanation, just a rising smell of a struggle that had bled on for too long.
Over time I came to know some of the soldiers to be lost, as well as their families.
I have never been able to bring myself to say the sacrifice was futile, mainly because of nobility and generosity in the mission s humanitarian purpose, which can t be dismissed.
Within the Afghanistan gallery at the Australian War Memorial are resonating observations of a never-simple story.
Aid worker David Savage, who almost lost his life to a suicide bomber, tells of entering a classroom and seeing young girls talking and laughing, a basic right denied by the Taliban.
We may not be able to tangibly demonstrate from maps or from statistics what we ve done in Afghanistan, but we know in the hearts and minds of our soldiers who ve been there that we ve done a good job.

A street outside an Internet café in western Kabul.
During Afghanistan’s civil war, in the nineteen-nineties, western Kabul’s Karta Seh neighborhood was a no man’s land, fought over by three militias.
Photographs by Zalmaï.
In the eleven years since the American invasion of Afghanistan, Abdul Nasir has become a modern and prosperous professional.
A worldly man in his late thirties, he smokes Marlboros, drives a Toyota, and follows Spanish soccer, rooting for Barcelona.
He works in Kabul as a producer for Khurshid TV, one of the many private channels that have sprung up since 2004.
He makes news and entertainment shows and sometimes recruiting commercials for the Afghan National Army, one of the country’s biggest advertisers.
On weekends, he leaves the dust of the city and tends an apple orchard that he bought in his family’s village.
We met for tea recently in a restaurant called Afghan International Pizza Express.
Nasir wore jeans and a black T-shirt and blazer.
His beard is closely trimmed, in the contemporary style.
Nasir recalled that when Afghanistan’s civil war broke out, in April, 1992, he was an agricultural student at Kabul University.
He was from the sort of secular family that had flourished under the regime of Mohammad Najibullah, the country’s last Communist President.
The Soviet Army had left in 1989, after ten years of fighting the American- and Saudi-backed guerrillas known as the mujahideen.
Najibullah was a charismatic and ruthless leader, but, as the last of the Soviet troops departed, no one gave him much of a chance to remain in power.
The Soviet Minister of Defense figured that Najibullah would last only a few months.
The regime, sustained by a flow of food and ammunition from the Soviet Union, held firm.
The Afghan Army fought well, routing the mujahideen in a decisive battle for the city of Jalalabad.
But in late 1991 the Soviet Union fell apart, leaving Najibullah and his fellow-Communists to fend for themselves.
With their supplies running out, soldiers began to desert the Afghan Army.
On April 17, 1992, Najibullah sought refuge in the United Nations compound in Kabul.
The mujahideen poured into the capital, wild and hollow-eyed after years in the countryside.
At first, the city was calm, there was hardly any fighting,” Nasir recalled.
It took me some time to realize that the city was calm because the militias were busy looting the government buildings.
It took them a few days to get everything.
Kabul imploded: electricity disappeared from the city, police vanished, government services ceased, Kabul University closed.
The mujahideen started grabbing pieces of the city.
Karta Seh, the neighborhood in western Kabul where Nasir grew up, became a no man’s land poised amid three armed groups: Hezb-e-Wahdat, the militia of the Hazara minority, led by Abdul Ali Mazari; Hezb-e-Islami, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a commander famous for his bloodlust; and Jamiat-e-Islami, the army of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was ostensibly part of a new government but who in fact controlled only a handful of Kabul’s neighborhoods.
The border of Hezb-e-Wahdat’s turf, Nasir said, was Darulaman Road, just outside the window of Afghan International Pizza Express.
As an ethnic Pashtun, Nasir had to stay away from the far side of Darulaman Road, where Hezb-e-Wahdat’s territory began.
Some of his Pashtun friends had crossed over and never returned.
Hazaras were killing any Pashtun they could find,” Nasir said.
The militias fought each other continuously, and it was too dangerous to leave the house.
Hezb-e-Wahdat was right here, on the side of this road, and Massoud was just across the street, a hundred metres away,” Nasir said, twisting around in his chair and pointing to a hill overlooking Karta Seh.
He twisted around again, pointing to the west.
The mujahideen were stealing everything—jewelry, cars, bikes.
Some of the Hezb-e-Wahdat fighters crossed into Karta Seh, bursting into Nasir’s family’s house and punching holes through the walls in the neighborhood to create an aboveground tunnel network.
The family had no access to food, and Nasir ached from hunger.
He could venture out only when the militiamen called an occasional ceasefire.
The family held on for a year in Karta Seh, and then, during a lull in the fighting, moved to Nasir’s uncle’s apartment, in a Soviet-built complex called Macroyan, about a mile away.
Macroyan was largely under the control of a fourth group, an Uzbek militia called Junbish-e-Milli, led by a warlord of exceptional brutality named Abdul Rashid Dostum, who had fought for the Soviets.
Massoud’s forces were close by, but the two groups were separated by the Kabul River.
Over the next three years, tens of thousands of Afghans died in the civil war.
From Hekmatyar’s base, outside the city, he rained Scud missiles on Kabul.
The various militias, in a frenzy to mark their territory, carpeted the city with mines.
There were so many mines in Kabul that, in the mid-nineteen-nineties, according to United Nations figures, an average of fifty people per week stepped on them, risking death and terrible injury.
The city’s monuments, great and banal—the Darulaman Palace, the mausoleum of King Nadir Shah, a socialist-realist relic called the Soviet Cultural Center—were blasted and burnt.
In the autumn of 1996, the Taliban, armed and backed by the Pakistani military, reached the outskirts of Kabul.
On its march across the country, the Taliban had vanquished every militia in its path.
All that remained was Massoud’s army, which was still in Kabul.
Around this time, Nasir travelled to his ancestral village, Deh Afghanan, about twenty-five miles west of Kabul, for his wedding day.
The morning of the ceremony, he went to his mother’s grave to pray, and to tell her of his marriage.
Nasir could see the Taliban forces a few hundred yards away.
That day, fighting broke out between the Taliban and Massoud’s forces, and an artillery shell landed in the village, killing five of Nasir’s relatives.
The wedding proceeded, and so did the funerals.
Nasir shared his wedding feast with the grieving family.
It was the saddest and the happiest day of my life,” he said.
Like most people in Kabul, Nasir welcomed the arrival of the Taliban in the city, because they had kicked out the mujahideen and brought peace.
But soon the Taliban took to enforcing their brutal and medieval brand of Islam.
Beards, turbans, television––I was always trying to break the rules,” Nasir said.
Ninety per cent of Afghans have no education, and they didn’t mind the Taliban.
Nasir celebrated the American invasion in 2001, and, in the decade that followed, he prospered, and fathered six children.
But now, with the United States planning its withdrawal by the end of 2014, Nasir blames the Americans for a string of catastrophic errors.
The Americans have failed to build a single sustainable institution here,” he said.
All they have done is make a small group of people very rich.
These days, Nasir said, the nineties are very much on his mind.
Everyone is preparing,” he said.
It will be bloodier and longer than before, street to street.
This time, everyone has more guns, more to lose.
Hezb-e-Wahdat and Jamiat-e-Islami and Hezb-e-Islami and Junbish—all now political parties—are rearming.
The Afghan Army is unlikely to be able to restore order as it did in the time of Najibullah.
It’s a joke,” Nasir said.
I’ve worked with the Afghan Army.
A few weeks ago, Nasir returned to Deh Afghanan.
S.
The Americans have a big base there, and they never go out,” he said.
And, only four kilometres from the front gate, the Taliban control everything.
On a drive to Jalrez, a town a little farther west, Nasir was stopped at ten Taliban checkpoints.
The ethnic battle lines in Afghanistan have not changed.
Pashtuns, who dominate both the government and the Taliban, are from the south; the ethnic minorities—Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, and many others—live mainly in the north.
The capital, Kabul, is multiethnic and the focal point of all political and military ambition.
In April, I drove to Khanabad, a rural district near the city of Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan.
It’s only in the past few months that a Westerner could venture there without protection.
Three years ago, the area around Kunduz fell under the control of the Taliban, who collected taxes, maintained law and order, and adjudicated disputes.
A panel of Taliban imams held trials in a local mosque.
There was an Afghan government in the area, with a governor and a police force, but the locals regarded it as ineffectual and corrupt.
In the fall of 2009, the Americans stepped up their efforts to reinforce the Afghan government.
American commandos swooped into villages almost every night, killing or carrying away insurgents.
Local Taliban leaders—“shadow governors”—began disappearing.
Most of the Taliban governors lasted only a few weeks,” a Khanabad resident, Ghulam Siddiq, told me.
The most effective weapon against the Taliban were people like Mohammad Omar, the commander of a local militia.
Afghan intelligence agency––if he could raise a militia.
It wasn’t hard to do.
Omar’s brother Habibullah had been a lieutenant for Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, one of the leading commanders in the war against the Soviets, and a warlord who helped destroy Kabul during the civil war.
The Taliban had killed Habibullah in 1999, and Omar jumped at the opportunity to take revenge.
Using his brother’s old contacts, he raised an army of volunteers from around Khanabad and began attacking the Taliban.
He set up forces in a string of villages on the southern bank of the Khanabad River.
We pushed all the Taliban out,” he told me.
The Taliban are gone from Khanabad now, but Omar and his fighters are not.
Indeed, Omar’s militia appears to be the only effective government on the south side of the Khanabad River.
Without Omar, we could never defeat the Taliban,” a local police chief, Mohammad Sharif, said.
I’ve got two hundred men.
S.
American Special Forces have set up armed neighborhood groups like Omar’s across Afghanistan.
Some groups, like the Afghanistan Local Police, have official supervision, but others, like Omar’s, are on their own.
Omar insists that he and his men are not being paid by either the Americans or the Afghan government, but he appears to enjoy the support of both.
His stack of business cards includes that of Brigadier General Edward Reeder, an American in charge of Special Forces in Afghanistan in 2009, when the Americans began counterattacking in Kunduz.
The militias established or tolerated by the Afghan and American governments constitute a reversal of the efforts made in the early years of the war to disarm such groups, which were blamed for destroying the country during the civil war.
At the time, American officials wanted to insure that the government in Kabul had a monopoly on the use of force.
Kunduz Province is divided into fiefdoms, each controlled by one of the new militias.
In Khanabad district alone, I counted nine armed groups.
Omar’s is among the biggest; another is led by a rival, on the northern bank of the Khanabad River, named Mir Alam.
Like Omar, Alam was a commander during the civil war.
He was a member of Jamiat-e-Islami.
Alam and his men, who declined to speak to me, are said to be paid by the Afghan government.
As in the nineties, the militias around Kunduz have begun fighting each other for territory.
They also steal, tax, and rape.
I have to give ten per cent of my crops to Mir Alam’s men,” a villager named Mohammad Omar said.
That is the only tax I pay.
When I accompanied the warlord Omar to Jannat Bagh, one of the villages under his control, his fighters told me that Mir Alam’s men were just a few hundred yards away.
We fight them whenever they try to move into our village,” one of Omar’s men said.
None of the militias I encountered appeared to be under any government supervision.
In Aliabad, a town in the south of the province, a group of about a hundred men called the Critical Infrastructure Protection force had set up a string of checkpoints.
Their commander, Amanullah Terling, another former Jamiat commander, said that his men were protecting roads and development projects.
His checkpoints flew the flag of Jamiat-e-Islami.
Terling’s group—like dozens of other such units around the country—is an American creation.
It appears to receive lots of cash but little direct supervision.
Once a month, an American drives out here in his Humvee with a bag of money,” Terling said.
Together, the militias set up to fight the Taliban in Kunduz are stronger than the government itself.
Local officials said that there were about a thousand Afghan Army soldiers in the province—I didn’t see any—and about three thousand police, of whom I saw a handful.
Some police officers praised the militias for helping bring order to Kunduz; others worried that the government had been eclipsed.
We created these groups, and now they are out of control,” Nizamuddin Nashir, the governor of Khanabad, said.
The confrontations between government forces and militias usually end with the government giving way.
When riots broke out in February after the burning of Korans by American soldiers, an Afghan Army unit dispatched to the scene was blocked by Mir Alam’s men.
I cannot count on the Army or the police here,” Nashir said.
He was echoing a refrain I heard often around the country.
Much of the violence and disorder in Kunduz, as elsewhere in Afghanistan, takes place beyond the vision of American soldiers and diplomats.
German, Norwegian, and American soldiers are stationed in Kunduz, but, in the three days I spent there, I saw only one American patrol.
The American diplomats responsible for Kunduz are stationed seventy-five miles away, in a heavily fortified base in Mazar-e-Sharif.
S.
Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, the official did not know the name.
Largely prohibited from venturing outside their compounds, many American officials exhibit little knowledge of events beyond the barricades.
They often appear to occupy themselves with irrelevant activities such as filling out paperwork and writing cables to their superiors in the United States.
Some of them send tweets––in English, in a largely illiterate country, with limited Internet usage.
Captain America ran the half marathon,” a recent Embassy tweet said, referring to a sporting event that took place within the Embassy’s protected area.
In the early years of the war, diplomats were encouraged to leave their compounds and meet ordinary Afghans.
In recent years, personal safety has come to overshadow all other concerns.
S.
The State Department has marginalized itself,” an American civilian working for the military said.
S.
Afghan national-security forces or shut down.
But exactly when and how this will happen is unclear, especially since the Afghan security forces are almost certain to shrink.
That is an Afghan government solution that the coming years will have to determine,” Lieutenant General Daniel P.
Nashir, the Khanabad governor, who is the scion of a prominent family, said that the rise of the warlords was just the latest in a series of ominous developments in a country where government officials exercise virtually no independent authority.
These people do not change, they are the same bandits,” he said.
Nashir grew increasingly vehement.
Mark my words, the moment the Americans leave, the civil war will begin,” he said.
Nashir rattled off the names of some of the country’s best-known leaders—some of them warlords—and the areas they come from: “Mir Alam will take Kunduz.
Atta will take Mazar-e-Sharif.
Dostum will take Sheberghan.
The Karzais will take Kandahar.
The Haqqanis will take Paktika.
In June, 2010, President Hamid Karzai removed General Bismillah Khan Mohammadi from his post as chief of staff of the Afghan Army, and transferred him to the Ministry of Interior.
Khan, an ethnic Tajik, is a former deputy to Ahmad Shah Massoud, the leader of Jamiat-e-Islami, who was killed in 2001.
Jamiat is composed mostly of ethnic Tajiks, a minority in Afghanistan, and the group that held out longest against the Taliban, until the American invasion.
Jamiat’s military commander, Mohammad Fahim, formed the nucleus of the new Afghan Army.
From the beginning, the dominance of the Army by ethnic Tajiks, and, in particular, by members of Jamiat-e-Islami, has been a source of tension with the Pashtuns, Afghanistan’s largest and historically most powerful ethnic group.
The Taliban draw most of their recruits from the Pashtuns; many members of the Afghan government, including President Karzai, are also Pashtun.
According to Afghan and American officials, Karzai decided to remove Bismillah Khan as Army chief over fears that he was packing the middle ranks of the Afghan officer corps with fellow Jamiat officers who might be more loyal to him than to the Afghan state.
This was not a new concern, but it was possibly an urgent one.
According to a survey conducted by an international organization in 2008, roughly seventy per cent of the colonels and generals in the Afghan Army appeared to be loyal to Khan.
Antonio Giustozzi, an Italian researcher who has written extensively on Afghanistan, said.
K.
Americans and the Afghans who are helping to train the Afghan security forces: that under the stress of battle—and without a substantial presence of American combat troops after 2014—the Afghan Army could once again fracture along ethnic lines.
Afghan and American officials believe that some precipitating event could prompt the country’s ethnic minorities to fall back into their enclaves in northern Afghanistan, taking large chunks of the Army and police forces with them.
Another concern is that Jamiat officers within the Afghan Army could indeed try to mount a coup against Karzai or a successor.
The most likely trigger for a coup, these officials say, would be a peace deal with the Taliban that would bring them into the government or even into the Army itself.
Tajiks and other ethnic minorities would find this intolerable.
Another scenario would most likely unfold after 2014: a series of dramatic military advances by the Taliban after the American pullout.
A coup is one of the big possibilities—a coup or civil war,” a former American official who was based in Kabul and has since left the country told me.
It’s clear that the main factions assume that civil war is a possibility and they are hedging their bets.
American officials say that they monitor closely the ethnic composition of the Afghan security forces for any hints of ethnic tension.
The upper ranks of the Afghan Army have been evenly distributed among Pashtuns, Tajiks, and Uzbeks, General Bolger said, and the Army roughly reflects what is believed to be the groups’ share of the population.
A senior Afghan defense official told me that ethnic tensions in the Army are stirring beneath the surface.
The Jamiat people are very unified,” the official said.
They have people at every level of government—in the Army, in the police, in the intelligence services.
K.
Karzai has taken other steps to counter the influence of the Jamiat cabal.
K.
General Sher Mohammad Karimi, an ethnic Pashtun and an American favorite.
General Karimi is charismatic and mercurial.
He worked in the Ministry of Defense under the Communists, is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, and has studied in the United States.
Karimi has set out to dilute the influence of the Jamiat officers and defuse ethnic tensions.
K.
Americans to do it,” the Afghan official said.
American officials say that they also are worried about efforts by the Taliban—and, they assume, the government of Pakistan—to subvert the Afghan military from within.
Several hundred soldiers in the Afghan Army are thought to be agents for the Taliban or for Pakistan, a former American official told me.
The former official said that the killers of some of the twenty-two coalition soldiers who died this year while training Afghan forces had been planted in the Army by the Taliban or by Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan’s main intelligence branch.
In the spring of this year, a relative of an official at the Ministry of Defense was caught trying to smuggle three suicide vests into the building.
The Afghan defense official echoed that concern, saying that there was little vetting of Pashtun recruits, some of whom, he said, were assumed to be loyal to the Taliban or to the Pakistani intelligence services.
We can’t tell which side of the border they are from,” he said.
Since moving to the Ministry of Interior, Bismillah Khan reportedly has continued his covert policy of promoting his allies.

It’s unclear how the police and the militia commanders installed across northern Afghanistan would react if they felt that the government in Kabul was moving against them.
But at least some of those officials appear to be considering the possibility.
Abdul Ali, a police chief in Kunduz and a former Jamiat member, told me that any sort of peace deal that brought the Taliban into the government would be unacceptable.
If the Taliban come into the government, we fight,” he said.
When I asked Ali who his boss was, he replied that it was not Karzai but Mohammad Fahim, the Jamiat commander, who is one of the Vice-Presidents of Afghanistan.
Antonio Giustozzi believes that the moment of maximum danger will come after 2014, when the Americans have all but certainly withdrawn the last of their combat forces.
At that point, the Taliban will likely begin to make substantial territorial gains, particularly in remote areas.
When that happens, parts of the Afghan Army—particularly its Pashtun segments—could dissolve.
I think we lose maybe a quarter or a third of the Army—people will run away,” Giustozzi said.
If the soldiers see a civil war coming, or big Taliban gains on the battlefield, then I think the Army will lose most of the Pashtun troops.
After eleven years, nearly two thousand Americans killed, sixteen thousand Americans wounded, nearly four hundred billion dollars spent, and more than twelve thousand Afghan civilians dead since 2007, the war in Afghanistan has come to this: the United States is leaving, mission not accomplished.
Objectives once deemed indispensable, such as nation-building and counterinsurgency, have been abandoned or downgraded, either because they haven’t worked or because there’s no longer enough time to achieve them.
Afghanistan, is at risk.
By the end of 2014, when the last Americans are due to stop fighting, the Taliban will not be defeated.
A Western-style democracy will not be in place.
The economy will not be self-sustaining.
No senior Afghan official will likely be imprisoned for any crime, no matter how egregious.
And it’s a good bet that, in some remote mountain valley, even Al Qaeda, which brought the United States to Afghanistan in the first place, will be carrying on.
American soldiers and diplomats are engaged in a campaign of what amounts to strategic triage: muster enough Afghan soldiers and policemen to take over a fight that the United States and its allies could not win and hand it off to whatever sort of Afghan state exists, warts and all.
Douglas Ollivant, a former counterinsurgency adviser to American forces in Afghanistan, said.
President Obama and other Western leaders have committed themselves to an “enduring presence” whose main goal will be to insure that the Afghan Army stays together, protects Kabul, and holds critical cities and roads.
The post-2014 American campaign in Afghanistan is likely to be a minimalist, if long-term, enterprise—perhaps ten or fifteen thousand American trainers, pilots, and intelligence officers, as well as Special Forces troops to kill suspected terrorists.
At the moment, the American strategy consists of pushing Afghans into the field, to take over the fighting as quickly as possible.
In practice, that means training Afghan soldiers, training Afghan trainers, and building the places to train them in.
It means equipping more than three hundred and fifty thousand Afghan soldiers and policemen with guns, uniforms, Humvees, barracks, gasoline trucks, food, helicopters, hospitals, and spare parts.
In a country where eighty per cent of the recruits are illiterate, the Americans are teaching tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers to read—at a first-grade level.
The cost of this crash exercise in army-building is around eleven billion dollars a year.
S.
American strategy, despite its myriad failures, is deeply impressive.
In various regions, towns, and cities, there have been inspiring projects and success stories—hospitals, schools, roads.
The effort of the people doing this work is extraordinary, poignant, even superhuman.
The men and women commanding the over-all campaign are smart and committed and self-questioning.
Indeed, some of the early indications are that the strategy is beginning to work: these days, almost half of the military operations that unfold in Afghanistan are led by Afghans.
The majority of all military missions now have Afghan participation.
Sometimes, that participation is minimal: Afghan soldiers might be walking on a patrol through a village in eastern Afghanistan, but that patrol was planned, supplied, and protected by the Americans.
Can the Americans remove themselves entirely from fighting in little more than two years and expect the country to hold together?
Senior American officers have not always been reliable on this question.
In 2010, during the military offensive into the Taliban-held town of Marjah, in southern Afghanistan, American officers insisted that the operation was “Afghan-led,” which was preposterous.
Americans were in charge.
That was cosmetic,” General Lawrence D.
Nicholson, the Marine commander in Marjah at the time, who is now the head of the coalition military operations in the country, told me.
Even now, questions linger about how accurately the progress of the Afghan military is being measured.
S.
Department of Defense said that only one Afghan battalion—about three hundred soldiers—was capable of operating independently.
Less than a year later, after the Americans changed the criteria for evaluating those units, the number of battalions deemed independent leaped to thirteen.
American commanders say they are pushing the Afghans into the fight even when they are at risk of failing.
It’s not unlike raising teen-agers,” Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Taylor told me one night at a base in eastern Afghanistan.
This is Taylor’s fourth combat tour since 2001, including two in Iraq; he has two teen-agers at home.
It may be that American officers, after eleven years of doing almost everything themselves, have created such a sense of dependency in the Afghan government and military that they must now see if their charges will stand on their own.
And maybe they will.
But the American strategy appears to be an enormous gamble, propelled by a sense of political and economic fatigue.
The preparedness of the Afghan Army is only one of the many challenges that are being left unresolved: the Afghan kleptocracy, fuelled by American money and presided over by Hamid Karzai, is being given what amounts to a pass; and the safe havens in Pakistan which allow Taliban leaders and foot soldiers an almost unlimited ability to rest and plan remain open.
After so many years, this is it.
There is no Plan B.
I think it will be close,” a senior American diplomat told me in Kabul.
Early one morning in April, an Afghan police officer on a motorcycle drove up to the gate of the Afghan Army’s base in Kushamond, a barren town fifty miles from the Pakistani border, and yelled for help.
His men were in a firefight with the Taliban, he said, and they needed the Americans to bail them out.
Under the new rules, when members of an Afghan police unit got in trouble, they were supposed to call the Afghan Army—not the Americans.
But the Afghan police told me they had no radios to call either the Afghan soldiers or the Americans.
When the word came, the local Afghan Army commander, Lieutenant Mohammad Qasim, jumped out of bed.
It was still dark; the moon was high.
Then came another problem.
Three of the unit’s Humvees were broken down.
With only two functioning vehicles, Qasim went to the quarters of the presiding American officer, Captain Giles Wright, and woke him up.
Wright said.
He took twenty-one of his men and dashed out the door.
Qasim took twenty of his, crammed them into the two Humvees, and followed Wright.
What was supposed to be an all-Afghan operation quickly had become an American-led one.
By the time Wright and Qasim arrived in the village of Chowray to help Abdul Rehman, the police chief, the Taliban had departed.
We could see them in the distance, watching from motorcycles.
Rehman had left, too, but no one knew where, since there was no way to call him.
We still have some kinks to work out,” Wright told me.
That was just the beginning.
Like the Afghan police, Qasim, the Afghan platoon leader, had no radios.
As he moved on foot toward what he believed to be a Taliban position, Qasim directed his men by whistling, with two fingers in his mouth.
Qasim said, following one of his whistles, waving his hand.
Qasim, along with some other men in his unit, didn’t have a helmet.
When I asked him about it, he shook his head.
Problem,” he said.
There was no electricity or running water on Forward Operating Base Kushamond.
What water there was came from the Americans, in plastic bottles, stacked inside the base.
No one could say how the water would be supplied in two weeks, when the Americans were scheduled to depart.
There were no heavy machine guns, either, nothing larger than a Kalashnikov, which meant that the new patrol base could be outgunned by any Taliban soldier with a grenade launcher.
Remarkably, the Americans had not yet told Qasim that they were leaving.
I will be honest with you—we must have the Americans here,” Qasim said one day over breakfast in his barracks.
Without them, we cannot hold off the Taliban.
Lieutenant Qasim is the embodiment of all that the Americans—and the Afghans—could hope for in an officer.
He is tough and aggressive and smart and relentless, and he’s only twenty-four.
On the foot patrols I went on, Qasim led from the front.
The son of a Pashtun father and a Tajik mother, he represents Afghanistan’s two largest ethnic groups.
He forbade his men from talking about ethnicity.
The Taliban are not very strong, they are easily beaten,” he insisted.
When the executive officer of Qasim’s battalion, Mirwais, visited, Qasim told me it was the first time he’d come to Kushamond.
His brigade commander had never appeared.
It was not difficult to imagine, in the face of a sustained Taliban offensive, the whole operation in Kushamond falling apart.
American officers say that the sort of shortcomings I saw in Kushamond were increasingly exceptional.
They claim that, after I left, the Kushamond base received radios, mortars, heavy machine guns, and a deep-water well.
In Helmand Province, security has largely been handed over to the Afghans, and the number of American marines is dropping from sixteen thousand to six thousand.
In the first four months of this year, bloodshed in Helmand, once the most violent place in the country, has declined seventeen per cent compared with the same period last year.
For all the problems plaguing the Afghan security forces today, the Americans said, they will be ready when the time comes.
Our thought is, Let’s push them out there now and let them make their mistakes while we are still here in great numbers,” General Nicholson, the coalition chief of operations, told me.
Many of the American officers involved in training Afghan soldiers had participated in the similarly ambitious task of training the Iraqi Army from 2004 to 2010.
The Iraqis entering the Army came from a literate society and a state sustained by revenue from oil.
The Iraqi Army was larger and had more resources, but the soldiers I worked with had no integrity, no sense of responsibility, no drive, and no desire to improve the situation, and three months after I left everything we had built went to hell,” Major Shane Carpenter, an adviser to the Afghan Army in Paktika, told me.
The Afghans are under-resourced and undersized, but they are far more professional.
One illuminating example comes from 1989, as the Soviet Union began withdrawing its soldiers.
The mujahideen, suddenly deprived of an enemy, began to quit in droves, making the Afghan Army’s job easier.
The Afghan Army did indeed come apart—but only after three years, and only after the Soviet Union itself collapsed.
Even today, people marvel at the resiliency of the now defunct Afghan Army.
S.
Army.
If the money hadn’t stopped flowing, I firmly believe that the Afghan Army would still be intact today,” Grau said.
S.
Army Web site, Grau and a co-author argue that the challenges faced by the United States in Afghanistan appear to be far smaller than those faced by the Soviet Union in 1989.
Now as then, there is a good bet that Taliban insurgents will start quitting once the United States begins to depart.
The international community—having seen Afghanistan implode once before—also appears to be far more committed to the state’s survival, Grau noted.
And, as grave as America’s economic problems are, Grau pointed out that there is no apparent danger that the United States is going to collapse, as the Soviet Union did.
Still, significant questions about America’s commitment remain, the largest being the future funding of the Afghan Army.
The Afghan state cannot pay for the Army on its own.
The national budget is about four billion dollars a year.
The current costs, borne mostly by the United States, are about eleven billion dollars a year.
Who will pay after 2014?
And how much?
In late 2010, the American military estimated the costs of maintaining the Afghan Army and police at their projected size—three hundred and fifty-two thousand—at about eight billion dollars a year, according to a former American official who served in Kabul.
The Obama Administration resisted that estimate, saying that the costs were too high to expect congressional support, the former official told me.
A White House official confirmed that account, saying that the original estimate was considered too large to be politically feasible.
1 billion.
Shortly afterward, American commanders began calling the three-hundred-and-fifty-two-thousand-man force a “surge” force that would likely shrink.
The new force could be as much as a third smaller.
The fiscal problems in the United States are so severe that we are going to have to take a risk that this will be enough,” the former American official said.
According to current plans, the Afghan security forces will be sustained at current levels until the end of 2014 and are then likely to begin declining.
S.
Afghan Army and police even as they are fighting the Taliban.
As a military guy, I don’t reduce the size of my force until the enemy has been defeated, and not a moment before,” a senior American officer told me.
S.
Americans will leave behind.
By October, 2012, the number of American troops deployed in Afghanistan will be sixty-eight thousand, and General Karimi, the Afghan Army’s chief of staff, told me that he would like those troops to stay on.
Most American officers and officials whom I spoke to expected a far smaller number—closer to fifteen thousand.
Some Western and Afghan experts say that fifteen thousand American troops would not be enough to secure Afghanistan, particularly when it comes to the use of airpower.
The Afghan Air Force is far less advanced than the Soviet-trained force was at a similar moment.
American officers told me that air strikes—bombs and rockets—are usually restricted to units in which Americans direct the fire.
A force of fifteen thousand Americans would probably not be large enough to spread trainers and air controllers throughout the Afghan Army  and not throughout the police, who are at tiny checkpoints scattered around the country .
If they go below thirty thousand, it will be difficult for them to do any serious mentoring, and without the mentors they won’t call in airpower,” Giustozzi, the Italian researcher, said.
American officers have another concern.
Currently, Afghan units are stationed where the Americans are, in hundreds of small bases, mostly in populated areas.
Some American officers say that the Afghans will find it difficult to disperse themselves as fully, because of problems with supplies and communications.
Once the coalition forces leave, those officers say, the Afghans are likely to consolidate their units on bigger and fewer bases.
If that happens, the Afghans could end up ceding large tracts of territory to the Taliban—much as the Afghan Army did after 1989.
On a Friday afternoon in May, Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Taylor, the leader of eight hundred American troops in eastern Afghanistan, arrived at a meeting of the government of Kushamond.
Twenty-four hours earlier, the last of Forward Operating Base Kushamond, a sprawling home to a company of American soldiers, had been bulldozed flat.
All but twenty-five American soldiers had departed, and even they would be leaving soon.
B.
Kushamond is part of the over-all American withdrawal.
B.
Kushamond was a tiny, ill-equipped patrol base for a few dozen Afghan Army soldiers.
Good afternoon, everyone, it’s great to be here,” Taylor said to the local officials.
He’d flown in by helicopter from Sharana, the capital of the largely Pashtun Paktika Province.
The government of Kushamond, arrayed before Taylor, consisted of exactly three people: the governor, Ghulam Khan; the police chief, Abdul Rehman; and a diminutive, soft-spoken man named Abdullah Janikhel, who was calling himself the education minister.
It was Janikhel’s first day on the job.
There was also a young boy, who busied himself distributing glasses and pouring tea.
This was the entirety of the government of Kushamond, an area of two hundred and thirty square miles, with a population of around twenty thousand.
The district center, where the meeting was unfolding, was made up of three bare rooms; the building has been attacked dozens of times by Taliban fighters.
There was no electricity.
We need a lot of help,” Governor Khan told Taylor.
We don’t have heavy weapons.
In eleven years, countless meetings in Afghanistan have begun this way: with a request for aid.
In years past, the American officer in Taylor’s position would have assured Khan that he would receive more money, more guns, more Americans.
Not anymore.
Well, this just shows how important it is for you to coördinate with the Afghan Army,” Taylor told the Governor.
Khan said nothing.
Abdul Rehman, the police chief, spoke up.
He commanded thirty-five police in Kushamond, in a station just down the road.
His men were fighting every day.
We don’t have heavy weapons,” Rehman told Taylor.
You should have more than enough forces to secure the area,” Taylor said.
Just that morning, he pointed out, Rehman and his men had laid an ambush for a group of Taliban fighters.
Today was a great example,” he said.
But we can’t call the American base,” Rehman said.
Taylor nodded.
This is a great topic of discussion at your next meeting with the Afghan Army,” he said.
Rehman stared at Taylor for a moment.
Rehman’s police unit had four Humvees  each costing American taxpayers about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars , and two of them had broken down.
Taylor replied, “I’ve told my commanders that they cannot fix Afghan vehicles.
More silence.
Janikhel, the new education minister, spoke up, in halting English.
The security situation is not good,” he said.
All of the schools have been closed by the Taliban.
Taylor said nothing.
In Kushamond, the schools have been closed for eight years, on account of Taliban intimidation.
We have no materials for the schools,” Janikhel said.
No books.
The doors are broken.
The windows are shattered.
I am trying to open the schools for the children of the area, for the families,” he said, looking up at Taylor.
Taylor, once again, had nothing.
I encourage you to open the schools in the area,” he said.
But, sir,” Janikhel said.
We don’t have security.
I think many people are afraid of an enemy that has been gone for two years,” Taylor replied.
I think you are overestimating how strong the Taliban are,” Taylor said.
Taylor: “I would start small.
Janikhel: “We would like to open a girls’ school.
Taylor: “We just tore down our base.
Janikhel looked stunned.
Rehman, the police chief, and Khan, the governor, stared at each other for a minute and said nothing.
The meeting ended.
Taylor walked outside, glancing at Kushamond’s bazaar.
Forty of its forty-four shops were shuttered because of Taliban threats.
Then he looked up, at the solar-powered street lights that lined the road through the bazaar, another woebegone American project.
Each light had been stripped of its solar panel, its fixtures, its wires.
In some of the panels, birds were building nests.
You have to really admire the people who built those,” Taylor said, shaking his head, and then he climbed into his troop carrier and drove away.
If the Afghan Army can’t hold off the Taliban, then who can?
Since the end of 2010, American officials have been aggressively pursuing a comprehensive peace agreement with the Taliban, and earlier this year the outlines of a preliminary deal emerged.
The Taliban would open an office in the state of Qatar, where some senior Taliban leaders would be allowed to travel.
The Americans would release five high-level Taliban leaders held at Guantánamo, in exchange for the release of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, an American soldier missing since 2009, who is believed to be in Taliban custody.
In May, President Obama publicly raised the possibility of a “negotiated peace” with the Taliban, the group that harbored Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda members as they planned the 9 11 attacks.
On March 15th, the Taliban’s leadership posted a statement on the group’s Web site, announcing that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was suspending talks with the Americans.
S.
We must categorically state that the real source of obstacle in talks was the shaky, erratic, and vague standpoint of the Americans, and therefore all the responsibility for the halt also falls on their shoulders,” it said.
An American official familiar with the negotiations told me that the more likely reason the discussions were suspended was that Taliban leaders were concerned about mobilizing their foot soldiers for the 2012 fighting season.
There was a lot of dissension in the ranks,” the American official told me.
But perhaps the most interesting thing about the statement was the suggestion that the group wants to make a deal.
In a statement, released last year, Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban leader, had said that the Taliban no longer desired a monopoly on power in a post-American Afghanistan—meaning, presumably, that the Taliban would be willing to share power.
This most recent statement went even further, proclaiming that the Taliban had a vision for life after the war.
We also wanted to erase the dull picture of the Islamic Emirate that has been painted and presented to the world by our enemies who dismissed us as a warring faction which has no political, administrative and social capabilities,” it said.
American officials say that they take seriously Omar’s remarks and are not surprised that Taliban leaders want to make a deal.
American military officers say that the increased number of American troops over the past twenty-four months has badly damaged the Taliban.
General Nicholson told me, “There are hardly any Taliban leaders of consequence in this country right now.
They’re terrified to come into this country.
We have harvested so many of their leaders.
Another reason for a peace settlement, according to Americans close to the negotiations, is a desire on the part of Taliban leaders for international recognition as a political group.
I think we have more leverage over them than we thought,” another American official familiar with the talks said.
But the Americans need a deal at least as much as the Taliban do.
One former American official said he does not believe the Afghan Army will be able to hold the country without a peace settlement that removes a significant number of Taliban fighters from the field.
Without a deal, the Taliban need only hold on for thirty more months, after which the last of the American combat forces will be gone.
This may explain why the Taliban leaders are staying in Pakistan—not because they are afraid of being killed but because they are waiting for the United States to leave.
They’re just going to run out the clock,” the former American official who had served in Kabul told me.
There is another problem with a peace settlement: even the prospect of a deal with the Taliban is causing deep unease among the leaders of the country’s minority groups—among them the members of Jamiat-e-Islami, who dominate large sections of the Afghan Army.
They fear that Karzai and the Americans could bring the Taliban back into power without insisting that they lay down their arms.
In that case, the Taliban would be given effective control over the eastern and southern regions of Afghanistan, where they enjoy the most public support.
S.
Taliban, such a deal could possibly create the conditions for civil war.
If the Taliban are left armed and recognized as the legitimate controllers of the south, that means the partition of Afghanistan,” Amrullah Saleh, one of the leaders of the anti-Karzai opposition and a former member of Jamiat-e-Islami, told me.
For six years, Saleh served in Karzai’s Cabinet, as the director of intelligence.
We are obeying this government because it was sort of anti-Taliban,” Saleh told me.
If it becomes pro-Taliban, we topple it.
One political change that might prevent civil war, some opposition leaders say, would be the imposition of a federal system in which power would devolve to the provinces.
Such a move could essentially cede dominion to the Taliban in the south and the east but protect the rest of the country.
In 2004, when the new Afghan constitution was ratified, under American supervision, the central government, in Kabul, was given extraordinary powers, including the right to appoint local officials.
The hope then was that a strong central government would unite the country.
If a federal system were to be adopted, some Afghan leaders say, it might matter less to the Tajiks and other minorities if the Taliban were allowed to govern Pashtun provinces in the south and the east.
As it is, many of the most prominent leaders of Afghanistan’s minority groups appear to be preparing for civil war.
You do not wake up one morning and the radio says it’s civil war,” Saleh told me.
The ingredients are already there—under the very watchful nose of the government and the armed militias loyal to the men who operate them.
Under the very watchful eyes of the international community.
Under the very watchful eyes of the whole world.
After years of stalemate, Americans wonder what eleven years of war in Afghanistan have achieved.
In Afghanistan, this question is heard less often, even among Afghans who believe it’s time for the Americans to leave.
Real achievements are not hard to find in Afghanistan.
Take, for example, the province of Bamiyan, a mountainous region in the center of the country.
It was here, in March, 2001, that the Taliban, in the high fever of their zealotry, demolished two magnificent statues of the Buddha that had been carved out of the rock escarpments of the Hindu Kush, fourteen hundred years before.
The Taliban carried out some of their worst atrocities in Bamiyan, singling out the Hazara minority for its adherence to the Shiite branch of Islam.
In January, 2001, Taliban fighters massacred dozens of young Hazara men in the villages around the town of Yakawlong.
S.
Bamiyan, and almost no poppy trade—factors that go hand-in-hand in the south and the east.
The lack of violence has allowed economic development, and the growth of a civil society, to flourish more or less unhindered.
Like few other groups in the country, the Hazaras have seized on the educational opportunities offered in post-2001 Afghanistan; Hazara girls have one of the highest high-school graduation rates in the country, and Hazara women have become some of the most visible symbols of the new Afghanistan.
In 2009, when President Karzai endorsed a family law that allowed marital rape in Shiite families, Hazara women led unprecedented protests in the streets of Kabul.
We don’t burn schools here, we don’t have an insurgency,” Habiba Sarabi, the governor of Bamiyan since 2005, told me.
Sarabi is a pharmacist and the only female governor in the country.
In 1996, when the Taliban entered Kabul, Sarabi fled to Pakistan, determined to give her daughter, Naheed, an education, which the Taliban prohibited.
Today, Naheed Sarabi has a master’s degree in development management and works as an adviser in the Ministry of Finance in Kabul.
I am afraid of these negotiations—I am afraid we will be abandoned again by the West,” Sarabi told me.
If the United States does not fix these problems, then the Taliban will return.
Just down the road from Sarabi’s office, I met a woman named Saleha Hosseini.
On a snowy spring day eleven years earlier, Hosseini was taking a chemistry exam in the Yakawlong Girls School when Taliban trucks rumbled into the schoolyard.
The men dismounted and set the school on fire.
Hosseini and the other girls ran away and didn’t go to school for nearly a year.
When the Taliban were routed from Yakawlong, Hosseini went back to class.
Today, she is the principal of a girls’ school just down the street from the Governor’s office.
The Niswan School for Girls has no electricity or running water, but two hundred girls and women, ranging in age from six to twenty-three, come to study each morning.
I will never forget those days,” Hosseini told me during a break from classes.
Most of the girls at the Niswan school were too young to remember the Taliban.
Taliban—have come to permeate their conversations, to permeate their lessons.
In an English-language class, Mohammad Bakhtiari stood in front of his pupils and discussed the architecture of the language: sentence structure, the formation of paragraphs, the conjugation of verbs.
Then, as the class was winding down, Bakhtiari posed a question in English.
Class,” he said, “does Afghanistan have a bright future?
The class ended.
The girls closed their books and filed out of the room.
The teacher’s question would have to wait for another day.

Afghanistan, and for a conflict that’s been seemingly forgotten by most Americans who’ve grown weary of war, it seems fitting that the anniversary should be overshadowed by a domestic story: the federal government shutdown.

Operation Enduring Freedom on Oct.
7, 2001, there are still 54,000 American troops in Afghanistan.
That is more, by far, than at any time during the first seven years of the war, yet these days, they garner scant news coverage.
Most recently, Syria’s civil war and the use of chemical weapons as well as the federal government shutdown have buried Afghanistan news, even as Americans continue to die — four were killed within a week in so-called insider attacks just at the end of September.

Afghanistan as of Oct.
1, according to The Associted Press — more than during any of the first six years of the war.
The military is whittling forces down to approximately 34,000 by February and the number of coalition bases has gone from a high of 800 to about 100 now.

Following the Sept.

Taliban, who had sheltered the al-Qaida terrorists responsible for the attacks.

Pakistan.
After several years of relative calm following then-President George W.
S.
Iraq — the Taliban regrouped.
They mounted a violent and effective guerrilla campaign that eventually pushed President Barack Obama to increase troop levels, sending a “surge” of 30,000 additional troops to the country in 2009.
Despite the surge, though, the Taliban remain entrenched, inflicting heavy casualties on Afghan forces — who have largely taken over security responsibilities from coalition forces — with little more than a year to go before all international troops are scheduled to leave.
Afghanistan is a topic seldom mentioned by the White House, and with public support for the military mission there having crumbled in the past few years, it’s easy to see why.
President Obama talks about Afghanistan strategy maybe only once in a year,” Majidyar said.
A White House spokesman declined to discuss whether Obama is avoiding public discussion of Afghanistan, instead issuing a statement about negotiations over a bilateral security agreement to keep American troops in Afghanistan past the end of 2014.
Media interest in the war has been waning for years, driven by Obama’s silence on the issue since the end of his troop surge, said A.
Trevor Thrall, a professor at George Mason University and the author of War in the Media Age, which explores the intersection of the military, media and public opinion in conflicts since the Vietnam War.
Thrall said it isn’t the first time a president has tried to bury news about Afghanistan.
Bush stopped talking about Afghanistan almost immediately after he shifted focus to Iraq,” he said.
Afghanistan was truly a forgotten war  when  Obama took over and it became it again after the surge was over.
In 2010, during the surge, it was hard for a reporter to find a cot at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan, with journalists from around the world packed tightly into a tent that served as a media center, even battling over access to electrical outlets.
Now, it’s rare that embedded reporters even need to share a room at a major base.
NATO is handing more responsibility to Afghan forces.

Ray Odierno, the former top military commander in Iraq, said the lack of public awareness worries him because international engagement is key to sustaining gains made in Afghanistan.
If we continue on this  path, I think Afghanistan can become a success story, and I worry that’s not being talked about at all,” he said.
Afghanistan was considered the “good war” with the just cause, the one everyone could get behind.
With its clear links to the 9 11 attacks, as opposed to Iraq’s, based as it was later learned on faulty intelligence, the war in Afghanistan was much more popular at first, Majidyar said.
Because of this, though, it also never generated the attention — or the outrage — of the Iraq war, which led to worldwide protests and heated debates of a kind never seen in relation to Afghanistan.
But now, many see Afghanistan as the foreign policy guest that has long overstayed its welcome.
America and its Western allies have gone from war fatigue to numbness.
Public ambivalence about Afghanistan stems in part from the failures of the past few years, which, despite the surge of foreign troops, saw a sharp rise in casualties; violence remained above the pre-surge levels after the additional forces left, Smith said.
The short attention span of the West is such that if the problem hasn’t been solved by now, maybe they figure it’s unsolvable, which is too bad because I think what Afghanistan needs right now is continued engagement,” Smith said.
Smith, who, as a reporter with the Toronto Globe and Mail was the only Western reporter living in the violent southern city of Kandahar, said the relative calm seen today in that city, the Taliban’s spiritual homeland, shows the stakes of continued international involvement and the fragile state of military gains.
Right now, the Afghan military and local militias, known as Afghan Local Police, have the city and surrounding area fairly secure, but the salaries for those fighters are paid for entirely by foreign funds.
Smith said that recently, some local commanders have complained that they haven’t been getting paid.
Troops still serving in Afghanistan have mixed feelings about the lack of attention.
It’s kind of sad, because I think some people are a little more occupied with the latest TV show,” said Lt.

Mike Toole, a member of III Corps based in Kabul, said he understands the dwindling interest back home.
After 12 years, people are going to get tired of it,” he said.

Afghanistan for another 2 ½ years.
When Congress voted to authorize the war way back in 2001, they surely didn’t know they were authorizing a 15-year occupation.
Sen.
Jeff Merkley  D-OR  has a bill calling for a congressional vote on any US troop presence in Afghanistan after 2014.
While it’s encouraging that the administration is reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan and setting a clear timeline for withdrawal, it’s not good enough.
9,800 troops is 9,800 too many, and we need our tax dollars here at home.
Our friends in the House tried to bring up a similar amendment last week, but the Republican leadership was too afraid to watch the antiwar sentiment play out on the floor and blocked a vote.
We need to turn to the Senate now and demand an end to this war by the end of this year.

Las Vegas Township Judge Jansen will soon decide whether activists who trespassed onto the Creech Air Force Base are not guilty because they acted out of necessity.
The Creech 14 entered the base to protest its role in operating unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, over Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, which have killed hundreds of civilians.
1   Likewise, anti-war demonstrators represented by Guild attorney Larry Hildes in Tacoma, WA argued the necessity of using their bodies to block Stryker vehicles returning from Iraq to be repaired at Fort Lewis.
These cases demonstrate how Guild members can breathe life into international law to support the anti-war movement and deepen criticism for wars that steal resources from our communities and needlessly destroy lives.
S has turned against the war in Afghanistan, but we need to galvanize that opposition by continuing to educate and mobilize.
Though President Obama has frequently spoken of “renewing our commitment” to international law, he escalated military action in Afghanistan.
The invasion of Afghanistan has been illegal from its inception, contrary to conventional wisdom that the horrific crimes of 9 11 and the Taliban’s “safe haven” for Al Qaeda justified full-scale war.

The UN Charter prohibits the use and threatened use of any force in member states’ international relations; states must settle their disputes by peaceful means.
It prohibits the use of force to topple foreign governments.
Article 2 of the Charter prohibits the use or threatened use of forces against another state.
The Article 2 prohibition applies to all force and is a rule of customary international law.
Bush Jr.
UN Security Council to get a resolution authorizing the use of military force against Afghanistan and Al Qaeda.
He failed.
You have to remember that.
This war has never been authorized by the United Nations Security Council .
Article 51 of the Charter, which defines member states’ right of self-defense, does not create any right to make retaliatory attacks or to engage in the use of force to repel anticipated armed attacks.
Former Guild President Marjorie Cohn explains that Operation Enduring Freedom was not legitimate self-defense under the Charter because the 9 11 attacks were crimes against humanity, not armed attacks by another country.

6   President Bush stretched traditional notions of self-defense by assigning the Taliban regime responsibility based on “harboring” Osama bin Laden and his operation.
Not only was the war unjustified, but there is mounting factual evidence that the war is “demonstrably criminal in its execution,” says Canadian military veteran John McNamer.
