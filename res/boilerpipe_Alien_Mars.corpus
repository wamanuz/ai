We already know that the spiders from Mars are real -- but has the NASA rover Curiosity picked up real evidence of extraterrestrial life on the Red Planet?
Conspiracy theorists think so.
Some of these photos -- taken by the Curiosity over the past year and on other missions to Mars -- look a lot like rocks.
Some of them look a lot more peculiar, like the  iguana  found earlier this month.
All of them are the stuff of Internet legend, and many believe that NASA is hiding something.
Take a look, and wage alien war on the topic in the comments below.
Oh, NASA rover Curiosity, you make us so curious.
Curious about images like this, which appear to show either camouflaged or fossilized lizards running around on Mars.
A blogger caught this image, what do you think?
OK, this really does look like some sort of rodent.
NASA s Mars rover Curiosity shot a photo of this little guy earlier this year.
But after a closer look, and a little common sense, it s probably a rock.
The rock rats and rock lizards have begun to breed.
Oh no.
It s too late.
The rock rat lizards are already here.
The Internet has long been crazy about this photo, snapped by the NASA rover Spirit.
She has a terrible choice in dress color though, doesn t she?
The conspiracies go back to July 25, 1976, when this shot of the  Face on Mars  was taken by an orbiter.
Do you believe yet?
Awwww.
These are real photos taken of Mars  surface.
But were they designed by extraterrestrials who know the human concept of love?
Only the ETs know.
If it s a skull, it appears to have several eye sockets, a nose, and an embarrassingly large forehead.
If it s a rock, it s probably not even a rock.
LOBSTER!

A former US Marine has claimed he spent 17 years of his career on MARS.
The ex-naval infantryman, who uses the pseudonym Captain Kaye, says he was posted to the Red Planet to protect five human colonies from indigenous Martian life forms.
He claims he then spent nearly three years serving in a secret  space fleet  run by a multinational organisation called the Earth Defense Force, which recruits military personnel from countries including the US, Russia and China.
In testimony released to ExoNews TV, Captain Kaye said he was trained to fly three different types of space fighters and three bombers.
He added that training took place on a secret moon base called Lunar Operations Command, Saturn’s moon Titan, and in deep space.

More than two years into the Curiosity rover’s lonely trek across Mars, conspiracy theorists believe they’ve struck gold: an ‘alien thigh bone’ has been spotted on the surface of the red planet.
For keen alien hunters, the image above - taken by the rover’s MastCam on August 14 – is proof that large animals once roamed Mars, possibly even dinosaurs.
Simply put this shows that there were some living things on the Mars  sic ,” asserts an anonymous editorial writer at Northern Voices Online , while the popular site UFO Blogger compares the find to previous images of a “ fossilized, reptilian spine ” and a “ human finger ”.
The regularity of these ‘finds’ is of course testament not to the once-flourishing wildlife of Mars, but to the human brain’s remarkable capacity to spot patterns in random noise.
This was a handy trait for our ancestors when identifying a potential predator among the primeval foliage, but in modern times it’s more likely to lead only to those little ‘huh’ moments when we spot a face in some inanimate object .
Of course, there is some truth to conspiracy theorists’ hopes of life on Mars, with scientists pointing out last year that the asteroid impact that killed of the dinosaurs could have flung rocks carrying organic matter to the red planet some 66 million years ago.
Unfortunately, at this point  and for roughly 3 billion years prior  Mars was a barren place with no flowing water.
However, if the microorganisms from Earth had hitched a ride to somewhere a little more hospitable, like Europa then it could be a different matter altogether .
Homebase has announced the closure of one in four of its stores.
The  thigh bone  that was found on Mars is not what it appears to be.
NASA says that the photo of what appears to be Martian fossils is just weathered rock.
NASA s Curiosity rover captured a photo on Mars that went viral after appearing on a UFO blog.
The image shows fragments on Mars  dirt surface, one particular elongated rock resembling a leg bone.
The media picked up news of the potential evidence and concluded that there is life on other plants, which led to NASA to officially provide an explanation.
No bones about it!
NASA writes .
NASA s photo description is a disappointment to fans of extraterrestrials, but this is not the first time people thought there was proof of life on Mars.
Astronomers in the 1800s reported seeing canals from telescope views.
Shadow and light in a photo that was taken on the Red Planet made it look like there was a  Face on Mars  in 1976.
The Curiosity rover found concrete evidence that Mars was once habitable; however, no creatures were big enough to leave any fossilized remains.
If life ever existed on Mars, scientist expect that it would be small simple life forms called microbes,  NASA officials writes in the photo description.  Mars likely never had enough oxygen in its atmosphere and elsewhere to support more complex organisms.
All photos captured by Curiosity are available for free online.
In February, a rock suddenly appeared in previously empty ground close to the rover Opportunity.
Many believe that alien life moved the rock.
NASA says that Opportunity s wheels had kicked up the rock as it traveled.
A strange light could be seen in an image Curiosity shot back in April.
The lights in the photo appear to be coming from an artificial source.
This was linked to lighting effects from the sun beaming off of rocks.
The two-metre-wide rock was discovered by the Martian robot on May 25.
It was photographed using the nuclear-powered tank s Chemistry and Camera  ChemCam  instrument.
Curiosity s Mast Camera  Mastcam  was used to determine the body s color and contrast levels.
Now NASA has published the combined image and a preliminary analysis of what the meteorite is made from.
The imaging shows angular shaped cavities on the surface of the rock.
It s not the first meteorite found on Mars.
Back in 2005 the Opportunity rover found an iron nickel extraterrestrial boulder lying on a sand dune on its path, but wasn t able to do much in the way of testing; NASA ended up halting the attempt after a quarter of the rover s drill was worn away by the rock.
As for the Lebanon find, NASA says it is likely the space rock has been sitting on the Martian plains for millions of years.
Iron meteorites are eroded much more slowly on Mars than on Earth, thanks to Earth s oxygen-rich atmosphere and overall moistness, while on the Red Planet the only erosive forces that we know about come from wind-blown dust.
The space agency may decide to investigate the meteorite further, but at least one person has a good idea for the lump of big iron.
Just have to smelt this down and then I can make a sword and then basically I m a samurai.

A new photograph from NASAâ€™s Mars Curiosity rover appears to showcase a strong artificial light emanating from the planetâ€™s surface, igniting speculation that the beacon suggests there is intelligent life on the Red Planet.
The photo in question was taken on April 3 by Curiosityâ€™s   right-hand navigation camera, and shows what looks an awful lot   like a bright, shining light off in the distance.
NASA itself has   not commented on the nature of the light, but UFO watchers have   wasted no time suggesting itâ€™s not natural and, therefore, a sign   of alien life.
This could indicate there there is intelligent life below   the ground and uses light as we do,  Scott Waring wrote on   his UFO Sightings Daily website.  This is not a glare from   the sun, nor is it an artifact of the photo process.
Look closely   at the bottom of the light.
Sure NASA could go and investigate it, but hey, they are not   on Mars to discover life, but there to stall its discovery,â€� he concluded.
Others arenâ€™t quite convinced.
The editor of All About Space   magazine, Ben Biggs, told The Daily Mail that people shouldnâ€™t be   leaping to such dramatic conclusions so quickly.
While the â€˜lightâ€™ is as yet unexplained, it s quite a leap   to assume that it has an intelligent source,â€� he said.
The public can afford to speculate wildly but NASA is an   organization internationally renowned for credible science.
Although NASA has yet to release a statement, Doug Ellison of the   agencyâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory dismissed the idea that the   light was proof of intelligent life.
On Twitter, he told NBC News   the beacon is a â€œcosmic ray hit,â€� noting that there is   no light on the image taken by the left-hand navigation camera,   which was also captured at the exact same moment.
0yle It s not in the     left-Navcam image taken at the exact same moment.
It s a cosmic     ray hit.
Dr.
Chris Bridges of the Surrey Space Center, meanwhile,   concurred, saying it was a â€œgalactic cosmic rayâ€� hitting   the camera.
0yle @AstroKatie @MarsCuriosity Most     likely a galactic cosmic ray  GCR  hitting the imager.
This area is known for having an intersecting section   of four different rocks, and the rover will scheduled to drill   into and analyze the rocks for signs that the planet could have   harbored life in the past.

Hey everyone.
4?
Another possibility is growing rocks.
Rocks that are living creatures, but not like we know them to be.
Rwanda spoke about his experience during his Apollo 20 mission.
He said he saw yellow living rocks on the abandoned cigar shaped UFO in Deporte crater on the moon.

This is one of the most interesting set of Mars photos we have access to.
I d like to see those we don t have access to!
I m sure there are many even more interesting ones!
To me though this looks even like someone has actually been scuffling carelessly around the site here, and couldn’t quite remember where everything was before he she kicked it!
Or didn t have the time to double check everything properly.
Obviously I m stretching credibility here.
Or am I?
Not only does this object move, but there seem to be many stones and rocks  out of place , around this spot, if you look at the different photos.
Including the two you mention but also others.
Or another possibility, could the moving object itself have dislodged these other stones and rocks?
My only slight difference of opinion here with you Scott, is that the moving object doesn t look like any kind of animal or duck like bird to me.
Though I do agree it could well be.
But it simply looks like a moving rock to me, which is why I wonder if it s more likely if it could have been  placed  in the different positions?
The rock with the crack is also very interesting.
Note that it seems to have a sort of tail!
And this  tail  also appears to change its position in the different photos.
It even looks metallic.
A metallic object.
Fascinating.
What indeed is going on here?
To me it seems that there are pics from different angles though.
This obviously has to be taken into account.
At one point of studying this I thought the apparent moving  object  could simply be not an object, but the concave depression sloping away from the rocks, giving the illusion of being an object when in fact it was a depression in the ground.
Appearing so because of the changing shadows, ie.
But further study seems to rule this out also.
As no other shadows change anything like so much.
I ve started checking your site, Scott because of the various interesting posts you keep coming up with.
You work hard.
It s greatly appreciated.
He also posts similar articles to this, though his site is less UFO orientated.
Yes I think this black creature is an animal.
I just checked and its still there, don t worry.
You might want to have 3 different types of web browsers on hand in case one has a  flash,  problem.
It happens to me sometimes.
I have five browsers.
And hey, thanks.
Glad you liked it.
Sure wish we could get the use of a rover for a few weeks to chase after some of these discoveries.

Hi, my name is Scott C.
Waring and I wrote a few books and am currently a ESL School Owner in Taiwan.
I have had my own UFO sighting up close and personal, but that s how it works right?
A non believer becomes a believer when they experience their first sighting.
You witnessed it, your perceptual field changes, so now you need to share it.
I created this site to help the UFO community get a little bit organized.
I noticed that there was a lot of chaos when searching for UFO sighting reports, so I hope this site helps.
I wanted to support those eyewitnesses who have tried to tell others about what they have seen, yet were laughed at by even closest of friends.
More and more each day the governments of the world leak bits and pieces of UFO information to the public.
They have a trickle down theory in hopes of slowly getting citizens use to the idea that we are not alone in universe and never have been.
The truth is being leaked drop by drop until one day we look around and find ourselves neck high in it.
The discovery of alien species in existence is the most monumental scientific event in human history, suppression of that information is a crime against humanity.

There are simple explanations for bright spots seen in two recent photos from Mars.
Bright lights, like the one seen here  upper left , appear in images sent from NASA s Mars rover Curiosity nearly every week.
They could be caused by the glint of sunlight on rocks or by cosmic rays hitting the rover s light detector.
Recent photos taken by NASA s Mars rover might appear to show a gleaming alien bonfire burning in the distance—at least according to some Internet loonies—but that s not exactly what s happening.
Fact is, there still isn t any evidence for life on Mars.
None.
The provocative, shiny smears of light appear in two images snapped by rover Curiosity s navigation camera , one on April 2 and the other on April 3, provoking excitement among some in the UFO-spotting crowd.
The photos come courtesy of the camera s right eye and show nearly vertical bright smudges emerging from a spot near the horizon.
Photos of the same spot shot by the camera s left eye, meanwhile, show no such things .
Rather than emanating from an underground Martian disco, the bright spots are probably caused by cosmic rays colliding with the rover s camera or by glinting rocks reflecting the Martian sunlight, said NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory s Justin Maki , lead imaging scientist for the Curiosity team.
He said that glimmers appearing in similar spots on two consecutive days are oddly coincidental.
It turns out that both cosmic rays and glinting rocks are pretty common on Mars.
They ve been spotted before.
Such rocks have been seen in images sent by several of NASA s Mars rovers, and cosmic rays appear in images that Curiosity sends to Earth each week.
Maki said that one percent of those hundreds of weekly images might include cosmic ray-induced bright spots.
But the junked-up pixels normally don t cause much of a stir.
You ll see cosmic rays every two or three days.
Maki said.
Cosmic rays are charged particles that fly through the universe in every direction all the time.
Every so often they ll collide with something like a camera.
One sign of a cosmic ray hit, Maki said, is the appearance of the ray in images taken by one of Curiosity s eyes but not the other.
Glinting rocks, on the other hand, could easily reflect Martian sunlight.
But it s not clear why the glimmer would appear just in the right-eye images, Maki said.
He notes that one of the left-eye images is obscured, and he says it s not impossible for a glimmer to show up on only one side.
Maki said.
No matter how much we might want our planetary next-door neighbor to host some form of life  let s face it, the solar system would feel a lot less lonely , there s still no evidence for anything living on the red planet.
Of course, that doesn t stop some folks from believing.
Waring wrote, referring to the bright spots.
The image then made its way around the Internet , prompting explanations from NASA scientists and some wild lay speculation about Martian life.
Finding a Martian bonfire would obviously be spectacular.
So would seeing a giant, artificial face on Mars , uncovering alien fossils that hitchhiked to Earth aboard a piece of ejected red planet, or discovering that a shiny, doughnut-shaped rock found by NASA s rover Opportunity is actually alive.
But none of these recent Internet memes are true.
Follow Nadia Drake on Twitter .
Every thing they find is a rock or wind,  in my hole life I ve never seen rock that looks like a bone or a rat and so on.
First of all, I don t think it s smart to call people loonies just because they are considering that the source of the light could be aliens.
Oh, and you re wrong, there was life detected on Mars years ago, by an approved NASA experiment, however it was down played because there other experiments didn t find the same thing.
Many scientists now think that experiment gave good results and want to repeat the experiment.
It involved placing a food source just under the surface, and if any microbes began  to eat it, they would emit tiny amounts of methane, which would then be detected, well guess what, it happened, after about 40 minutes they started detecting the methane, which could mean only one thing, life!
Second of all, you speak of possible life on Mars as if it s a far out idea, well why then are we spending all this money on rovers to look for it?
In the case of this theory that because the light source was detected by only one eye of the camera, and the other eye detected no light at all, it s a fact that the two eye s pictures were seconds apart, so there is a possibility that the light was a flash coming from underground, but by the time the other eye took it s picture it had already gone out.
About the light glinting off of a rock, come on, are you serious?
In two different pictures I believe on two different days from two different places, the light appeared again in the same spot.
Here s an excerpt from your piece  He  Justin Maki  said that glimmers appearing in similar spots on two consecutive days are oddly coincidental.  Oddly coincidental indeed, like maybe it really happened.
Why do they write evidence like this off instead of investigating further?
If it s truly their mission to find life, why do they constantly try to find explanations why it can t be, instead of following up on it just in case they are wrong, that is a possibility you know.
These  loonies  are paying for this too by the way, maybe they deserve a little more respect, and maybe NASA should do what it s there to do instead of dismissing any evidence they find with these far out theories of what else it must be.
It seems to me that NASA needs an attitude change if it really wants to find life, because when you are trying to find something, you first have to actually look.
Oh dont forget, we come in peace!
How about a icy geiser plume like on some other planets moons?
The tiny geiser erupts, the sun hits it just right and the rover snaps a picture.
Can you disprove water ice under the sufface of MARS?
Just drive over and check the lights out , you are named Curiosity for a reason.
So what, and actually the martian microbes hitching a ride on a meteor is still a valid scientific concept.
No rational person thinks this is a bonfire, that is just a ploy, to deny that there is anything unusual at all there.
The actual  meme  was that martians were using light the way humans do, ie with technology such as electricity etc.
Because the explanations offered don t hold water.
It can t be a cosmic ray, and if that is a glint, I am farmer brown.
Appearing in the same EXACT spot means it is not cosmic rays.
Even the word  similar  is a deception.
Rover tracks or what?
It turns out that both cosmic rays and glinting rocks are pretty common  on Mars.
They ve been spotted before.
Problem solved.

The Yip Yips may actually be from Mars too; however since they have a bumper sticker on their flying saucer that says  Mars  on it, this more likely indicates that they were in fact tourists to the planet.
Even so, they are often referred to as  Martians , even by staff crewing them.

NASA has announced that the next Mars rover — currently codenamed Mars 2020 — will be outfitted with an array of sophisticated, upgraded scientific instruments that will let it delve deeper and farther than Curiosity, with the hope that it will be able to uncover signs of life on Mars.
Perhaps even more excitingly, Mars 2020 will also be equipped with a new instrument that can convert the carbon dioxide in Mars’ atmosphere into oxygen — this is of utmost importance if humanity ever colonizes Mars — and another instrument that will gather and store Martian rock samples for eventual return to Earth.
If you haven’t followed the Mars 2020 story, I suggest you read our original story detailing the scientific scope of the mission .
In short, though, the Mars 2020 rover — which is targeting a 2020 launch date — will look almost identical to Curiosity and will land on Mars in the same crazy-sky-crane way .
The idea is to reduce R&D costs and capitalize on the massive success of Curiosity by using most of the same framework — but landing in a different spot, and equipping the rover with better different instrumentation.
Mars rover Curiosity takes a selfie.
The Mars 2020 rover will look almost identical to Curiosity.
At a press conference at its headquarters in Washington DC, NASA announced the seven scientific instruments that “won” a place on the Mars 2020 rover, beating out 51 other proposals.
To be honest, most of the seven instruments are just upgraded versions of what’s currently on Curiosity — higher resolution cameras, more detailed X-ray imaging, etc.
The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment  MOXIE  will produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, which is predominantly carbon dioxide  CO2 .
ISRU stands for “in-situ resource utilization” — a concept that, to feasibly explore and colonize other planets, we must be able to manufacture or harvest important materials  water, oxygen, food  from other planets, rather than shipping everything from Earth.
If MOXIE can produce oxygen on Mars, that oxygen could then be used as fuel to get a spacecraft back to Earth — a much, much cheaper and safer option than trying to land a spacecraft that’s still loaded with enough fuel for the return journey.
MOXIE will attempt to produce about 20 grams of oxygen per hour for around 50 hours, probably using the reverse water-gas shift reaction  CO2 + H2 -> CO + H20  and then electrolysis of the resulting water to produce oxygen.
This method will require a small amount of hydrogen to be shipped from Earth to fuel the reaction, but this is a lot lighter than the alternative of shipping lots of oxygen.
The Radar Imager for Mars’ Subsurface Exploration  RIMFAX  is a ground-penetrating radar that can provide centimeter-scale imaging of the  hopefully  interesting geological features below the Martian surface, such as groundwater… or massive microbial colonies.
We don’t yet have any numbers on how deep RIMFAX can penetrate, but presumably it’ll be at least a couple of feet.
Other notable features of the Mars 2020 rover include: a new drill that can dig deeper  where microbes could still be living today , a UV laser spectrometer  amusingly called SHERLOC , and a very-high-res SuperCam.
Finally, the Mars 2020 rover will also have the ability to store up to 30 Martian rock and soil samples that could eventually be returned to Earth for analysis.
There’s no word on how these samples will get back to Earth, but presumably it would involve a manned mission to Mars  NASA has indicated that it would like to put humans on Mars by 2035  .
While Mars 2020 will have some capabilities that allow it to look for signs of life, our tools here on Earth are much better suited to the task.
All told, the Mars 2020 rover is a very exciting prospect indeed.
NASA’s inclusion of MOXIE and the sample-return cache indicate that the space agency is taking manned visits to the Red Planet rather seriously.
In the shorter term, Mars 2020 could tell us definitively if life has ever lived on Mars — and potentially, whether life is still living below the Martian surface.
Start working from home!
Why can’t the convert CO2 directly to O2  CO2 -> C + O2 .
Isn’t there any way to do this yet?
Could be so simple as using a plant?
Plants convert  H20  +  CO2  >  CH2O  +   O2 .
Oxygen.
I’m sure that there might be a way to perform the reaction you said  none that i’m aware of , but it would require a lot more power than the rover would have.
NASA?
5 billion?
5 billion and I’ll find out.
5 billion per year.
5 Billion is the amount which the actual Mars Science Laboratory project cost over the course of 7 years  2004 – 2011 , and that number doesn’t even include the cost of continued communications with the rover as it fulfills missions on Mars.
Still think you’d “find out”?
Joel give me that money.
DC, your idiocy astounds me, some of the most important scientific advancements in the world have stemmed from NASA research.
Also can you not open your mind and see the bigger picture, the progression of human race, the adventure of exploration, no I suppose you cant.
I said I’d be happy to give it a try.
You just can’t accept private industry exploring space.
You need to open your mind.
Your idiocy astounds me.
LMAO.
The wheels are a problem on curiosity.
What are they doing to 2020 to fix those?
Yeah, I’m sure they’ll re-engineer them.
They’ll probably get rid of the Morse code patterns, which made them weaker  and gave sharp rocks a perfect attack vector .
Someone should probably inform the media arts dept @ JPL about the benefits of YouTube custom thumbnails.
I’m sure Ms.
Allwood would appreciate it.
Who took the picture?
I do not see any arm holding the camera!
They do this by taking several pictures with the arm at different angle yet still maintaining the same camera position.
Do they have in program to build some sort of highway on mars for all those rovers out there?
Some gas stations would make profit too!
BigDog too?

A Martian is a native inhabitant of the planet Mars .
Although the search for evidence of life on Mars continues, many science fiction writers have imagined what extraterrestrial life on Mars might be like.
Some writers also use the word Martian to describe a human colonist on Mars .
The word  Martian,  used as a noun instead of an adjective, first entered the English language in late 1877.
It appeared nearly simultaneously in England and the United States, in magazine articles detailing Asaph Hall s discovery of the moons of mars in August of that year.
1] An early, brief fictional account of an invasion of Earth by Martians appeared in 1881, in a futuristic article inspired by the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris .
Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds  1883  by W.
S.
Lach-Szyrma was previously reputed to be the first published work to apply the word Martian as a noun instead of an adjective.
The usage is incidental; it occurs when Aleriel, the novel s protagonist, lands on Mars in a spacecraft called an  ether-car   an allusion to aether , which was once postulated as a gaseous medium in outer space  .
15 years later, H.
G.
Wells   landmark novel The War of the Worlds  1898  was published by William Heinemann, Ltd.
In this story, the Martians are a technologically-advanced race of cephalopod -like extraterrestrials who invade Earth because Mars is becoming too cold to sustain them.
The Martians  undoing is a lethal vulnerability to Earth bacteria.
In his book Mars and Its Canals  1906 , astronomer and businessman Percival Lowell conjectured that an extinct Martian race had once constructed a vast network of aqueducts to channel water to their settlements from Mars  polar ice caps , Planum Australe and Planum Boreum .
Lowell did not invent this Martian canal hypothesis, but he supported it.
4] The belief that Mars had canals was based on observations Giovanni Schiaparelli made through his reflecting telescope .
Although the telescope s image was fuzzy, Schiaparelli thought he saw long, straight lines on the Martian surface; some astronomers came to believe that these lines were structures built by Martians.
This idea inspired Lowell, who returned to the subject in Mars As the Abode of Life  1910 , wherein he wrote a fanciful description of what this Martian society may have been like.
5] Although his description was based on almost no evidence, Lowell s words evoked vivid pictures in his readers  imaginations.
One of the people Lowell inspired was Edgar Rice Burroughs , who began writing his own story about Mars in the summer of 1911.
The story is a planetary romance in which an American Civil War veteran named John Carter is transported to Mars when he walks inside a cave on Earth.
He finds that Mars is populated by two species of warring humanoids , and he becomes embroiled in their conflict.
In February 1912, an American pulp magazine called The All-Story published Burroughs  story as the first installment of a serial novel , which the editor titled Under the Moons of Mars  retitled A Princess of Mars in subsequent editions .
The book was the first in Burroughs  Barsoom series.
Although the noun Martian can describe any organism from Mars, these and later works typically imagine Martians as a humanoid monoculture.
Martian, in this sense, is more like the word human than the word Earthling .
In science fiction, Martians are stereotypically imagined in one or more of the following ways: As alien invaders ; as humanoids with a civilization that resembles one on Earth; as anthropomorphic animals; as beings with superhuman abilities; as humanoids with a lower intelligence than humans; as human colonists who adopt a Martian identity; and or as an extinct race who possessed high intelligence.
H.
G.
Wells  novel The War of the Worlds  1898  and its various adaptations have been an extraordinary influence on science fiction writers for more than 100 years.
Wells  Martians are a technologically advanced species with an ancient civilization.
They somewhat resemble cephalopods with large, bulkish brown bodies and sixteen snake-like tentacles, in two groups of eight, around a quivering v-shaped mouth; they move around in 100 foot tall tripod fighting-machines they assemble upon landing, killing everything in their path.
They invade Earth because Mars is dying, and they need a warmer planet to live on.
They attack cities in southern England , including London , with a deadly heat-ray they fire from a camera-like device on an articulated arm attached to their tripods; they also employ chemical warfare, using a poisonous  black smoke  launched from gun-like tubes.
Mankind is saved by Earth bacteria, which kills the Martians within three weeks of their landing on Earth.
In Last and First Men  1930  Olaf Stapledon visited Wells  theme of Martian invasion.
Last and First Men summarizes tens of thousands of years of invasions and war between Martians and humans.
Eventually, humans destroy the Martians  empire.
Warner Bros.
Marvin the Martian , a short, slender figure with comically oversized eyes, hands, and feet, but no visible mouth.
His big, spherical head is either completely black or always under the shadow of his Roman-like helmet.
His clothing is patterned on that of Mars , the god of war in Roman mythology .
In Marvin s film debut, Haredevil Hare  1948 , he attempts to blow up Earth because it  obscures  view of Venus  .
In the Superman story  Black Magic on Mars   1950 ,  Superman faces Martians led by a dictator called Martler, who is an admirer of Adolf Hitler .
In William Cameron Menzies Invaders from Mars  1953 , remade by Tobe Hooper in 1986, fuses the tentacles of Wells  Martians to the idea little green men in the form of a Martian Mastermind; it uses tall, green mutant humanoid servant-slaves to do its bidding.
In his 1955 comic novel , Martians, Go Home , Fredric Brown spoofs the Wellsian invasion, and reinterprets the Martian invader as a rude house guest with ulterior motives.
Brown, too, employs the  little green men  trope to describe his annoying Martians.
In Mars Attacks!
1996 , a science fiction black comedy , based on a Topps trading cards series, written by Jonathan Gems and directed by Tim Burton , the Martian invaders are loud, irritating, and dim-witted, despite having over-sized heads with extremely large, protruding brains.
They invade a town in the Midwestern United States during a re-broadcast of the Orson Wells  1938 radio dramatization of The War of the Worlds .
In   Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?  , a 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone , Martians attempt to colonize Earth, but are thwarted by Venusians .
Here, the Martians are disguised as humans, but towards the end of the episode we see they have three arms.
In Mars Needs Moms  2007 , a picture book by Berkeley Breathed , Martians are squat, humanoid beings with antennae and skin color that varies by individual.
When they travel to Earth, they wear transparent helmets and a bulbous, ribbed outer garment.
In the story a five-year-old boy learns to appreciate his mother after three Martians kidnap her while he sleeps.
Writer-director Simon Wells and his wife Wendy adapted the picture book into the film Mars Needs Moms  2011 .
Little green men recur in the 2009 video game Stalin vs.
Martians , a spoof of earlier strategy video games .
As the president of the Soviet Union , the player defends Earth from Martian invasion.
This time the caricature of the Martians appears to be influenced by H.
R.
Giger .
In April 1911, about a year before The All-Story published the first installment of Burroughs  Under the Moons of Mars, Modern Electrics began publishing Hugo Gernsback  s own romance, Ralph 124C 41+ , which takes place on Earth.
Gernsback s Martians live among the humans on Earth; they are taller and physically stronger than humans, with green skin and large eyes.
The serial wasn t republished as a book until 1925.
1923 saw the publication of Aelita, or The Decline of Mars , a novel that is equally science fiction and political fiction .
Its author, Soviet Russian writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy , tells a story of a Soviet engineer who builds a rocket and invites an acquaintance to accompany him in it to Mars.
There they find a humanoid race of Martians who are the offspring of both an elder Martian species and of humans from Atlantis .
The Martians live in a class society ; the workers rise up against the ruling class , but the revolution fails.
All the while, Mars is entering a phase of climate change that threatens disaster for the population.
Red Planet  1932 , a play cowritten by John L.
Balderston and John Hoare, also deals with radical environmental change on Mars, except in this case it occurs through terraforming .
Balderston was one of the few playwrights of the 20th century to adopt Mars or Martians as a subject for the stage.
He was, however, also a screenwriter who specialized in fantasy film and horror film .
Many years later, United Artists bought a screen adaptation that Balderston and fellow screenwriter Anthony Veiller wrote.
Harry Horner directed the film, called Red Planet Mars , and it was released to cinemas in 1952.
In the film, a scientist communicates with Martians by radio, and they tell him that Mars is a utopia.
When the news circulates, it causes widespread unrest among the people of Western nations.
The US government tries to silence further messages, then later announces that the Martians have informed them that they must all worship God in order to save themselves.
After millions of people revolt against their governments, it seems the Martian communiques may have been a hoax.
In four stories by Eric Frank Russell published in the early 1940s and collected in the classic Men, Martians and Machines  1955 , a crew of humans and humanoid Martians are shipmates and compatriots on an interstellar voyage.
During their travels, they encounter hostile aliens.
Ray Bradbury  s novel The Martian Chronicles  1950  depicts Martians as a refined and artistic race of golden-skinned beings who closely resemble humans.
The Martians are almost completely wiped out by the diseases brought to Mars by human invaders.
At the end of the book, the human inhabitants of Mars realize that they are the new Martians.
The novel s themes and its portrayal of Martians resemble Bradbury s 1949 short story   Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed  .
Brothers Jim Thomas and John Thomas teamed with Graham Yost to write Mission to Mars  2000 , a film that depicts Martians as tall, feminine, peaceful humanoids who left Mars to escape the havoc caused by a massive meteorite impact.
C.
S.
Lewis wrote, in Out of the Silent Planet  1938 , about three humans who visit Mars and meet three different kinds of intelligent native creatures: The hrossa, the sorns séroni, and the pfifltriggi.
They are dying out, but are resigned to their fate.
The books also describe a prey animal called hnakra, which is hunted.
The planet is ruled by the Oyarsa, who are also called  eldil .
As a writer for Doctor Who , Brian Hayles created a Martian species of reptilian humanoids called Ice Warriors , who move stiffly and speak in a husky whisper.
Most of the Ice Warriors that the Doctor encounters are brutish and belligerent.
As Mars  climate becomes less favorable to sustaining them, the Ice Warriors seek a new planet.
These reptilians debuted in The Ice Warriors  1967 , a Doctor Who television serial about an impending ice age in Earth s future.
As British scientists try to slow or avert a glacier encroaching on Great Britain, they find an Ice Warrior near their base, frozen in the glacier, and apparently in suspended animation .
No one knows the being s identity, but they understand that it is probably from another planet.
When the Ice Warrior revives, he attacks the first person he sees and kidnaps a young woman.
Many of Robert A.
Heinlein  s Martian characters are humans born and raised on Mars.
In Red Planet  1949 , boys attend a boarding school in a human colony on Mars.
A population of native Martians tolerates them until the colony administrator threatens a Martian child.
The Martians demand that the humans leave Mars, but a human doctor convinces them to let reconsider.
In Heinlein s 1956 novel Double Star , humans have colonized the solar system, and a politician on Mars faces the civil rights issue of granting a native Martian species  who are second-class citizens   the right to vote .
In Philip K.
Dick  s novel Martian Time-Slip  1964 , a human colony on Mars is trying to cope with arduous environmental conditions.
They treat an aboriginal race, whom they call  Bleekmen , with casual racism.
In The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch  1965 , Mars has no indigenous life.
Dick previously published a shorter version of the story in 1963, called All We Marsmen.
Like Heinlein s Double Star, All We Marsmen was conceived at a time in US history when many marginalized people were fighting especially vehemently for more civil rights.
US President Lyndon B.
Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on 2 July 1964.
Total Recall  1990  is a science fiction action film about an apparently unsophisticated construction worker who turns out to be a freedom fighter from Mars who has been relocated to Earth.
He later learns of an alien artifact that proves Mars harbored life before the human colonization.
The character designers for Futurama , a comical American animated series , imagine Mars after human colonization as being like the American frontier ; native Martians inhabit zones analogous to Indian reservations .
One of the series principal characters, Amy Wong , is a scientist of Chinese descent who was born on Mars.
Her parents have amassed an enormous fortune and enterprise there.
Rebecca Bloomer s novel Unearthed  2011 , the first in a series, describes a futuristic human colony on Mars amidst the populations of native Martians.
A photograph of Mars captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on 26 June 2001.
For his Known Space series of novels, Larry Niven conceived humanoid Martians with a primitive material culture who inhabit an environment of red dust and nitric acid , and for whom water is lethal.
In the 1973 novel Protector , a man named Jack Brennan allies himself with a ruthless, xenophobic humanoid species called the Pak .
To preclude the possibility future competition for Pak offspring, Brennan engineers a Martian genocide by sending an ice-covered asteroid to collide with Mars.
In Dennis Feltham Jones   1977 novel Colossus and the Crab , Martian life predated life on Earth, but faced a process of devolution as conditions on the planet worsened.
Quatermass and the Pit  1958–59  is a British television serial in which a crashed spacecraft is discovered in London.
The wreck evidences that the human population of Earth resulted from the experiments of a Martian civilisation, now long dead.
A film remake was released in 1967.
Ghosts of Mars  2001  human invaders war with Martians in an attempt to conquer Mars.
In the Invader Zim episode  Battle of the Planets   2001 , Zim discovers that a Martian race died off after converting Mars into a giant spacecraft.
In Doom 3  2004 , the entire Martian race sacrificed itself many millennia ago in order to prevent a demonic invasion of our universe.
By the year 2145, humanity has colonized Mars and begun excavating the ruins of their civilization, recovering several important artifacts.
One of these artifacts - known as the Soul Cube - is the player s most valuable tool in combating a second demonic invasion, as it is the only weapon capable of killing the Cyberdemon .
In Robert Heinlein s Stranger in a Strange Land  1961 , a man raised by native Martians emigrates to Earth, where he must reacclimate.
In the novel he functions as a Christ figure .
Soon he demonstrates psychic powers, superhuman intelligence, and an ability to manipulate higher dimensions.
He founds a church on Earth based on Martian philosophy, and starts a cultural shift.
At the novel s climax, he is murdered by a mob from a rival religious group.
In 1963, American television network CBS premiered a sitcom called My Favorite Martian .
The series proved popular in the US, especially during the first season, and CBS broadcast more than one hundred episodes before canceling it when the third season ended in 1966.
In this comedy, a Martian anthropologist  who passes for human in most respects  crashes on Earth, where he is harbored by an American man who keeps the Martian s identity secret.
Also secret are the Martian s extraordinary abilities, not the least of which are invisibility and telepathy .
CBS s rival networks, NBC and ABC , did not fail to notice the success of My Favorite Martian, or the comic potential of a character with secret powers.
In 1964, ABC introduced Bewitched  a sitcom about a married, suburban witch , and NBC countered the following year with I Dream of Jeannie , a sitcom about an astronaut who discovers and marries a genie.
In Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons  1967–68 , the Mysterons are a race of invisible superbeings from Mars who are at war with humans from Earth.
The conflict begins when Captain Black , a human officer investigating radio signals from Mars, mistakes a surveillance camera for a weapon.
In violation of his orders, he attacks, but the Mysterons immediately repair the damage he caused.
The conflict escalates, and the Mysterons attempt to assassinate the president of Earth.
DC Comics introduced the first Martian superhero to the DC Universe in 1955.
Martian Manhunter  J onn J onzz , a green humanoid who is believed to be the last of the peaceful Green Martians, joins the Justice League .
Meanwhile, the warlike, shapeshifting White Martians regard the Green Martians as enemies.
The White Martians adopt a humanoid form which, they say, expresses their distinctive philosophy.
DC introduced a White Martian superhero, Miss Martian , in 2006.
A third race, the Yellow Martians , may or may not have survived as long as the Green and White Martians.

Suspicion or interest in life on the Moon grabbed public attention     when the inventor of the radio  so credited  Marconi, Tesla publicly     reported his experiments in transmitting radio signals to the Moon     and attempting to receive answers, which he indeed believed took     place.
After that, American, British, and French astronomers     reported glowing and moving and sometimes even blinking lights on     the Moon during the 1920s and 1930s, often reported in local     newspapers and scientific journals of those years which can often be     found in major libraries.
This interest peaked when a respected     expert in aerial phenomenon, Pulitzer Prize winning astronomer John     O’Neill, publicly reported observing the “bridge” on the Moon that     appeared artificially constructed by intelligence.
The bridge sighting     occurred in the early 1950s.

Earth and we have seen these also.
One     Soviet astronaut mission in the 1960s, designed to set a new record     for time in orbit, was mysteriously aborted right after their craft     entered space.
Soviet craft.
The     cosmonauts reportedly panicked and were immediately sent back to     Earth.
S seen over Earth were tracked back to     the Moon by government tracking stations in secret complexes in     deserts in Arizona and Nevada and inside underground mountain bases.
WE HAVE ONE PHOTO OF A SAUCER SHAPED CRAFT HOVERING OVER THE MOON,     taken by a civilian astronomer.
O.
Ohio when in Army Intelligence,     showed us an 8 by 10 CLEAR glossy detailed photo of a silvery     spaceship hovering directly over a huge Moon landscape, estimated to     be several miles long, and said to be CITY-SHIP designed to     transport thousands of people between solar systems or galaxies and     live for extended periods of time in self-sufficient orbiting     communities!
In the 1950s to 1960s more moving, flashing, and stationary lights     were seen on the Moon by civilian astronomers, usually inside     craters, along with a mysterious glowing cross.
A.
A.
WITHOUT COMMENT!
Many of     the structures can only be seen when these photos are blown-up to a     much larger size.
THE DARK SIDE is always hidden to our     eyes and telescopes on Earth, an obviously perfect place for aliens     to construct secret hidden spaceports.
A admits our scientists have the technology  but not the     billions of dollars  to construct, an underground bases with     artificial air-conditioning like our military now has on Earth.

Moon.
In 1978 a mysterious tall, stocky, agent-appearing stereotype man     moved to Maui, identified as a Mr.
English.
I cannot give out his     full name.
Apollo     astronauts, had photographed the wreckages and bodies of crashed     alien flying discs in a secret Texas Air Force hanger, and had a     seen an unidentified spacecraft in flight while with astronauts.
O.
Moon, and that our Moon expose’ is true!
Soviet radio operators also picked it up     and published it in Moscow.
Another mysterious radio message from the     Moon was broadcast on French public television only one time before     it was censored AFTER it leaked out.
That transmission appeared to     be a mysterious clearly spoken ALIEN LANGUAGE.
S.
A, and expert linguists have been unable     to translate the message.
The dome-ical structures are      partially filled up.
Breach has either flowed into these      STRUCTURES before they were BUILT or the DOMES are younger than      the floor.
What are these domes and structures that     were built?
When news reporters asked space program     officials what these terms were all about, they were absurdly told     that these are metaphors for geological formations.
However, the     scientist “who taught geology to the astronauts”, admitted he was     totally baffled by those terms!
When news reporters asked him about the flashes of     light, Mr.
Bez replied, “there is no question about it.
How could the most organized structure     Irwin had ever seen be a natural formation?
How can geological     formations flash on and off.
A.
Domes up to     1,500 feet high, taller than our skyscrapers were too high to deny     that they were bigger than any building on Earth  miles wide .
A     radio tower appearing thing was photographed, along with sequences     of large moving vehicles leaving tracks in the lunar soil.
We have     these photo reproductions.
The Apollo program only cost less than     one percent of the budget!
Considering the huge billions spent on     DEFENSE, the military advantage of having a base on the Moon would     be enormous.
Why were the American space officials of the 1950s-60s     so publicly afraid that the Soviet military might beat America to     the Moon to gain a military advantage.
So why risk that serious     threat by abandoning the Moon flights?
And why did the Soviet     cosmonauts NEVER land on the Moon?
COULD IT BE THAT THE MOON IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND SOMEONE ELSE S     PROPERTY, AND THE MOON GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT US COMING UP AND     INVADING THEIR TERRITORY WITH OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, POLLUTION,     UNWELCOME MILITARY FACILITIES, DISEASES, LITTER, MINING     EXPLOITATION, AND HISTORICALLY PROVEN RECORD OF FOREIGN IMPERIALISM?
S.
Hawaiians, and other cultures.
And     would Moon citizens welcome Soviet Communist dictatorship, military     aggression, and slave labor circa 1960s-70s?
We doubt it.
A.
Was it the Apollo orbit around the Moon that sent     back photographs of mining operations, domes, roads, a pyramid, a     spaceport  named Luna  and lakes on the hidden dark side of the     Moon?
Did they fear a possible alien invasion from that base and     panic and fear the public would panic?
No official wants to admit what corrupt negative folks they are on     the six o-clock news, after being told so by aliens!
The Lamont Observatory and other civilian experts     noted that fact.

We have accumulated massive research indicating our Moon was     colonized and explored by races from other planets, most notably in     the Orion constellation, and that aliens called ZETANS from Zeta Reticuli are active there today.
Earth     nations.
A.
Secretary of Defense already HAVE     panicked.
If they can do that will all their military power, where     do we stand?
A chance?
Some of these star wars were fought on     Earth in ancient times when colonies from different planets fought     for our planet to try to take control.
The Pleideans from planet Erra, humans from a spaceport on Venus, Sethians, Centaurians and     beings from the reported 12th planet in our system were involved in     these battles on Earth and were mostly driven off the planet  except     for remaining secret underground cities and bases all of those     civilizations still have on Earth .
The Zetans now have a spaceport     on the hidden dark side of the Moon, and many underground cities     there too.
They also have scientific, military, and mining stations     on the surface of the Moon.
Earth .
Earth atmosphere is poisonous to Zetans.
Zetans would like on     Earth for themselves.
So they live in underground cities in the United     States, Soviet Union, Moon, Mars and certain asteroids off Jupiter.
A.
SPACE PROGRAM is a public     front and proof it is a public “disinformation agency”, and we have     files of false contradictory statements it has made about the     atmospheres of Venus, Mars, the Moon, etc.
It is known to some as Alternative 3 .
Alternative 3 was to develop a top     secret insiders space program with Majority  MJ-12  as a secret     interplanetary state department in the Pentagon, and secretly build     underground spaceports to live in on Mars and the Moon and surface     domed manufacturing, mining, communications, and other centers.
The     ALTERNATIVE 3 astronauts landed on the Moon and built their own     bases many years BEFORE the FIRST APOLLO ASTRONAUTS landed on the     Moon in 1969, as the result of a secret treaty between the Pentagon and the Zetans.
The Zetans helped the Department of Majority     colonize the Moon with secret bases, and in exchange the Pentagon’s     Majority Department helped the ZETANS colonize the United States with their own secret underground bases.
The Pentagon decided that     co-operating with the ZETANS was a better idea than being invaded!
A.
Zetans and thus at a military     disadvantage.
Of course, our Presidents did not want to go on the     six o’clock news to talk about how they made a top secret treaty     with a violent conquering foreign planet that in the past nuked the     Earth people!
Not a bad reason for a big secret.
A.
S live there!
They have never shown the     public most of the 2,000 photos they promised us with VIKING I.
When     the first Apollo astronauts landed on our Moon in 1969, they were     shocked to find it already inhabited.
Thousands of Americans,     Soviets, British, French, and Australians were ALREADY LIVING THERE!
Astronauts who discovered too much truth and were considered     security risks died in those famous accidents in the shuttle or on     the launch pad, etc.
The footage of the American spacecraft     landing on Mars BEFORE Apollo landed on the Moon leaked out in major     public British TV for one evening, thanks to a smuggling scientist,     before it was Censored and never made it to America.
British     authorities tried to call it a hoax to cover-up the leak, but it was     no hoax.
The only astronaut who has ever died outside of duty said     it was the truth on video, and he was silenced.
We have seen that     interview too, as well as a secret video stewing the scientist who     leaked that video being assassinated.
A book exposing ALTERNATIVE 3 appeared in 1976 and was quickly forced out of print.
I have read     it.
You can’t even order it, and the printers will not issue a new     release in spite of a huge demand!
Very strange to turn down that     big profit.
Not really.
Le Meilleur, was another leaked that was     covered up fast.
Spoken of the     mysterious message heard on the Moon---20 untranslatable words?
Seeds of panic.
Everything was going well that day on our Moon, then at 11:15 an     extraordinary fading occurred and contact with Houston was lost.
Worden, who was in charge of telecommunications, had his attention     drawn by a breathing sound and a long whistle.
A sentence was     constantly repeated on one note, varying from a small to a shrill     tone, and from lightly stressed sounds to raucous exclamations.
A.
Perhaps we need some OUTSIDE     universal threat to make us recognize this common bond.

We are from what you     know as the planet Mars.
We can only come to Earth every two years,”     and left a warning that Earth people should stay out of space.
They     said that they were studying the organic materials on Earth because     of the rocky structure of Mars, and that they did not fly near our     cities because they avoided the air pollution.
The beings told     Wilcox everything in monotone.
He asked if he could go with them and     they rejected.
Wilcox gave the beings a bag of fertilizer and exchanged information     about it and other subjects, before they entered the craft and took     off.
Wilcox was investigated by a psychiatrist and the sheriff     department, who found him a normal, truthful person with no     emotional problems, and they confessed they believed his UFO     experience was real.

The most famous astronomers of the early twentieth century,     including the great Percival Lovell, stated there were signs of     intelligent life on Mars.
They reported huge areas of green     vegetation that expanded and contracted with the melting of the ice     caps and the 4 seasons on Mars.
In the 1950s, teachers in public     schools in America taught students that the temperature at the     Martian equator was about 80 degrees.
The man credited with inventing the radio, Marconi, published data     that he believed he had received intelligent radio signals from     Mars.
A series of dots and dashes, in Morse     code was revealed on a machine, reportedly originating from the     direction of Mars, and drawing a human face on a piece of receiving     paper in dots and dashes!

In 1976 the famous Viking probe was sent to Mars by NASA, and out of over 2,000 photos     reportedly taken of that planet, only a small fraction were shown to     the public.
Since most of those photos were not released to the     news-media, were they trying to hide something?
S.
Mars.
We have studied other     Mars photos showing what appears to be an ancient ruined city,     roads, rectangular buildings, and walls.
Skeptics say that shadows     may make natural objects appear like a man-made structure, yet all     the photos taken from different angles of the sun and the cameras     show the exact same objects the same way, ruling out the shadow     theory.
The proof that the NASA space program covers up the truth about Mars is all tile serious contradictions in their public data.
NASA told     the public that the Martian atmosphere is less than one percent of     that of Earth.
Then how could their 50 foot parachute on the rocket     they landed on Mars even slow it down?
Scientists calculated NASA     would need a parachute over a mile wide to slow down the Viking     probe in a one percent atmosphere!
Their 50 foot parachute would     crash like a rock!
Furthermore, if the Martian atmosphere     is only one percent of Earth’s, how can sand dunes similar to our     deserts in Arizona be photographed.
Impossible!
It would take 200     mile-per-hour winds on a planet with air said to be so thin that no     winds over 40 miles-per-hour had ever been recorded, and the warm     rising air to cause those winds did not even exist on that part of     Mars  according to other NASA data .
NASA also claimed that the     temperatures around the Martian polar areas was a minus 90 to 120     degrees, in a region where another NASA statement said the polar ice     melts.
How can ice melt at minus 90 to 120 degrees below zero?
It     melts at 32 degrees above zero.
What life on Earth could survive in soil     blasted at thousands of degrees by poisonous chemicals ?
All the     loose topsoil of any potential biological value was blown away by     the rocket landing.
We are also told that the Martian     temperature ranged from minus 22 below zero  F  to minus 122 degrees.
One Viking probe landed about a thousand miles closer to their     equator than the other one, yet contradicted logic by reporting the     temperature at the equatorial region was colder than up north.
100 percent mistake during atmospheric measurements.
The argon      content of the Martian atmosphere was not 30 percent, but only 3      percent.
Dr.
IT IS OBVIOUSLY WETTER THAN WE      ANTICIPATED.
THERE IS GROUND FOG AT THE LANDING SITE DURING PART      OF THE DAY.
NASA data, to a meteorologist,     problematically proves Mars is much warmer than official reports     stated.
Ground fog is made by warm moist air moving across cool land     or water, and ground fog is a product of temperatures ABOVE 32     degrees Fahrenheit.
7 millibars.
Evidence indicates that 32 degrees above zero must exist up to at     least 15,000 feet on Mars, which is higher than Haleakala Crater in     Hawaii.
We all know we can live as we walk through Haleakala.
Minus     122 degree temperatures can exist in certain parts of Mars, just     like minus127 degrees has been recorded on Earth.
There are also thousands of American scientists, engineers, medical     personal, and other specialists secretly living in Martian     underground bases and cities, who have either been abducted by UFOs     and taken there, or are part of a top secret exchange program with     the Pentagon’s MJ-12 agency called ALTERNATIVE THREE .
The Pentagon has been secretly trading livestock, minerals, and a labor force to     these Zetans on Mars, for a couple of decades at least, for     technology that was developed into the Star Wars defense system,     lasers, superior metals, computers, medical advancements, etc.
Martians also live on Earth underground at secret cities and bases,     like the one below the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean     established by Baavians.
Most Martians are 3 to 4 feet tall, yet not all of them are the same     size or race.
The underground civilization has no pollution, disease, crime,     poverty, political corruption, malnutrition, or warfare, and few of     the problems associated with Earth civilization.
It has been described as a technological, intellectual, scientific,     computerized paradise, where emotions such as pleasure, sexual     ecstasy, and individuality have been eliminated among the locals.
Following leaders called Knowers is the norm.
Cloning is the main     form of reproduction.
However, there is also a spiritual civilization on Mars that is so     far advanced that the other civilizations cannot interfere with it.
The spiritual civilization has very little involvement with Earth     and avoids its internal affairs.
This civilization is on a higher     4th dimensional frequency than the other 3D nations on Mars.
The sand dunes on Mars photographed by     the Orbiter have the SAME height and dune to dune spacing as sand     dunes on Earth in Colorado.
That is impossible in an atmosphere one     percent of Earth’s.
Viking 2 revealed the Martian polar caps are     frozen water, that snows often, and the atmosphere above the polar     areas is saturated with water vapor.
NASA stated the North Pole on     Mars is now going through its summer, so the ice cap is about as     small as it ever gets.
How can ice in these below zero temperatures     melt like they said it does?
Dr.
Martin, who was with Pasadena Viking Control, said the biology     instrument on Mars have received positive signs of life in spite of     the amazing fact it was at such a blow-torched landing site!

Scientists     admit that if all the water trapped below the surface of Mars was     released to the surface, it would form an ocean a mile deep covering the entire planet!

An international AP release stated that photos of Mars’ northern     regions reveal mysterious patterns, resembling contour PLOWING on     the planet’s red surface.
Striped patterns that resemble an aerial     photograph of a farmers field after plowing have been studied with     no natural explanation.
The stripes are too regular to be natural.
Mars was     colonized by extraterrestrials from the Proxima Centauri solar     system about 15,000 years ago.
As a result, when the night temperature     on the red Martian plains dips to sixty to one hundred degrees below     zero, near the moss at the canyon floors it may be 40 to 50 degrees     above zero.
The oxygen of the air is largely fixed by the ground     under the atmospheric pressure that is really about a tenth of the     surface of Earth  at sea level , so there can be a 40 degree     difference between air and ground.
The bottoms of such canyons have     released enough oxygen to support a small humanoid monad Martian     with robust vitality.
Even NASA admits huge quantities of oxygen     and water are trapped below the Martian ground .
The report added that the mammals on Mars are rodents with thick     white fur, comparable to large hares, that feed on roots, larvae,     and the eggs of big lizards that live among the low rocks of the     canyon walls.
In deep hollows, water forms marshes in which     crustaceans proliferate.
About 12,000 years ago life-sustaining     conditions on Mars deteriorated to the point where it became urgent     to evacuate most of the inhabitants, who migrated to Earth and     landed high in the mountains of Tibet, where the air is thin with     little oxygen like it is on Mars.
However, before the exodus the Baavians had hybrid genetic     cross-breeding with the short native Martians with the somewhat     Oriental features.
This inter-racial mixing took place over many generations over 3,000     years, producing a humanoid hybrid.
However, many of the residents     of Mars flew to the Moon and Earth  where many primitive ancients     mistook them for gods .
Mars once had large oceans, abundant atmosphere, and vegetation     according to official NASA research.
They just try to cover it up     today.
We have much detail on the Baavian civilization on their home     planet, in our other publications.
The Martians who landed on Earth     about 11 to 12 thousand years ago, over hundreds of generations,     slowly adopted to lower elevations and Earth’s climate as they     gradually migrated to the lowlands over the centuries to seed the     Asian races.
There are also different races living on     Mars.
These races originate from other solar systems, and are not at     the same level of spiritual, technical, or intellectual evolution,     disagreeing on interplanetary affairs.
One race active on Mars is     reportedly from Zeta Reticuli, a small humanoid grey race with large     heads, long slender arms, and no lungs  they do not need an     atmosphere to breath , and no digestive system as we know the Zetans are biologically somewhat like insects, with thick tough skin     adaptable withstanding a harsher atmosphere like on the surface of Mars.
There are also androids and robots living on the Martian     surface!
The Sirian Interplanetary Empire reportedly claimed Mars before it     claimed Earth in Atlantean times, and the ancients called the Sirian     constellation the Phoenix Constellation.
The Phoenician Empire in ancient Persia worshipped Sirius, and the     Phoenix Project of the Secret Government  Illuminati  using     technology Tesla, Einstein, Parsons, and Von Neumann, was named after     the Sirian solar system and constellation.
Its former directors now     trying to expose its secrets claimed that the Sirians gave them     their technology of mind-control, time-travel, invisibility, etc.
Lemuria , Atlantis , and other ancient Earth     empires as these races fought for control of the Earth’s natural     resources, people, and rulers.
The Sirians evacuated Mars when its atmosphere and surface was     devastated by nuclear war and a comet, while the Alcyone Pleiadeans evacuated Venus in the same conflicts Venus Whov.
Whatever race     lived on Mercury also had to leave its material plane, yet we have     yet to discover specifically who lived there before it was hocked     out of orbit and spun closer to the sun in a nuclear cataclysm.
Of     course, Maldek was blown apart into asteroids in these cataclysms.
This scenario is allegedly the reason why the Galactic     Confederation, the Solar Police Force, the Ashtar      Command , and even     the Orion League  Star Wars Evil Empire  will not allow a major     nuclear war on Earth anymore.
Such a cataclysm would destroy the     Orion colony on the Moon  Luna  and the Sirian colony today on Mars.
The Illuminati and its 4th Reich  New Berlin Nazis , Asian     Communism, and Western nuclear powers do not want such a war for the     same reasons.
It took too long to recover last times.
The Clementine     probe that took over a million detailed photos of the Moon in the     1990s took a lot of detailed photos of domes and ruins and artifacts     on the Lunar surface that are not available to the public.
I have     been in close association with Richard Hoagland and his Mars     Mission.
Hoagland is the famous scientists who wrote the Monuments of Mars and publicly exposed the Face, pyramids, and other Martian and Lunar     ruins on CNN, major newspapers, and national and international     magazines.
He came to Maui in 1994 when I was only able to say Hi     and shake hands.
Later I became affiliated with his Mars Mission to     expose this huge news.
We witnessed color photos of the shattered     domes and other artifacts on the Moon blown up to movie theater     screen size at the Castle Theater on Maui.
They were shocking     evidence of some incredible ancient Lunar cataclysms.
Hoagland also sent details of suppressed photos taken by Clementine that further confirm this evidence and a lot more.
It also turned     out that NASA had been releasing several-generation copies of the     key photos instead of the clearest archive originals, and in the     archives same key photos were missing completely!
Hoagland had     demanded access to the NASA archives and was given a lot of     run-around until certain NASA researchers sided with him and showed     him some hidden evidence.
Arnold’s classic movie Total Recall.
This is a mostly     TRUE MOVIE about secret Pentagon  Soviet  Illuminati activities on     Mars.
A lot of truth is leaking out as so-called fragmented fiction.
Some researchers now think the 39,000 year old Egyptian Sphinx was a Sirian Martian GODDESS whose breasts were sheered off by invading     Christians who condemned goddess worship and defaced the hair and     face destroying its feminine features.
This information comes from the Phoenix Project scientists and technicians.
Aleister Crowley and his Magic secret societies are allegedly the     legacy of Martian Secret Science and Sirian psychic and inter     dimensional genetics.
When you first see Alien Disclosure UK s  evidence  of life on the Red Planet, all you can see is a mass of rocks.
But as the camera zooms in and then pulls back, you cannot help but make out the form of a little green man scuttling forward to pick up what appears to be an iconic Dr Martens boot lying on the dusty floor.
The video is the latest in a long line of curious and quirky images from the Red Planet that internet users have jumped to interpret.
That s where we left it!
However, it is unlikely to be the smoking gun  or boot  that NASA has been looking for to announce the existence of extra-terrestrial existence.
In the early days, the planet was throwing up curiosities.
In the 1800s, earthbound observers were certain they could see canals - and even cities - through their telescopes.
But as we became better with our optics, so did our understanding of Mars, and this belief was put to bed as newer images showed no trace of life.
Then, in 1976, Mars was back with a new mystery - the famous Face on Mars, taken by the Viking 1 during a flyby in 1976.
This was later shown to be just another light and perspective trick by Mars, but the haunting visage captured the world s attention.
More recently, YouTube user StephenHannardADGUK, part of Alien Disclosure UK, has been gazing at the latest images from the Curiosity Rover, and has collected a fine collection of oddities.
These include white  flying objects  zooming across the Martian sky - and then a  collection of mysterious  items  he spotted in a video from Gale Crater.
The  image shows what appears to be a rock shaped like a digit with a faint  outline at one end that vaguely resembles a fingernail.
Another  rock found nearby resembles an overturned sandal, and a crevice on  another geological formation looks like a smiling Martian critter.
He announced:  Mars Curiosity captures a  possible ancient finger, a dome shaped object, a shoe or sandal and a  possible Martian creature.
The YouTube video - posted by a Stephen Hannard - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence.
Two lights are seen on Mars.

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the last of  the four Inner Planets .
Mercury , Venus and Earth are the other Inner Planets .
It  is the second closest planet to Earth and is about half as wide.
In mythology,  Mars is the Roman god of War, a name possibly inspired by the planet s red   blood  colour.
Because of its colour, Mars is sometimes known as the Red  Planet.
The length of a day on Mars is not much longer than a  day on Earth .
It takes 24 hours and 37 minutes for Mars to spin once on its  axis, compared to 23 hours and 56 minutes for Earth to do the same.
A Martian  day is often called a Sol.
To complete a full journey around the Sun , Mars takes  687 days.
Therefore, a Martian year is 687 days long.
Mars has two small moons - Phobos and Deimos .
These  moons are very different from the Moon orbiting Earth .
They are  irregularly-shaped, not round like Earth s Moon , and are possibly captured asteroids .
They orbit Mars quite closely and travel around the planet quickly.
Phobos is 9,377 kilometres  5,827 miles  away from Mars and orbits it every 7  hours, 39 minutes.
Deimos is 23,460 kilometres  14,580 miles  away and completes  an orbit in just over 30 hours.
Mars  surface is covered in ancient craters, thought  to have been formed by meteorite impacts over billions of years.
Countless rocks  of all shapes and sizes are scattered across the surface of the planet,   covered in a dusty layer of rust  iron oxide .
This is what gives Mars its red  colour.
The planet was once volcanically active and is home to the largest  volcano in the Solar System - Olympus Mons.
Olympus Mons is 27 kilometres  17  miles  high.
5 miles  high.
Another feature of Mars  surface is Valles  Marineris, a 4,000 kilometres  2485 miles  long canyon which stretches almost a  quarter of the way around the planet.
Scientists believe that water was once abundant on the  surface of Mars and quite possibly plentiful enough to form oceans similar to  those on Earth .
Nowadays, Mars is a dry planet with only small signs of the  present existence of water.
So where did all of the water go?
Nobody knows for  certain, but scientists certainly aim to find out through missions to Mars .
For  almost half a century, a number of space craft have visited Mars.
Some have  simply flown past it to take pictures, others spend years orbiting the planet to  collect data, and some have even landed on its surface to take in its sights and  sounds, probe its soil and poke its rocks.
Even now, there is a rover on Mars travelling very slowly across its surface and making discoveries.
The main reason for visiting Mars, apart from the fact  that it is fairly easy to get to, is that there is a small chance that the  planet could have supported life at some point in its long history.
There s even  a remote possibility that it could support life in some form today.
The presence  of water is a key factor in this which is why scientists get quite excited  whenever they find some there.
So far, all missions to Mars have been unmanned,  and all discoveries have been made by robots.
However, at some point in the  not-too-distant future  hopefully , people will travel to Mars.
Who knows what  they ll find when they get there?
This scanning electron microscope image shows speroidal features embedded in a layer of iddingsite, a mineral formed by action of water, in a meteorite that came from Mars.
A meteorite from Mars has been studied up-close and scientists have detected tiny structures that could be interpreted as having a biological origin.
14 kilogram  30 pound  meteorite called Yamato 000593  Y000593 .
The meteorite sample contains strong evidence that Mars used to be a lot wetter than it is now, but the researchers also report on the discovery of evidence for â€œbiological processesâ€� that occurred on the Red Planet hundreds of millions of years ago.
Although this sounds exciting, there will likely be some skepticism, but the researchers appear to have foreseen the media circus that â€œMars lifeâ€� always inspires and refused to appear overly excited of some pretty fascinating evidence for ancient microbial life.
In 1996, President Clinton made a high profile announcement on national television that evidence for life had been discovered by NASA scientists inside another Martian meteorite called Allan Hills 84001  ALH84001 .
The discovery focused around scanning electron microscope images of the microscopic detail of ALH84001.
The team, led by David McKay of Johnson Space Center, identified â€œbiogenic structuresâ€� inside the meteorite that was theorized to be formed by indigenous life on Mars.
The controversial media storm surrounding that 1996 announcement stirred a backlash that threw McKayâ€™s teamâ€™s findings into doubt.
However, McKayâ€™s team defended the work after ruling out terrestrial contamination and other factors that may have created the nanometer-sized worm-like structures.
McKay also worked on the Y000593 study until his death in February 2013.
This new work focuses around a meteorite that was discovered in the Yamato Glacier, Antarctica, by a Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 2000.
3 billion years ago from a lava flow.
Then, around 12 million years ago, a powerful impact event shattered the region, blasting quantities of Martian crust, containing any hypothetical lifeforms  and evidence thereof , into space.
These chunks of Mars rock then traveled through interplanetary space until one of the samples, Y000593, encountered Earth and fell to the surface as a meteorite, falling on Antarctica some 50,000 years ago.
There are many known samples of Mars crust that have fallen to Earth as meteorites and are considered incredibly valuable scientific specimens that can be used as time capsules into Marsâ€™ geologic past.
These meteorites are natureâ€™s â€˜sample return missions,â€™ no spaceship required.
While robotic missions to Mars continue to shed light on the planetâ€™s history, the only samples from Mars available for study on Earth are Martian meteorites,â€� said lead author Lauren White, of NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a news release.
On Earth, we can utilize multiple analytical techniques to take a more in-depth look into meteorites and shed light on the history of Mars.
These samples offer clues to the past habitability of this planet.
As more Martian meteorites are discovered, continued research focusing on these samples collectively will offer deeper insight into attributes which are indigenous to ancient Mars.
This scanning electron microscope image of a polished thin section of a meteorite from Mars shows tunnels and curved microtunnels.
In their research, the scientists describe features associated with Martian clay deposits â€” micro-tunnels thread throughout the Y000593 sample.
When compared with terrestrial samples, the Martian shapes appear to closely resemble â€œbio-alteration texturesâ€� in basaltic glasses.
This basically means that this Mars meteorite contains microscopic features that resemble mineral formations created by bacteria on Earth.
Another factor is the discovery of nanometer to micrometer-sized spherules sandwiched between the layers of rock in the meteorite.
These spherules are distinct from the minerals inside the rock and are rich in carbon, another sign that they may have been formed through biological interactions inside the rocky material.
Is this proof of Martian bacteria munching through Mars rock?
We cannot exclude the possibility that the carbon-rich regions in both sets of features may be the product of abiotic mechanisms,â€� the scientists write in their paper .
Abioticâ€™ means mechanisms that are not caused by microbial life, such as some chemical reaction in the rockâ€™s geology.
Their caution has been applauded by other astrobiologists.
Open University .
This is no smoking gun,â€� said White.
We can never eliminate the possibility of  terrestrial  contamination in any meteorite.
Since the 1996 ALH84001 controversy, many other researchers have come forward with meteorite studies that appear to show evidence for life on Mars and other interplanetary locations, but most have been published in sketchy journals with little to no peer review process , which serves to blur valuable research being carried out by astrobiologists.
Therefore, skepticism for any Mars life study is often high.
So, until we can detect and analyze DNA of extraterrestrial origin or have the ability to return pristine samples from Mars, work like this will be filed under â€œfascinating but not conclusiveâ€� in the profound hunt for life beyond Earth.

Rhawn Joseph is suing the space agency after it released photos last week showing a rock on Mars in a place where it hadn t been just 12 days before.
Joseph claims NASA is failing to investigate alien life and wants the rover to go back and snap more photos of the mysterious rock.

A self-described scientist has filed a lawsuit alleging NASA is failing to properly investigate alien life.
Rhawn Joseph, who s written several books on extraterrestrial activity, wants the space agency to further analyze a strange rock on Mars, which he believes is proof of Martian activity.
The author claims researchers have not properly analyzed the stone, which somehow appeared in front of the Opportunity rover last week.
The jelly doughnut-shaped rock initially baffled scientists after it mysteriously showed up in images taken less than two weeks apart.
Rhawn Joseph’s website.
Joseph is suing NASA, claiming that the agency failed to properly investigate a rock found by one of its Mars rovers.
It s now believed it was simply knocked out of the ground by the planetary explorer.
But Joseph, a key writer with the online Journal of Cosmology, says the rock is  a living thing  and has now filed a lawsuit in a California court to make NASA examine it more closely.
Terry Renna AP NASA Administrator Charles Bolden  above  has been named in the lawsuit from Rhawn Joseph accusing the agency of not investigating alien life.
Joseph claims the rock was there the whole time, but that it just grew before it became visible.
Rhawn Joseph via Amazon ‘Biological UFOs: Evidence for Extraterrestrial Extremophiles and Life in Space’ is a book written  by Rhawn Joseph.
Joseph now wants Bolden and his rover team to take 100 high resolution close-up in focus photos of the rock from all sides under appropriate lightning conditions with minimum glare.
He also wants to see 24 microscopic, in-focus images of the exterior, lip, walls and interior of the specimen under appropriate lighting conditions.
And, finally, he wants the rover team to make all of the pictures available to him so he can analyze them himself.
NASA has yet to comment on the suit.

LONDON: More than two years into the Curiosity rover s lonely trek across Mars, conspiracy theorists believe they have struck gold: an  alien thigh bone  has been spotted on the surface of the red planet.
For keen alien hunters, the image below — taken by the rover s  MastCam on August 14 — is proof that large animals once roamed Mars, possibly even dinosaurs.
Northern Voices Online, while the popular site UFO Blogger compares the find to previous images of a  fossilized, reptilian spine  and a  human finger .
The regularity of these  finds  is of course testament not to the once-flourishing wildlife of Mars, but to the human brain s remarkable capacity to spot patterns in random noise.
This was a handy trait for our ancestors when identifying a potential predator among the primeval foliage, but in modern times it s more likely to lead only to those little  huh  moments when we spot a face in some inanimate object.
Of course, there is some truth to conspiracy theorists  hopes of life on Mars, with scientists pointing out last year that the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs could have flung rocks carrying organic matter to the red planet some 66 million years ago.
Seen by  Mars rover Curiosity using its MastCam, this Mars rock may look like a femur thigh bone.
Unfortunately, at this point  and for roughly 3 billion years prior  Mars was a barren place with no flowing water.
However, if the micro-organisms from Earth had hitched a ride to somewhere a little more hospitable, like Europa then it could be a different matter altogether.

Is this photo an alien or dinosaur thigh bone on Mars, as some conspiracy theorists have suggested?
Highly unlikely, NASA scientists have concluded.
The photo, taken by the Curiosity rover on August 14 , had conspiracy theorists in a fit online over the past week because they believed it showed a bone-like object lying on the surface of the red planet.
Northern Voices Online claimed , while a popular UFO blog compared the alleged bone to previous images of a  fossilised, reptilian spine  and a  human finger .
Nasa s Curiosity rover exploring Mars in February, 2013.
In an effort to stop the speculation on numerous sites, some of which said it proved there had been life on Mars, NASA finally decided to give its opinion on Friday , a week after it was taken.
Seen by Mars rover Curiosity using its MastCam, this Mars rock may look like a femur thigh bone,  NASA s scientists said.   mission science team members think its shape is likely sculpted by erosion, either wind or water.
If life ever existed on Mars, scientists expect that it would be small simple life forms called microbes.
Mars likely never had enough oxygen in its atmosphere and elsewhere to support more complex organisms.
Astronomical Society of Victoria s Perry Vlahos, who is an astronomer and also a columnist for Fairfax Media , publisher of this article, said the human brain often played tricks on us.
One of the fantastic things about the human brain is that we re wired for pattern recognition,  Mr Vlahos said.  And so  we look for familiar things in whatever it is that we re glancing at.
He added that he would be  extremely surprised  if the object seen in the photo was anything other than what scientists already expected to see on Mars.
Mr Vlahos said.
So far there had been no evidence that life had ever existed on Mars.
If there was evidence of  on Mars it would have been front-page news way before any of this conspiratorial stuff came up,  Mr Vlahos said.  There have been a number of press conferences that have been held by scientists where they reported such discoveries.
For example] there was a meteorite that was found in Antarctica some 10 years ago and we thought that we had found evidence of bacteria in it coming from Mars and later on it was decided that that wasn t the case.
So no, there s been  and if there ever was it would be at the bacterial level.
Although there have been findings that would suggest there was water on Mars , which is now likely to be in ice form, Mr Vlahos said this would not be enough alone to support life on the planet.
Water on Earth works in conjunction with a lot of other things,  he said.  It s not just water on its own.
There s an atmosphere, there s vegetation, there s all sorts of other systems that work together, precipitation etc .
The Curiosity rover has been on Mars for just over two years now, producing many images that have intrigued scientists and conspiracy theorists.
Earlier this year its counterpart, the Opportunity rover, spotted a mysterious rock shaped like a jelly doughnut that appeared to come out of nowhere when comparing two separate images of the same spot.
It was later explained as a piece of a larger rock that had been broken and moved by the Mars rover Opportunity s wheel in early January.
That fake bone was planted by Team Martian to distract us.
There s a whole army of the little green buggers hiding under the ground waiting for their opportunity to strike.
We need to attack them before they attack us!
Yes, launch Operation Martian Attack and appoint a three star General.
Another great distraction to keep the great unwashed occupied.
Too right!
It s one of Team Abbott s ancestors.
Here we h=go again for the umpeenth time.
A photograph taken at some weird angle and we have a face, a thigh bone or next, Tutankhamun s burial mask and off go the tinfoil hat brigade.
Could we PLEASE round these nutters up and put them all on an island somewhere so they can gibber and mutter and carry on without bothering normal people?
Oh, and separate the sexes so their genes can be deleted from the gen pool.
Jason, so I take it you won t be signing up to join the defensive attacking force?
1.
Hate freedom.
2.
Want the Martian dictator Scorcerion to become dictator of Earth.
3.
Probably fancy a bit of Martian tail.
I cant see it, PaddoBeeGee, but I believe you.
He obviously died of thirst, though, rather than drink VB; I know I would.

On Thursday, media outlets across the English-speaking world creamed their collective space-jeans over a possible  alien thigh bone  recently photographed by the Mars rover Curiosity.
Is This an Alien s Thigh Bone?
Yesterday, NASA issued a press release stating the vaguely bone-shaped rock  is likely sculpted by erosion, either wind or water,  noting that Mars  likely never had enough oxygen  to support complex life.
Planetary Society Senior Editor Emily Lakdawalla was even less equivocal in her dismissal.

On Sunday, October 19, 2014, an interplanetary robotic fleet watched as Comet Siding Spring swooped within about 130,000 kilometers of Mars.
On Sunday, October 19, 2014, an interplanetary robotic fleet watched as Comet Siding Spring swooped within about 130,000 kilometers of Mars.
That’s only one third the distance between Earth and the moon, and the closest anyone’s ever observed a comet approach a planet without hitting it.
The Hubble telescope has been checking-in on Siding Spring for more than a year during the comet’s journey toward Mars from the outer solar system.
The Hubble telescope has been checking-in on Siding Spring for more than a year during the comet’s journey toward Mars from the outer solar system.
Three images  taken in 2013 on October 29 and in 2014 on January 21 and March 11  captured the comet when it was between 500 and 600 million kilometers away from Earth, and show its slow evolution as its volatile elements boil off in the sunlight.
Siding Spring’s nucleus is too small to be seen in these images, hidden within the comet’s nearly 20,000-kilometer-wide coma of gas and dust.
Unlike most comets we’re familiar with, which circle the sun in orbits of tens or hundreds of years, Comet Siding Spring’s orbit spans more than a million years, originating in the Oort Cloud, a spherical shell of icy debris at the outskirts of our solar system.
No comet direct from the Oort Cloud has ever been seen in such detail before.
Here, the HiRISE camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captures the first close-ups of Siding Spring’s nucleus, revealing it to be only a half-kilometer wide.
This composite image shows two of the best HiRISE snapshots of the comet, with each shot split in two.
The upper photos show Siding Spring’s nucleus and gassy inner coma, whereas the lower shots are more exposed, revealing the much fainter outer coma and the beginnings of the comet’s tail.
NASA’s Opportunity rover snapped this labeled image of Siding Spring shortly before daybreak on Mars, some two-and-a-half hours before the comet’s closest approach.

A cannon on Mars?
This high-resolution image from the Mars rover Curiosity, taken July 29, 2014, includes what some viewers describe as a small artillery cannon, seen on the left, just above the mid-point.
Can you see it?
Not exactly the first thing that comes to mind when you worry about a Martian attack.

You ve got to hand it to the dedicated souls -- both NASA professionals and armchair UFOlogists -- who pore over the stream of images from Mars rover cameras and find interesting stuff.
S.
Civil War.
The image was taken July 29 , or Sol 723 in terms of Martian days, by the Curiosity rover s right mastcam.
Some data is stored on board the two rovers and transmitted to Earth later, according to NASA.
The date on each picture is the date it was taken, not the date it was transmitted.
There s also a time stamp on the images, given in UTC  the initials for Coordinated Universal Time in French , similar to Greenwich Mean Time.
Looking at a whole page of thumbnails of the raw images is a tad overwhelming.
Yet, the global audience of Mars rover fans continues to scrutinize them with imaginative flair.
Look!
I found an iguana!
So far, the space agency hasn t weighed in on whether the image might depict a war cannon  they might be too busy laughing .
Other mysterious items spotted in Mars rover photos over the years include a toy boat, traffic light, thigh bone, two dinosaurs in one photo, a dot of light above the Martian hills as well as a shaft of light seeming to emanate from below the planet s surface, a face that is half-human and half-goat and a UFO in the atmosphere above the planet.
Curiosity landed on Mars Aug.
6, 2012.
The other Mars rover, Opportunity, landed Jan.
25, 2004, and has amazed scientists by continuing to operate for more than a decade.
Photos: Check out the slideshow above for other oddities seen in images from the Red Planet.

Since Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012, there have been several rumors that evidence has been found of Martian life in the forms of fossils, statues and even a carved alien skull and that NASA has  covered up  the existence of alien life on the planet.
Adding the list this week, NASA has denied claims that a flash of light in a photo taken by Curiosity, is proof that the rover has found alien life as rumored on many UFO websites.
The photos, taken by Curiosity on the 2nd and 3rd of April, show the rough Martian landscape and a single bright glint of light that looks like it might come from some sort of artificial source.
The  alien life  speculation empasized that there appears there is a square part at the base of the light, which seems inconsistent with any kind of natural explanation.
The spot of light also appears to be in different positions in each photo, possibly indicating a moving light source.
But NASA imaging scientist Justin Maki, who works at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ss head of the team looking after Curiosity’s engineering cameras, has denied the alien life rumors pointing out that the light appears only in the photo taken with the camera on the probe’s right-hand side suggesting that it s sunlight reflecting off a particular rock, or light that has found its way through the camera’s housing due to damage of some sort.
Mars rover mission s suggests that the light is due to cosmic rays bouncing off the camera’s detector or is simply a very “glinty” rock that has been caught by the rover.
This theory is supported by the fact that both photos are taken at a low angle looking up the ridge with the sun behind the rover.
The flash of light is off Curiosity s prescribed route, about 175 yards away, over the ridge, so the rover will not be investigating its source.
A fact certain to inspire further rumors of NASA cover up among the  Alien Life  proponents.
Thanks for your interesting comment Dr.
Burke.
I don t perceive NASA scientists to be  do nothing lazy friggen idiots  as you do.
That s essentially because landing complex computer driven rovers on an alien planet is a lot harder than most of us would suspect.
Next: like you: I do hope that the private sector will take over space exploration  companies like Space-X .
You bet I do!
But don t forget that private companies like Space-X are utilizing extensive technology developed by NASA over a few decades.
Those private space companies are NOT re-inventing the wheel: they are borrowing heavily from NASA s experience and technology designs, and NASA is sharing this information with them willingly.
Also, far from seeming  lazy  the NASA rover scientists often seem to be extremely highly motivated, frequently doing all nighters during critical mission times, and speaking to the press in highly motivated and excited tones.
Also I don t think many of us would be happy to see NASA  die , as you have wished upon them.
So much incredible and vital science  such as Voyager probes, lunar landings, Hubble deepspace imaging, depends upon NASA.
I won t even go over all the countless private sector spinoffs that have come to be, thanks to NASA.
NASA perfect?
Nope!
I believe they will continue to play an important role in the future of our species.
Cosmic rays  or a vent hole  are too implausible an explanation, because you basically need about 1 in a million coincidence to explain two flashes on the horizon  perpendicular to the horizon  on two consecutive days.
A rock reflection is also not a good explanation, because rocks are dull, non-reflective objects, and it is particularly unlikely that you would have such a powerful light reflection on Mars  where the sun looks smaller in the sky .
That doesn t mean that we have to invoke aliens, but simply that we don t yet have a good explanation  could be some odd geological thing .
Facebook page prompt me to urge you to seek professional help, in your quest for the  truth .
That is, if you believe your tinfoil hat gives you sufficient protection to venture outside.
Otherwise, perhaps you can find someone who is willing to come to your home, and personally measure you for a lovely new canvas jacket.
I hear the style, these days, is to make them with extra long sleeves which include buckles and straps.
Be careful not to get any drool stains on it, though.
Dry cleaning can get expensive.
It is always good to be analytic and watchful especially of government affiliated entities  well NASA is a gov funded organization, not exactly a gov entity but close but if intelligent life is to exist on Mars it s gonna have to breathe in very rare partial vacuum atmosphere, and breathe CO2 and sustain extremes in temperatures colder than Antartica, wading in frozen CO2 water slush and living in a drier than dry desert.
I m not taking sides with NASA but I think a bit of thought on the part of the hyper critics might reduce the uneducated hype that circulates on the Internet about all the space soap opras invented by shear stupidity and ignorance.
UFOs.
Yes, there most certainly has to be life and advance intelligent life in our Galaxy and a lot of it, granted, so it would not be surprising in the least of it was found visiting our own Solar system and Earth, but skulls on Mars and such can be tossed off as tabloid hype if you look at Mars  history as a failed too cold, too dry, too small not enough magnetic field radioactive as Hades planet.
It s good to study Mars in detail but I think it is way too expensive and risky to ever have a manned mission when a small fraction of the money spent could yield so much more info using robotics and no risk to human life.
Personally  for what its worth  my first impression was, and still is some geologic event such as steam?
Maybe a large Co2 discharge?
Either way and even if I m wrong  quite possible  seems worth redirecting the rover to go take a look.
Something happened!
That s for sure.
Isn t this type of event what were sort of there for in the first place?
I find it hard to believe that mission programmers won t consider taking a peek.
I thought that we  humankind  were exploring?
I know I m just a taxpayer.

Last week, NASA announced that the Mars rover Opportunity had stumbled upon a mysterious rock that seemed to appear out of nowhere .
While the rock did have quite a unique composition, it was likely knocked into place by the rover as it maneuvered around the area.
Rhawn Joseph is the petitioner in the case.
He has authored several books on a variety of topics, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, biological UFOs, and neuropsychology.
His views on the origin of life on Earth have been described as “ eccentric ” and he is connected to the Journal of Cosmology which has published papers dealing with extraterrestrial life on on more than one occasion.
The petition, filed in a California court, takes aim at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Chief Administrator Charles Bolden, calling for a writ of mandamus for NASA to investigate the “putative biological organism” more closely.
Apparently, Joseph feels that the mystery rock is not a rock at all, and it wasn’t randomly knocked into its present location.
Instead, according to the lawsuit, the object is actually an alien organism that was there the entire time, but grew over the course of those twelve Martian sols to its present size.
Joseph believes the object is actually a mushroom-like fungus that reproduces with spores.
His petition would demand that Opportunity take 100 close up, high definition snapshots from a variety of angles, along with 24 microscopic shots of various angles.
The petition would also require the images to be publicized and he would get direct access to them.
Yes, the rock’s composition was described by NASA as “ unlike anything  have seen before ,” but that hardly means it is more than a rock.

The minifigure is split into two parts: the upper body and the legs, both of which are transparent, glow-in-the-dark green .
The arms cannot move, but are stuck to the sides of the minifigure.
The head is also fixed in one spot.
In fact, the only spot where the alien can move is at the joint where the torso connects to the legs.
There is a hole in the Alien s chest that makes it capable of holding any LEGO object that fits inside, such as its jetpack .
The chain of command for the Aliens is as follows: Drone, Saboteur , Commander , and Queen .
It is stated that they are not from Mars, but came there to conquer it and mine out its Energy Crystals .
They possibly could have crashed there, as seen in LEGO Battles  though that could have been a separate ship and they simply invaded Mars .
They positioned themselves in the hive they built and are lead by Alien Commander , who is ultimately lead by the Alien Queen .
They often carry staffs that can project an energy blast.
Some of them wear jet packs  called Vipers  to move around the surface of Mars more swiftly.
In the end, however, they were driven off of Mars.
In CrystAlien Conflict , they are not translucent, but instead solid green.
What happened to the Martians that were there originally is unknown.
It is possible that they were driven into extinction or went into hiding or Mars Mission could be set in an alternative universe from Life on Mars .
It was jokingly said to be based of of the Sangheili species from the Halo universe.
The face does bear a striking resemblance.
Alien Weapon Found on Mars?
Check out our calendar for George Noory s public appearances in 2014.
An animal skull was observed in the images of the Mars Curiosity Rover and videos of it were uploaded on YouTube.
In the past, there have been many objects that were noticed in the Red Planet.
According to UFO Sightings Daily , the skull seemed to have upper teeth that looked similar to horse fossils on the Earth.
The video, titled  Mars: Blade In Jaw Bone. Clearest Alien Skull Seen So Far  had been uploaded on a YouTube channel that is handled by Joseph White called ArtAlienTV .
In a span of about five days, the video has garnered about 5,000 views and 19 comments.
A color mosaic taken by NASA s Mars Curiosity rover Mast Camera  mastcam  shows strata exposed along the margins of the valleys in the  Pahrump Hills  region on Mars in this undated handout photo courtesy of NASA.
After 18 months of driving, scientists on September 11, 2014, announced that Curiosity had arrived at the base of Mount Sharp ahead of schedule, thanks to a somewhat serendipitous decision to take an alternative path that would be gentler on the rover s damaged wheels.
Within two weeks, Curiosity will reach an outcrop of rock called Pahrump Hills, where the first drill samples of Mount Sharp real estate will be made.
Joseph White, in the description of the video, said that it was the clearest skull as well as the closest, large specimen that was found in the Red Planet that looked like there was a metal blade embedded in the jaw bone.
He suggested that it was a skull of a herbivore, possibly a dinosaur or mammal that was killed in the past.
He asked in the description if it could belong to the thigh bone that was found in August by a UFO enthusiast in the images of the Curiosity Rover.
He continued that the finding was an example of how it is easy to find objects when the rover took a close up image.
He said that it was easy to notice the details of the object, unlike the other ones in the past from the Curiosity Rover.
With the same name as his YouTube channel, Joseph White, has created a blog that has articles accompanied by his videos of all his findings.
On his blog, he said that people claimed that all the objects, ranging from animals to fossils, that were found on the Red Planet by the Curiosity Rover were said to be rocks because they had the same colour as that of their surroundings.
His explanation was that it wasn t rocks, but because of the object lying in dirt for thousands of years, it looked the way that it did.
He said that the images that were uploaded by NASA on their official site were mostly compressed but there were a few files that were of good quality.
He said that the good quality files is what he and the other enthusiasts observe to search for findings of various objects.

Those of us in the social grouping called Baby Boomers have seen an amazing era of history unfold right before our eyes.
Whether social, political or scientific, we were always right there on the cutting edge of change.
What luck it was to grow up during the 50 s and 60 s; when America went into space.
A great many of us followed the space program from its infancy with the Mercury program, on thru Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle: and the one constant factor was the repeated encounters our astronauts had with UFO s & extraterrestrials.
Many people believe that NASA is a civilian organization, but they re wrong, it s a 100% pure government operation, and as such has always had a policy of keeping the whole extraterrestrial subject under wraps.
This tight lipped secrecy about what they found in space and on the moon has many of us believing their name stands for Never A Straight Answer!
Despite decades of censorship; a wealth of radio, photographic & video evidence exists in data available to the media, to verify such encounters repeatedly over the years.
Just look at the hundreds of American military bases scattered across this planet and you ll see why it s also a good idea on the galactic scale.
Those who have followed the ET issue with any real interest are likely aware that there are actually several different races of aliens commonly visiting this world , which makes the idea of bases even more reasonable to consider.
There have been reports of alien bases right here on earth, and under the oceans, so why wouldn t there also be such alien made structures elsewhere in the solar system?
Galactic truck stops.
To be sure, we paid dearly for our successes in space, with the lives lost in various disasters, but we always continued on, even after Challenger & Atlantis were lost, we kept going, kept reaching for the stars, until it stopped suddenly and the manned space program was ended, without a successor program in place to keep going.
I for one, took it as personal & intellectual insult when the program was executed like a condemned prisoner.
Of course NASA is still very much in business with the ultra secret shadow space program .
S.
Why is there a marine who claims to have spent over ten years on a secret base on Mars?
The notion of alien moon bases is in resurgence recently with such movies as Apollo 18 & Iron Sky, as well as a recent SyFy channel production,  Aliens on the Moon   full video below  which relied heavily on the books, ULO s Unidentified Lunar Objects revealed in NASA photography by Alan Sturm and Somebody else is on the Moon by George Leonard.
When viewed together the photographs from these two books are certainly compelling if for no other reason than God doesn t build in straight lines!
The Apollo program was scheduled for 20 missions to the moon, yet that program was halted abruptly also, after the 17th mission.
Why did we suddenly decide not to return to the moon?
There has to be a reason we gave up the plan to eventually build bases on the moon; was it because someone else was already there ?
NASA sent a lot of hardware and cameras into lunar orbit, so why are there no images from the far side of the moon, the one which never faces earth?
The pretext of the movie Iron Sky was the presence on the moon of Helium3 which is in fact a true thing.
On the entire earth there are only about 15 tons of helium3, but on the moon there are over 5 million tons of the stuff.
Interesting also that He3 is a clean and efficient nuclear reactor fuel!
The regolith covering the moon is full of He3.
Employing something called the Drake equation we can calculate the approximate number of advanced space faring extraterrestrial races in the milky way galaxy; and there are literally hundreds, if not thousands of them.
We are not alone.
Those advanced space faring races come in five basic types according to the Kardashev Scale.
Type I civilizations harness every possible available power source from solar, wind, hydrothermal, geothermal, tidal and even earthquakes.
Resources are used in an elegant manner without pollution or waste.
They are not at the mercy of planetary weather because they control it.
Type II civilizations exploit & use the energy of stars themselves to power their needs, and Type III civilizations harness the energy of an entire galaxy.
Type IV civilizations exceed technology and resonate with the environment and reality around them.
Then there are the Type V civilizations: which are more like Ultraterrestrials.
They are similar to the type IV except they are of much longer duration, and have a deeper awareness of the continuuium and interdimensional travel.
Although UFO encounters were documented during most, if not all manned space flights, Apollo 11 afforded a wealth of evidence in voice transmissions, and photography.
Some sources even claim the astronauts made contact with an alien race on the moon.
Perhaps the most remarkable of the photos from the Apollo 11 mission is the one which clearly shows a detailed saucer shaped craft landed on the lunar surface.
Although Armstrong probably took the picture, or was present when it was taken, it seems so odd that he refused to comment on the photo, or even look at it when asked in a filmed interview included in the SyFy program Aliens on the Moon .
It seems pretty clear to me that something extraordinary occurred during that Apollo mission, and that it s still being kept a secret 45 years on, as we nostalgically observe the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing this month.
NASA and the government contend that such secrets must be kept from the public; because if humanity learned of ET races in our solar system we would all quit our jobs and go on some kind of rampage which would bring down society, religion and Wal-Mart.
More likely is they keep such deep dark secrets because they fear their loss of authority if everyone knew these races were operating at will in our solar system; and  the Authorities  were helpless to stop it, or worse yet were actually working with ET s.
Apollo 14 reportedly flew over the moon s polar region and saw rows of spacecraft parked, and the abandoned remains of a city with circular buildings and very tall towers.
Apollo 15 captured an image clearly depicting a cigar shaped craft on the moon s surface near the Delporte crater.
Apollo 16 took detailed pictures of vehicle tracks, a  bridge  and a radar dish in the Mare Crisium crater.
Four years later, in 1976 NASA reportedly sent an international crew to the moon, designating the flight Apollo 20.
The crew consisted of pilot Leona Snyder, former astronaut William Rutledge and Russian cosmonaut Alexi Lenov.
Their destination was the Delporte crater, and their mission was to explore the cigar shaped craft photographed by Apollo 15!
As the story goes, the crew of Apollo 20 explored the alien craft, and also discovered a large city, and of all things a preserved alien girl.
Some years later William Rutledge surfaced on the internet with a collection of videos & photos purportedly taken during the Apollo 20 mission.
As with most fantastic tales, this one bears the hybrid marks of having some truth, and some sensationalism as well, regards the alien mummy girl; and it would not be the first time the powers that be tried to diffuse the truth with just the right amount of not-so-true.
When the Russians sent their Zond-3 probe to explore the far side of the moon in 1965, they photographed a dome type structure, and a 22 mile high spire or tower.
Could these structures have anything to do with why we abandoned our long range plans to dominate the moon?
Were we warned not to return?
Every expert will tell you that whoever controls the moon also controls the earth; so why did the American military-industrial complex just give up on the prize it wanted so much?
Who owns the moon?
So, NASA turned it s attention and efforts towards the mysterious red planet Mars, since they had plans to travel there as well, and right away there were signs that others had gotten there first.
Once the picture went public NASA of course debunked clear photographic evidence by saying it was a trick of light, or maybe swamp gas; it was they said, anything but what it looked like.
As I said, Never A Straight Answer from that bunch.
Over the years the debate just wouldn t go away, the public clamored for more photos from Cydonia but they never came, until 2001 when the Mars Global Surveyor satellite again photographed the face on Mars .
The new pictures of course bore small resemblance to the original owing no doubt to NASA air brushers & photoshoppers.
We have mystified and marveled over Mars for a long time, being the nearest inhabitable world in the solar system we wonder in awe and perhaps just a little dread if there be life there.
G.
Wells synthesized our fears so well in his novel War of the Worlds that it remains a classic which has spawned no less than six feature films.
Just like the moon; NASA has similar long range plans for Mars, including a colony eventually, and yet once again there are disturbing indications that someone else is already there.
Of all Mars missions attempted by various countries over the years, 23 have disappeared or failed upon reaching the orbit of Mars!
23 failures, seems a lot.
The Martian moon Phobos is the crown jewel as it would make an excellent base from which to launch future missions deeper into the solar system.
S.
The 1989 Russian Mars probe Phobos-2 seemed to come under direct attack by a UFO which either rammed it or shot it down.
How about this photograph apparently showing the ruins of some structure of intelligent design.
Then there is the photo some say is the fossilized body of an ET on Mars.
Of course we can examine our own planet as well for signs of ET activity with Google earth.
There exists a vaster reality out there, beyond the hobbling explanations from NASA and the government; it s a world Neil Armstrong alluded to during his speech at the 25th anniversary of the first moon landing.
He spoke of the veils of secrecy being lifted, and that there were so many amazing places yet to explore.
His words sounded so very sad to me; like a man who had seen that vaster reality with his own eyes and could not understand why we walked away from it.
That vaster reality is still all around us, every day and indications are that the long awaited Disclosure about ET s may be at hand sooner, rather than later; just something to think about.
Thinking about ET s and alien bases in our solar system may be uncomfortable for some, so they write it off as nutters exercising their free speech.
Who can know, and that s just the point; knowledge is power!
My suggestion would be that as long as you re holding a camera phone, quit photographing your food, and turn your focus to the unlimited universe all around you, Feed your head!

A flying saucer buzzes around the opening Warner Brothers logo.
The best movie of all time.
Or maybe one of the worst.
This is one of these movies you absolutely like or absolutely dislike.
I liked it, sure.
It s such a sarcastic view of America: its people, its government, its army, its television, its culture, everything and everyone falls under Tim Burton s incredible axe.
Many talented stars gather for an incredible script.
It is unbelievably funny, absurd and full of contradictions and nuttiness.
It s like a mixture of Star Wars, Animaniacs and the Clockwork Orange.
For sure, you will like it a lot and believe it is the best movie you have ever seen or you won t understand a thing and feel disappointed.
If you like Jim Carrey or Brad Pitt, please go and choose another movie.

We look for repeated parallel lines, 90 degree corners, repeated equal spacing, repeated curves, centered objects on flat foundations, pathways that actually lead to entrances, roadways, etc.
Notice the even step downs, and how the wall remains the same width with each step down.
This is not natural whatsoever, it is the result of intelligent planning for whatever reason this structure was built.
There are a multitude of other structures, some very ancient, some very modern, but all of them display the same repeated patterns of artificial design.
Denial of the obvious does not make it go away.
Turning the head away from the truth is not the method that should be employed by science or investigators.
WE ARE NOT ALONE, AND SOMEONE EITHER IS, OR HAS BEEN ON MARS.

Is the truth really out there?
A NASA picture of a mysterious bright light on Mars has sparked the interest of UFO believers.
Maki explained that the bright spots appear in single images taken by the Navigation Camera on NASA s Curiosity Mars rover s right-eye but not its left.
In the right-eye images, the spot is in different locations and is seen at the ground surface level in front of a crater rim on the horizon.

The picture was captured on April 3 by the right-hand navigation camera on NASA s Mars Curiosity rover.

Has NASA s Curiosity rover found alien body parts on Mars?
THE Curiosity rover s lonley voyage across Mars  barren landscape could soon come to end, with the robot having seemingly found an object that looks uncannily like a metal arm.
Life on Mars?
Internet conspiracy theorists have been sent into a frenzy over the image, with speculation heightening over the idea that alien life has been found on Mars.
5cm metal spoke protruding out of a rock.
So, what is the strange sight?
A robotic arm?
A tool of some kind?
An alien spaceship?
According to reports, NASA don t actually know what the mysterious object is.
Meanwhile, the bot has been busy trying out its drill in the alien rock for the first time.
The rover had previously used just the hammer action on the tool, but it has now progressed to operating the device in a rotary mode as well.
New pictures sent back from the robot show a small, shallow, rounded hole that is surrounded by fine tailings.
Soon, Curiosity will be commanded to drill up to 5cm into rock to obtain a powdered sample that can be delivered to the vehicle s onboard labs.
The rover is investigating whether past environments at this location could ever have supported life, and getting inside rocks to analyse their chemistry will provide some of the most telling evidence.
The rover’s Twitter account tweeted, “Knock, knock, knocking on Mars.
See the mark I left by a percussion test; necessary prep for drilling”.

A self-described astrobiologist is asking a federal judge to compel NASA to take a closer look at a mysterious Martian object.
Rock, pastry, fungus?
You decide.
That martian   jelly doughnut   rock that shook a solar system when it appeared before the Mars rover Opportunity in a spot where days before there had just been dirt?
Biological UFOs.
Evidence for Extraterrestrial Extremophiles.
NASA says the rock was likely flipped into the rover s field of view by its wheels as it was maneuvering around the area, but Joseph -- who filed suit this week in a Northern California US district court -- is calling poppycock.
Joseph goes on to claim that the object could not have simply appeared in the later images, because it s also in the earlier images taken of the same spot.
He explains that a smaller version of the fungus can be seen in the same location in the early images of the location, and that it then grew to its current breakfast-pastry-like appearance.
It is the Petitioner s impression that spores were exposed to moisture due to changing weathering conditions on Mars.
Over the next 12 days these spores grew and developed into the structure depicted  in the later  jelly doughnut  images .
As evidence, he provides magnified, pixelated images of either a nightmare that I once had translated into 8-bit, or a Martian fungus germinating -- it s a little hard to tell which it might be.
Clear evidence of a cover-up?
Or just some pixels?
Any intelligent adult, adolescent, child, chimpanzee, monkey, dog, or rodent with even a modicum of curiosity, would approach, investigate and closely examine a bowl-shaped structure which appears just a few feet in front of them when 12 days earlier they hadn t noticed it.
But not NASA and its rover team who have refused to take even a single close-up photo.
The idea might not really be as crazy as it sounds, given recent discoveries that the ingredients for life could just be floating all around space, but there s just one problem with Joseph s line of thinking: NASA did take a closer look.
We have looked at it with our microscope.
Steve Squyres, who heads the Mars rover project, said during a recent news conference .
And for the record, that news conference took place days before Joseph filed his complaint on Monday, so it s likely not part of a cover-up in response to the filing.
Oh well, I guess my local haute cuisine establishment is just going to have to wait a little longer to be able to serve the finest Martian mushrooms.
We re all still stuck with kale in the meantime.
Remember that face that was seen on Mars?
A keen UFO believer says he has found faces and structures on Mercury in Nasa photos that prove that life exists on the red-hot planet.
Scott Waring, a teacher living in Taiwan who has authored a few books  on UFOs, time travel and young adult fantasy fiction, also runs a website called UFO Sightings Daily  for the international UFO believer community.
His website documents UFO sightings of all kinds, including things spotted in footage sent back to earth from Nasa rovers and space probes, and he claims to have found structures on Mercury that prove that extra-terrestrial life exists in grainy, barely distinguishable black and white photographs.
Most people seem so preoccupied with Mars that everyone forgets there are other planets and moons we need to search.
In 1976, photos taken from the Viking 1 spaceship revealed what looked like a face on Mars .
Waring says that the shadows in the photos are hidden because the Mariner 10 space probe s camera has different filters and takes infrared photographs that are able to cut through shadows, revealing a  honeycomb-like structure   see top image  typical to the  people of planet Mercury  that cannot be seen in normal photos of Mercury.
By zooming the photographs in to 300% in size, he claims that there are structures hiding in the inner sides of at least seven craters, which are in darkness due to the position of Mercury in relation to the sun.
He has discovered a  crown jewel , a black cube on the surface of the planet.
Being a cube and in the position it s in, it s clearly a structure that was made by intelligence and it s portable.
There are also structures in the shape of a  thumbs up  on Mercury.
Similar to Mars, Waring has seen a multitude of ancient-looking faces on Mercury, as well as on other planets, but he is much less confident about what the faces mean, compared to the structures.
The faces] are not that important.
Are they faces from their pasts?
Are they faces intermingling with their culture?
It s very confusing.
There is one face though, that Waring says he has seen come up in many Mercury photos, time and again  see video above .
The face has a large upper lip and  looks like a Neanderthal , with a strong nose and deep chin.
I don t expect you to see the face unless you ve had a good eye in art.
Waring states.
Waring s excitement about the possibility of extra-terrestrial life on Mercury is palpable, and he hopes that he will one day get to meet these beings.
To our neighbours on Mercury, please announce yourselves to the people on Earth.
They are as ready as they will ever be.
You know that s true.
We are linked.
Your people and mine are akin to the stars.
We can t come to you, but you can come to us.
Can you see the structures and faces Waring has mentioned?
Let us know in the comments below.
Conspiracy theorists have identified what they claim to be a  skull  on the surface of Mars.
The oddly shaped object - which is overwhelmingly likely to be a funny-shaped rock - was discovered in a picture taken by the $2 billion Curiosity rover, and posted to the web by Nasa.
UFO Sightings Daily , our favourite repository of just-about readable alien fervour.
Compare both skulls and you will see a lot in common.
The eye socket, nasal cavity, behind and above eye bone ridge.
The image in question is still on Nasa s website .
Nasa hasn t issued a comment yet, because this is a rock.
Oh, NASA rover Curiosity, you make us so curious.
Curious about images like this, which appear to show either camouflaged or fossilized lizards running around on Mars.
A blogger caught this image, what do you think?
OK, this really does look like some sort of rodent.
NASA s Mars rover Curiosity shot a photo of this little guy earlier this year.
But after a closer look, and a little common sense, it s probably a rock.
The rock rats and rock lizards have begun to breed.
Oh no.
It s too late.
The rock rat lizards are already here.
The Internet has long been crazy about this photo, snapped by the NASA rover Spirit.
She has a terrible choice in dress color though, doesn t she?
The conspiracies go back to July 25, 1976, when this shot of the  Face on Mars  was taken by an orbiter.
Do you believe yet?
Awwww.
These are real photos taken of Mars  surface.
But were they designed by extraterrestrials who know the human concept of love?
Only the ETs know.
If it s a skull, it appears to have several eye sockets, a nose, and an embarrassingly large forehead.
If it s a rock, it s probably not even a rock.
LOBSTER!

NASA’s Curiosity rover recently rolled to a new vantage point on  Mars Mars and started snapping photos to send home, and one shot seems to show that some underground-dwelling martians may have left the porch light on.
At least that’s where the Internet’s well-established communities of UFO spotters immediately focused their speculation, leading Doug Ellison of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab to do some immediate debunking via Twitter.
Ellison points out that the eerie light, which really does appear to be emanating from a hole in the planet’s surface, does not appear in a second image of the same spot taken at the same moment by another of the rover’s cameras.
Ellison says rather than subterranean Martian condos, the strange light can likely be blamed on stray cosmic rays that can sometimes be seen in space.
0yle It’s not in the left-Navcam image taken at the exact same moment.
It’s a cosmic ray hit.
Cosmic rays are basically high-energy subatomic particles of unknown origin that float through space.
Astronauts have reported spotting flashes of light attributed to cosmic rays going back as far as the early Apollo missions.
Of course, the more conspiracy minded among us dismiss this explanation as part of a cover-up involving the discovery of alien life, or maybe lizard people or something.
The same holds true for anything odd or even slightly out of place that Curiosity happens to catch sight of.
A few months back, an out of place rock that was moved by contact with Curiosity’s wheels sparked speculation that the rock was actually some sort of growing, fungus-like organism.
One self-proclaimed astrobiologist even went so far as to file a motion with a federal court in an attempt to compel NASA to release the “truth” about the strange rock.
NASA has yet to issue a formal response to the light spot.
Curiosity will continue to check out its new environment at “ The Kimberley ” waypoint in the meantime.
UPDATE: NASA has now responded in a blog post about the light.
In the thousands of images we’ve received from Curiosity, we see ones with bright spots nearly every week,” said Justin Maki of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who leads the team that operates the camera in question.

Flynn s other research!
UFOs & the Bible, Aliens & 33 Symbolism?
David Flynn  s original research regarding the link between Roswell, Mt.
Herman, UFOs & the Bible is available below.
Flynn s DVD lecture series & Flynn s book  Cydonia  chronicle the influence of the interdimensional beings known as Aliens, Rebel Angels, Nephilim & the Fallen Ones on human civilization.
The numbers 13 & 33 are the Illuminated  Stamp of Approval  in the Mystery Schools throughout the ages, and one finds that these numbers occur in UFO folklore & conspiratorial coverups from THEM.
End of the Age - Return of the Nephilim?
The book of  Jubilees remarks that Jared or Yeh-red , an Old Testament patriarch, was so called because in his days the angels descended upon the earth - Yaw-rad  descend  .
It is interesting to note that  Jordan  comes from that same root word denoting  descent, coming down or falling  - Yar-dane  the place of the descent  .
The source of the Jordan river is Mount Hermon - the point of descent of the Watchers.
Mt.
Hermon resides in the ancient land formally known as  Sidonia .
The super-human angelic beings descended, created hybrid offspring with human women, the  nephilim  and mighty men of renknown preserved in ancient myths.
The source for the dispersion of angelic  alien  technology, and the Hermetic knowledge that influenced human civilization since the days of Noah, was Sidonia   Cydonia.
UFO sightings increase as 2012 approaches - significant?
The Milky Way Galaxy is the inspiration for the symbol of the Ouroboros.
Hermeticism and myth refer to a serpent of light residing in the heavens.
The Milky Way is this serpent, and viewed at galactic central point near sagittarius, this serpent eats its own tail.
The Milky Way galaxy keeps a great time cycle that ends in catastrophic change.
The sign of the SUNTELIA AION is the sun rising out of the mouth of the oroborus, which  will occur on the solstice December 2012.
In  Temple at the Center of Time:  Newton s Bible Codex Finally Deciphered and the Year 2012  David Flynn uses clues found in illuminated literature and ancient myth, as well as his knowledge of the Bible in the original languages as Isaac Newton did, researching ancient texts that Isaac Newton had access to, and examining the works of Isaac Newton dealing with End Time Prophecy especially found in the Books of Daniel and Revelation or The Apocalypse.
Flynn asserts that although Newton had solved riddles of space, time, gravity, light, physics & mathematics, Newton seemed to be looking for  proof that God is in control of the universe .
Flynn s book demonstrates how pivotal events in history are unquestionably connected in time and space to Jerusalem.
In  Temple at the Center of Time  one may find not only research into why such a great  scientific mind  as Newton s would be obsessed by the Biblical End Times, but also insite into such fascinating topics as the placement and purpose of ancient megaliths like Baalbek and Avebury, and why there is a significance placed on the galactic event which will occur on December 21, 2012.
WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON FLYNN  S 5 HOUR DVD SET 2003-2005?
The oroboros was used in traditions of hermeticism, occultism, gnosticism, alchemy, secret societies & illuminated fraternities like Freemasons & Rosicrucians.
This serpent symbolism referred to the fateful CELESTIAL CLOCK -- the Milky Way as viewed from the earth -- which has as its  hour and minute hands  the zodiac as powered by the precession of the equinox.
Flynn  s lectures from 2003-2005 demonstrate how symbolism has kept secret, yet preserved, the knowledge of the heavens, and how it pertains to our modern age, as we approach the END OF THE AGE IN 2012.
5 HOUR DVD SET: FLYNN  S 2008 PRESENTATION ON MYTH, SYMBOLISM, 2012 AND THE END OF THE AGE.
This almost four hour DVD set contains David Flynn s newest material, building on the research presented in the previous DVD lectures and Flynn s first book  Cydonia ... .
This 2008 series delves further into a potential signifcant prophetic occurance in the near future, an examination of the growing public fascination with the date December 21, 2012, and continues into the realm of mystical toponomy, the significance of Solomon  s Temple within hermeticism and freemasonry, and the location of the Temple in Jerusalem in the works of Isaac Newton, who was obsessed with deciphering the prophecies in Daniel & John  s Apocalypse concerning the end times.

Conspiracy theorists have suggested a photo captured by Nasa’s Mars Curiosity rover could indicate an alien presence on the surface.
The image taken on the Red Planet on April 3 seems to show a bright light shining on the horizon.
Some people subsequently claimed the glimmer was from something or someone on the ground.
Is the light in the distance alien life?
This could indicate there there is intelligent life below the ground and uses light as we do,’ wrote UFO Sightings Daily editor Scott C Waring.
But this suggestion has been disputed by Doug Ellison, who works as an imaging expert for Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL .
He told NBC the light was probably a cosmic ray hit, which occurs when the surface is struck by energy particles.
1976.
Photographs taken by NASA s 1976 Viking space probe show what appears to be a humanoid face in the Cydonia region of the planet Mars.
In addition there appear to be other manufactured items, or artifacts.
These other artifacts appear to be large pyramids and other structures.
They were discovered by NASA scientists who closely examined thousands of photographs using modern computer technology not available in 1976 when the photos were taken.
The key scientist investigating this phenomena is a fellow by the name of Richard Hoagland.
Although some conventional scientists deride his conclusions, his work has been extraordinary.
He has been supported by many scientists and engineers at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL  in Pasadena, CA.
In fact, I was present during one of his presentations when some scientists from JPL walked up and handed him high-resolution photos of Mars, showing clearly that intelligent life forms had built structures there.
One of them said to Hoagland,  We were wondering when you were going to see this.  Referring to the fact that Hoagland had already identified many other  built  structures on Mars and the moon.
Hoagland has spent over ten years investigating Martian and Lunar photos using computer-enhancement technology.
Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft.
Hoagland has been invited on several occasions to present his findings to the United Nations.
N.
Hoagland is a legitimate and brilliant scientist who worked for NASA for many years.
He was one of the originators of the  Calling Card  plaque that was first put on the Pioneer 10 space probe.
The plaque describes humans, our science, culture and where we are located to any beings who may come in contact with the probe.
Van Flandern based his conclusions on new analysis of the existing data.
In case you were asleep, late in 1995 and again in mid 1996, NASA  lost  two more space probes.
No explosion, no explanation, just lost!
The stories of these lost probes were carried in the back pages of most American newspapers.
It s the old disinformation technique of telling people the absolute truth, but doing it in such a way that no one will believe it.
Just so you know, NASA has mapped over 90 percent of the total surface of Venus.

A well written book with lots of photographs to support the text.
I think that every person should get a copy of this book and read it.
It s way past time for those of us who have been paying the bill for NASA to explore the solar system to demand that they come clean with what they have been finding over the past half century.
We can t allow them to continue to hide what s out there by air brushing photos, lying and ignoring the evidence that has found since Apollo and continues to be found even today.
There s a cover-up going on and it s time to blow the lid off.
Evidence of an advanced civilization that inhabited our solar system in the past seems to be strewn all over Mars and the Moon.
1.
When was this civilization active?
2.
Where were they from?
3.
Who were they?
4.
What happened to them and when?
5.
Are at least some of them still here watching us?
6.
Last but not least: If NASA knows these answers already, why won t they tell the American public who paid for the toys they use to go take a look?

This book could have used an index and larger pictures.
But, oh those pictures!
This is a absolute must read for anyone interested in the “anomalies” on the surface of Mars.
I had to read it all in only two sittings; it was too interesting to put down.
The author presents compelling evidence for the artificiality of these structures on the Red Planet.
THERE MAY BE ACTIVE SITES AS WELL!
THE BROOKINGS REPORT IS OBSOLETE!
The world won’t end if you release everything you are hiding about extraterrestrials, UFOs, ruins on Mars, etc.
People will not automatically panic at such revelations because there are so many books, videos, websites, etc.
SO PLEASE STOP HIDING THE INFORMATION AND RELEASE THIS DATA AND SEND PROBES  preferably manned  TO MARS, THE MOON, ETC.
TO CHECK OUT THESE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES AND TELL THE PUBLIC ALL ABOUT THEM AND WHAT IS FOUND.
Concerning Carl Sagan’s statement: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence”.
WHY?
How do you tell if something is an “extraordinary claim”?
What is meant by “extraordinary evidence”?
The statement is too ambiguous and can be “interpreted” in many different ways.

This is probably the best written book on the subject of hard evidence revealing an extraterrestrial presence in our solar system.
The author calls out mainstream scientists , the media, as well as NASA and the European Space Agencies for their extremely narrow minded attention to what should be obviously the greatest discovery of all time.
Is there a worldwide governmental conspiracy to withhold this information from the public?
It would certainly seem to be the case, based upon the mounting evidence!
I highly recommend this book.
It is a real eye opener.
Thank you for your feedback.

If one is interested in this sort of thing, that being the existence of ETs, UFOs, ancient ET civilizations, and all of its possibilities, then this is a good book for you.
There are many photos and their interpretations, though in B&W, and some will make you think, that is for sure.
Mr.
Craig is careful, but I believe that he presents a good case for the possible existence of an ancient, lost civilization of Mars or that of ancient alien bases on Mars.
Coming from my experiences in the USAF SAC, as an officer assigned to Top Secret ESI duties during the Cold War against the old Soviet Union, cover ups, lies, disinformation and misinformation, and old fashioned deceit is sometimes very real within our country.
From what I have seen over the last 43 years, NASA is a master, at lying to the American Public, as to what it has seen and been involved with since its inception in 1959.
Only a fool or a very dogmatic person would still believe the stories, lies, distortions, and devious behavior of NASA.
And all this deception and cover ups have nothing to do with the former Soviet Union.
Thank you for your feedback.
If this review is inappropriate, please let us know.

This book proves to me that something must be going on; that most people do not understand that the truth has likely been withheld from them.
The implications put out by this book uncover an iceberg of inquiry.
What has happened to space advancement?
And NASA, are they really Never A Straight Answer?
Photographic evidence of the Moon, Mars, and other locations seem to indicate that the controversial statements put out by certain brave individuals holds true.
Our understanding of our origins, and the presence and influence of past events, may have been  or may be  forgotten or rewritten.
Bear with the lengthy introductory and speculative questioning contained in about 30% of the material, and you are left with a well-organized work of writing that should be considered by everyone.
I want to believe.

Mounted to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it floats high above the red planet is the HiRISE telescope, an imaging device capable of taking incredibly high-resolution photos of the martian landscape.
It s sent back nearly 30,000 photos during its time above the planet, which have been used by NASA to find clear landing spots for rovers, and by researchers to learn more about the features of Mars  surface.
The stunning views captured by HiRISE have inspired a book from the publisher Aperture, called This is Mars , which includes 150 of its finest looks at the planet.
The entire collection is in black and white, however, as that s how HiRISE s images naturally turn out.
But by combining different color filters on the telescope, NASA is able to produce colored versions of most images too.
They re known as  false color  images, since they won t perfectly match up with what the human eye would see.
False color images are still useful, however, in helping researchers distinguish between different elements of Mars  landscape.
They re also downright gorgeous to look through.
Below, we ve collected our own series of some of the most incredible sights taken by HiRISE throughout 2013.

Mars has long been a source of fascination for those who seek life off the Earth.
Early astronomers noted seasonal changes: the normally red surface of the planet could be seen to develop darker, greenish patches during the Martian ‘summer’, as the polar ice caps melt.
They darken annually  in Martian terms  and always in the same patterns; in some years, they are more intense than others.
This suggested the existence of plant growth to many astronomers before satellite exploration would suggest otherwise.
The twenty-two close-up photographs sent back by Mariner 4 in July 1965 showed a cratered surface with a thin atmosphere  largely composed of carbon dioxide at a pressure of 5 to 10 mbar .
Later missions  especially Mariner 9 in 1971, Vikings 1 and 2 in 1976, Mars Global Surveyor since 1997 and Mars Pathfinder in 1997  have shown a dead planet without liquid water, suffering freezing temperatures and swept by violent winds.
Nevertheless, they have also shown that conditions were once very different, with evidence for plate tectonics  no longer functioning , river channels, ocean shorelines and an atmosphere formerly richer in oxygen.
This has led some researchers to suggest that not only life, but also an advanced civilisation may once have existed on Mars.
The part of Mars that has attracted most attention since satellite exploration of the planet began is the Cydonia Mensae region, located in the planet’s northern hemisphere.
The region bears traces of former shorelines – it is now accepted by most astronomers that Mars was once home to large bodies of water – and of eroded hills and mountains, corresponding to terrestrial buttes and mesas.
A number of features were seen on Viking Orbiter photographs from the mid 1970s that led some researchers to suggest that they were artificial in origin.
One of the most impressive parts of this claim was the concentration of anomalies in a single area; these anomalies included what was claimed to be an enormous carved face, three- and five-sided pyramids showing bilateral symmetry and walled compounds.
Moreover, some of these features appeared to be in alignment with each other.
The so-called ‘Face’ has attracted most attention.
The ‘Face’ has been known as that since NASA engineers dubbed it such as a convenient shorthand.
45° W, it was photographed by the Viking Orbiter 1 on 25 July 1976 whilst obtaining images of a site suitable for Viking Lander 2.
Eighteen images of the region were taken, but of these, eleven have resolutions worse than 550 m per pixel  in other words, no feature less than 550 m across can be seen on these images .
Only two of them  frames 070A13, taken on 24 August 1976, and 035A72, taken on 20 July 1976  have resolutions of better than 50 m per pixel.
They show a subrectangular elevated feature that displays roughly bilateral symmetry similar to a human face.
5 km and the height as about 400 m.
The long axis of the face is aligned at a bearing of approximately 329° to the Martian North Pole.
In Frame 070A13, the sun is 28° above the horizon, while in 035A72, it is 11°; these differences in angle reveal slightly different details in the ‘Face’.
The ‘Face’ lies close to the boundary between an area of flat-topped mesas and conical hills to its south-west, and a much flatter region in which it lies.
Claims have been made for the presence of a former shoreline close to the ‘Face’, which may be important in considering its likely origin.
Erosion is generally cited as the main factor in the creation of the landforms in this region, but a variety of claims were made during the 1980s and 90s that this was not sufficient to explain a number of features of the ‘Face’.
The original view of astronomers was that the northern past of Mars had originally been covered with a sediment that subsequently eroded, perhaps as a result of wind action.
As evidence for the former presence of surface water on the planet has increased, so it has begun to seem more likely that the erosion in this region may have been exacerbated by former seas.
The initial announcement of the discovery of this feature dismissed it as being “formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth”.
The public took little notice of it until DiPietro and Molenaar published an analysis of the formation in 1982, in which they concluded that it was artificial.
Since then, a number of popular writers have taken up the theme, most notably Richard Hoagland and Graham Hancock.
The widespread availability of computers for processing digital images from the mid-1980s onwards led to a great deal of amateur work on the Viking Orbiter photographs.
Different techniques for enhancing the photographs have been used, including techniques that attempt to deduce three-dimensional shape from shadows, the interpolation of pixels and so on.
These techniques were all used to make the ‘Face’ appear more detailed and more humanoid than on the original satellite images.
The ‘Face’ has become an iconic image, familiar to millions; its ghost-like features stare blankly from the covers of numerous books and videos.
Demands for photographs of higher quality than those of 1976 – with their resolutions of no better than 43 m per pixel – grew during the 1990s, especially when NASA announced the forthcoming launch of Mars Observer on 22 September 1992.
4 m per pixel, the probe was lost on 21 August 1993, three days before entering Martian orbit.
Predictably, the loss of the spacecraft prompted suggestions of conspiracy.
They can be discounted on the grounds of cost alone: had NASA wished to reassure the public that it was interested in finding out more about the face whilst being determined to prove it natural, it could have found a less expensive way of doing it than sabotaging a mission designed to obtain better photographs.
Indeed, the less expensive means is what the conspiracy theorists suggested about the results of the next probe, the Mars Global Surveyor: they declared the first photograph of the ‘Face’ obtained by the Mars Orbital Camera  Frame SPO-1-220 03  on 5 April 1998 to be fake.
The original release of the photograph in an unenhanced form ought to have reassured the public that NASA was being as fair as possible.
This prompted yet more claims of unfair play when Malin Space Systems  which had designed the camera  released an enhanced version on the following day, removing the more egregious sampling errors from the raw data.
The enhanced version shows none of the signs of artificiality alleged for the 1970s images, despite the claims of its supporters.
The 1998 image, unlike the Viking Orbiter images, is an oblique, with all the distortion that entails.
Even so, the ‘Face’ appears as a highly eroded ridge, with a steep perimeter.
A second photograph from the Mars Orbital Camera, taken on 3 June 2000 and released on 31 January 2001, shows only a small part of the ‘Face’, but it confirms the 1998 photograph in every respect.
This one, by contrast, is a near-vertical image.
Supporters of artificiality have subsequently focused on the bilateral symmetry of the object, with its central ridge  the nose  and the apparent valley below the nose  the mouth ; there is, however, no sign of a depression to the north-west of the south-western end of the ridge that would provide the missing ‘left eye’, nor does the ridge appear to be central to the mesa, confirming the lack of symmetry on the unprocessed version of Viking Orbiter image 070A13.
To explain the lack of resemblance to the original view of the ‘Face’ as a highly structured and artificial carving, they now have to accept either that it has suffered a great deal of erosion from its pristine form or that NASA has tampered with the photograph taken by the Mars Orbital Camera, as it was the identification of the pristine form that led to the claims for artificiality being made in the first place.
The ‘Face’ therefore emerges as an optical illusion  exactly as its discoverers in 1976 had claimed , known technically as pareidolia.
This is the phenomenon that allows believers to see an image of Mother Theresa in a cinnamon bun or the Arabic name of Allah in a sliced aubergine.
The basis of the illusion is the human brain’s tendency to make understandable and detailed patterns from vague stimuli; the same ability allows us to recognise melodies from short or distorted fragments and to see numbers in patterns of dots used for tests of colour blindness.
Faces are one of the first patterns the infant human learns to recognise, so it is unsurprising that a face-like mesa on Mars should be ‘read ; by so many as an actual representation of a human  or closely humanoid  face.
Close to the ‘Face’, DiPietro and Molenaar noticed a number of angular peaks.
Some of these appeared to be geometrically regular and they dubbed them ‘pyramids’.
One in particular, to the south-west, appeared to possess impressive geometric characteristics.
It can be seen on image 035A72, to the right of the ‘Face’ and a better view of it was obtained from image 070A13.
From the shadow, it can be calculated that the peak stands some 500 m above the surrounding plain.
Richard Hoagland dubbed it the D&M Pyramid, in honour of DiPietro and Molenaar, and the name has stuck.
The better photograph reveals it to be roughly pentagonal with apparent bilateral symmetry.
The supposed main axis points towards the ‘Face’; the south-west angle points towards the ‘city’ and the north-west angle towards a circular feature referred to as the ‘tholus’, named after its resemblance to the Tholos tombs of the Aegean Early Bronze Age.
A variety of mathematical relationships have been claimed for the angles and the ratios between them, involving the square roots of two and thee and the relationship e π.
These relationships are impressive, but they depend on an assumption that one face of the ‘pyramid’ has been damaged at some stage and that its shadowed face is as apparently smooth as the undamaged faces.
When viewed on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the ‘straight’ edges can be seen to diverge from their supposed lines by up to two pixels  which, at the resolution of this photograph, is equivalent to 86 m .
Moreover, the sides that ought to be of identical length for the ratios to be correct are not.
112 + 212   pixels or 1020 m.
This is a difference of almost 10%.
8  √ 72 + 302   pixels respectively  or 1170 m and 1325 m , a difference of more than 13%.
The calculations performed by Erol Torun are based on Mark Carlotto’s enhancement of the image, which interpolates data between pixels; the figures calculated here are based on the original data, lengths of side being calculated by applying Pythagoras’s Theorem to a direct count of pixels on Viking Orbiter frame 070A13.
The margin of error in each calculated length is not greater than one pixel, so even allowing for this  and therefore accommodating Carlotto’s enhancements , we cannot state that any two sides are of equal length.
The data, poor as they are, will simply not support the assertion.
On this basis, we can discount the geometric evidence supporting the contention that the ‘D&M Pyramid’ is an artificial construction.
Moreover, the same Mars Orbital Camera frame that rephotographed the ‘Face’ in 1998 also clipped the north-western corner of the ‘D&M Pyramid’.
This confirms the analysis of the Viking Orbiter frames, that there is no convincing evidence for artificiality whatsoever in the feature, even though only a small part of it is covered by the image.
The sides are not smooth in any sense, the base does not consist of straight lines, nor is there a sharp angle at the corner or between ‘faces’, at least on this part of the supposed monument.
In archaeological terms, the case can be considered closed.
To the north of the ‘Face’ lies an area dubbed ‘the city’ because of its supposed concentration of monuments.
These principally consist of further ‘pyramids’, generally with three or five faces and therefore quite unlike any human pyramids in Egypt or Mesoamerica.
The same general problems that attend the ‘D&M Pyramid’ apply here.
The supposed regularity of these structures vanishes once a careful count is made of pixel numbers on the raw images and allowance is made for the margin of error in pixel size  which is 47 m on this photograph, 035A72 .
Moreover, the Mars Orbital Camera reveals a mountain very similar to the ‘D&M Pyramid’.
At the extreme north-western end of the monuments is the so-called ‘fort’, which, in DiPietro and Molenaar’s enhancements, gains a row of cellular structures along its eastern edge.
They are too small to be visible on the original Viking Orbiter photograph, which means that no amount of enhancement can bring them out: they can only be artefacts of the enhancement process.
The Mars Orbital Camera rephotographed the ‘fort’ on three separate occasions, with it each time appearing as a low hill with erosion features that include apparently recent landslips.
Claims for artificiality have been made for several other sites on Mars, mostly in the Cydonia Mensae region.
The ‘tholus’ has already been mentioned, but there is little about its appearance to suggest an artificial origin.
11 m per pixel, makes it clear that the feature is entirely natural.
There appear to be perhaps three relict shorelines around the feature that suggest it was once an island in the shallow ocean thought to have existed in this area in the remote past.
There are also supposed to be further faces, an ‘Inca city’, runways and other features that cannot be explained in terms of geology.
Again, many of these turn out to be based on enhancements of the Viking Orbiter images that cannot bear the weight of interpretation placed on them.
Claims of this nature are not being made for the Mars Orbital Camera images, except for a few much smaller features that nevertheless also appear to be of geological origin.
Much of the debate revolves around those features picked out from the Viking Orbiter photographs as being anomalous.
There are at least two other claimed faces, in addition to the crater formation dubbed the ‘smiley face’ by NASA engineers keen to show that the original ‘Face’ was nothing more than an optical illusion.
Neither of the two supposedly artificial faces is of a size comparable with the Cydonia Mensae formation, nor is either of them more than vaguely similar to a human face.
Both are at very poor resolutions and both resemble pareidolic images of the face of Jesus seen in foliage.
Similarly, there have been claims for images of dolphins.
There is no need to examine these claims here, as most investigators outside the fringe have chosen to ignore them, and the claims rarely surface in the fringe literature  other than on websites whose content is often very bizarre .
Claims have also been made for the existence of pyramids in Elysium Regio, but they suffer from exactly the same problems as the pyramids of Cydonia Mensae: poor resolution on the Viking Orbiter images and Mars Orbital Camera images that does not support the artificiality hypothesis.
On the other hand, the Mars Orbital Camera is revealing all manner of curious and unexpected formations.
The Mars Sojourner roving vehicle also showed much the same sort of surface as the Viking landers had more than twenty years previously, but in greater detail and with the advantage of multiple perspectives.
What is significant about recent photographs from the planet is the lack of visible artificial monuments, especially claimed new ‘sites’.

If you really think that Hoagland has any credibility in examining evidence of artificiality from satellite imagery, then you are sorely mistaken.
I use “so-called” and “supposed” repeatedly to show that I’m dealing with unproven claims.
Keith, interesting site.
Difficult to take seriously though, when every reply, not to mention every article is written with a very condescending quality…even resorting to name calling I see.
Unfortunately, this is not the work or etiquette of serious scientists that I had hoped it would be.
I hear proponents on the other side of these issues questioning the standard academic conclusions, not insulting them.
If one cannot at least step back and just say “I don’t know but here is my idea or interpretation…” then I think you will lose many people on your hardline stance.
Fact of the matter is, interpretation and idea is the best we can do with various evidence from the past.
Good luck with your continuing studies.
Thanks for your response.
I try hard with my writing not to be condescending in the articles.
The effect I’m aiming for is something approaching a dispassionate, analytical approach.
At times it is difficult, especially when the ideas being propounded are so patently ridiculous, not to resort to mockery.
Yes, I have been goaded from time to time in name calling, but only when that’s what the person to whom I am responding has done.
It’s wrong of me, I know.
I may edit those responses to remove what was written in the heat of the moment.
What you don’t see are posts that I do not approve, which sometimes contain extremely abusive material about me.
I’ve had one in which the author  whose identity I suspect but cannot prove  has done a fair bit of research about me so that he can insult me, my employer, my past employers, my family, my personal life and so on.
That begins to wear one down.
I wish I could go to Mars!
As a child growing up in the 60s, I wanted to bean astronaut as well as an archaeologist.
One of the most important moments of my life was to be got out of bed in the early hours of 20 July 1969 to watch the landing of Apollo 11 live on television.
People are allowed to change their minds.
Science does that.
People also lie.
Scientists are also people.
I wouldn’t be slandering people based on disability status if I were you.
There could be scientists on this forum with neurological diseases who look up to Hawking because he is a survivor who has inspired a popular interest in the sciences, no matter the quality of his work  and some of that quality is fracking awesome, actually .
Now, if colour shifting occurred in Mars images, it might be for more reasons other than attempting to fabricate the appearance of Mars.
Although, fabricating that is possible, too.
An example could be the technology used to take the photographs.
You ought to know better than I do that imaging can be of non visible light spectrum and in doing so can show features that are distorted or blocked by something else.
MRIs do this, X rays and such.
Mars surface may well be blocked by some of the coverage that creates those violent winds and the sattelites are supposed to be in synchronous orbit, not under the atmospheric layers.
So those images won’t show in the original colour as we understand it.
Just like the images above.
Recalculating the waveforms into the visual spectrum is a complex task and errors and debate about method can occur without deliberate attempts at fabricating the evidence.
As for NASA accountability, it is not the only group involved in space exploration these days.
The cold war is over.
It could be more accountable, as could anyone and anything these days.
But NASA seems pretty keen on sharing what it learns in almost real time – such as watching Venus transit last year on the internet.
So I wouldn’t be too quick to think the worst of them.
It’s pretty obvious all these “artifacts” are optical illusions.
The “city” looked like a bunch of rocks to me.
The “pyramid” didn’t look perfect.
Also,there’s plenty of rocks on Mars.
There’s bound to be a few weird looking ones.
It covers the second face at Cydonia along with two distinct dolphin-shaped features.
If alien civilizations exist  I’m neutral towards the exo-planet “another earth” hype in the press , then they had histories.
Some may have died out and others gone past the stage of monumental buildings, but alien archeology exists.
Whether it exists in the solar system remains to be found.
There is a great fringe industry that demands ancient astronauts as the doers of everything our ancestors did, but that’s mishegoss.
It also should not present any real evidence from being examined.
If Mars was once inhabitable and warm with hydrogen as the greenhouse gas, then for how long?
If Venus once had oceans and an earth like surface temperature, then for how long?
How long does it take for evolution to bring forth an intelligent species?
What if evolution is only partially correct and intelligence is selected for by a strong anthropic universe?
I don’t argue this to imply UFO aliens, it’s likely that any intelligence died out both on Mars and on Venus because Mars could not keep it’s atmosphere and Venus experienced a hellish global warming due to the sun’s increasing energy output.
It’s not likely that either planet evolved an intelligent species capable of space flight because we don’t see clear remnants of their space program.
Either would be interested in earth as the last habitable planet from their perspective.
But when we get beyond this solar system, we will either find other star systems barren of advanced life or we will find life to be very common, with cultures at all stages, so exo-archeology will someday become a true science and not part of a conspiracy theory aimed at NASA for allegedly suppressing evidence.
Sources of dubious  and not-so-dubious  news on the internet have been getting very excited for the past week or so about some skulls from Paracas in south-western Perú.
According to these sites, the skulls have been shown to have DNA that proves them not to be modern Homo sapiens but something else.

Wait, what?
Looks like you came here from Geekosystem.
Don t worry, everything is still here.
We ve just combined forces with The Mary Sue to bring you more and better content, all in one place.
You got served, NASA!
The Case of The Jelly Doughnut-Rock On Mars has yet to be cracked, and in an extreme development yesterday, one alien enthusiast is even suing NASA for failing to pursue the extraterrestrial origins of Pinnacle Island.
Thanks to the e-mails that we’ve also been getting from the Plaintiff, we can tell you exactly why he’s pursuing legal action.
Joseph believes that the “rock” NASA says may have been overturned by the rover’s loose wheel is, in fact, a biological organism, and that had NASA just taken the time to look a little closer, they could have figured that out, too.
The lawsuit also explains that even in the rover’s lamentably poor-quality pictures, Joseph was easily able to see “tentacle-like growths typical of Apothecium” on Pinnacle Island.
NASA is insisting on calling this structure a “rock” and have attributed to this structure a chemical and mineral composition which is unlike anything believed to be associated with the Martian surface.
How NASA determined the structure’s composition has not been explained.
Note the miniature “bowl shaped” growth in the exact same location where the larger bowl-shaped structure appears 12 Martian days later.
Clearly, obviously, the “mystery” structure reported by the Mars Rover team was already there in miniature  3528  before the larger structure was photographed 12 Martian days later  3540 .
It was growing.
Its not a magical “rock” or a “meteor” which suddenly appeared out of thin air as NASA claims.
Rocks and meteors do not grow in size; and they would leave a debris field or evidence of impact–and there is none.
Yup, seems pretty conclusive.
Essentially Joseph is frustrated that it was up to him to do the real scientific work of enlarging a picture, looking at it, and forming opinions.
A legitimate scientist would have taken hundreds of close-up pictures from every angle.
There are NO close up pictures.
WHY?
Yet NO microscopic investigation was taken and no microscopic pictures released.
Why?
In the e-mail he sent us, he even gave us the contact information for our man Space Detective Steve Squyres, so that we too can condemn the NASA Investigator for just, you know, letting the ball drop and forgetting to pursue that whole alien thing.
Okay, alien enthusiasts, you win.
Obviously NASA is full of slackers who can’t be bothered to do their jobs.
I’m going to go do some “scientific research” of my own and look at past images taken by rovers until I finally see that colony of unicorns I always expected was on Mars.
Then I’m going to sue Joseph for not finding them for me earlier.
ALMOST everywhere you go on Earth, you encounter alien species that were introduced – often inadvertently – by humans.
Now it seems possible that we have done the same to Mars.
Despite stringent rules designed to prevent contamination, Earth microbes may have reached the Red Planet.
That might look like a blow for efforts to detect Martian life.
But, ironically, it may end up being the opposite.
The strict rules actually hamper the search for life by adding unnecessary costs to missions, they say.
Is there a case for relaxing the rules?
Perhaps.
If Mars has its own life, it should be different enough from Earth life for us to recognise it.
If it doesn t, any bugs we find will be recognisably terrestrial.
In either case, Earth life will struggle to colonise Mars.
Recent arrivals are unlikely to thrive in the harsh conditions, and the possibility of them outcompeting any natives is about as likely as parrots colonising Antarctica and ousting the penguins.
However, many life-detecting experiments rely on picking up whiffs of gas or traces of chemicals rather than finding life itself.
Any relaxation of the laws must rule out the chances of earthly contamination leading to infuriating false positives.
There s another factor too.
While governments of most spacefaring nations have agreed to abide by the rules, the law is unclear on private companies such as SpaceX and Mars One, who are hoping to beat national agencies to Mars.
Mars One has declared that it will play by the rules if it ever succeeds in starting the first human colony on Mars.
But others may not follow suit.
Elsewhere in the solar system, though, sterilisation rules remain vital – especially for icy moons such as Jupiter s Europa and Saturn s Titan, which are the best hopes for finding an independent origin of life.
If a spacecraft crashed or melted through Europa s shell into the ocean beneath, it could have fatal consequences for everything living there.
The only thing worse than not finding life – if it is there – would be finding it after we ve destroyed it.
Every day, many different targeted attacks occur using various social engineering themes.
Social engineering is a critical first stage of a spear-phishing email attack, as it lays the ground work to the eventual compromise of a victim s computer.
The social engineering theme is usually related to the victim’s business or current news, but occasionally, unusual social engineering themes show up.
Despite their strange nature, these peculiar social engineering themes may be enough to arouse your curiosity.
This basic human emotion is difficult to ‘control’ – “Curiosity is the lust of the mind,” as the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes once said.

To add credibility to the email, the attackers impersonated the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA , and signed it as a known astronaut who works for the organization.

What if the first of Earth’s interplanetary settlers was not human?
Of course our first explorers will be bipedal oxygen-loving Earth mammals, but the word settlement implies a long-term stay.
If we send, say, 20 humans to set up a colony on Mars , we’ll have to either ship literally tons of food along with them or come up with some incredibly efficient on-ship farms and gardens.
There is another option however, one that is often dismissed as impossible despite a near total lack of hard data on the subject: perhaps we could terraform Mars itself.
Growing crops in the Martian soil could make food, drink, and even oxygen a non-issue for any human settlements that came after.
A pioneering researcher named Michael Mautner wants to assess just how feasible that idea really is, by trying to grow everything from yeast to potatoes in simulated alien soil.
Mautner is an “astro-ecologist,” an expert in alien biospheres, but since we haven’t actually found any alien biospheres just yet, Mautner and his very few international colleagues have historically worked only in predictions and inferences.
Those years of thinking have led Mautner to address one of the biggest problems with growing plants on Mars: Martian soil lacks virtually everything a plant would need to grow.
Algae growing in meteorite soil.
The proposed solution to this problem is to use an asteroid as our source of nutrients, since they often contain nutrients, organic carbon, and even water.
Mautner ground up meteorite samples into something like soil, and is now compiling a database of growth rates for different species in different situations.
All his alien farming is of course done on Earth with our oxygen-rich atmosphere and 62% higher force of gravity, so the results are anything but definitive, but “anaerobic”  oxygen-free  growth is not as unheard-of as you might think.
Getting regular, aerobic plants and microorganisms to grow is just the first step — future Martian settlers may very well end up eating virtually nothing but man-made species genetically tailored to survive on Mars.
When colonizing space, we could end up moving an asteroid into orbit around Earth, the Moon, or Mars for use as a satellite farm.
This could then seed the planet below through soil samples or even a violent, intentional impact with the planet’s surface.
Alternatively, we might exploit a natural impact on Mars, moving in to take advantage of the newly deposited nutrients before time steals them away.
It’s possible we could build a cliche “biodome” over these areas to let life create a stable atmosphere, but just as possible we could use species tailored to the natural environment of Mars.
Oxygenating the whole planetary atmosphere might be possible in the long term, but we could never do it quickly enough to precede human colonies.
This experiment at Utah’s Mars Desert Research Station looks at the effects of temperature and atmosphere on plant growth.
A well thought-out terraforming strategy would thus work in stages, first establishing a foothold with any species that will naturally clear the way for a more specialized second organism.
Almost certainly, the process would begin with microorganisms like cyanobacteria which could live simple lives and enrich any soil they inhabit.
Perhaps two or three species down that line we might begin to incorporate some recognizable food crop — maybe the peanut.
Mautner has managed to successfully grow both asparagus and potato samples in his alien soil simulate, and the microbes have done even better.
Prior work from NASA and others has confirmed that all manner of plants can grow  reasonably  well in low or zero gravity environments, so that shouldn’t be too large a problem.
The next major round of experiments should at least begin to incorporate pressure chambers to simulate different atmospheric conditions, though.
Could NASA’s next life-finding Martian rover actually bring some life of its own?
We can imagine small, orderly plots of would-be bacterial invaders laid down by a robot and checked periodically for growth.
Alternatively, perhaps the agency could outfit the rover with a tiny biodome of its own to provide a stable atmosphere over a sample of collected Martian soil.
This would also reduce the risk of our contaminating Mars with potentially destabilizing Earth microbes.
These crops were grown on the ISS, and testing proved they were safe to eat.
Astro-ecology provides an almost unlimited possibility space to explore, so Mautner isn’t satisfied just thinking about colonizing Mars.
His other area of interest is interstellar colonies, in which we basically send out little bio-grenades to seed life all over the galaxy.
Called “directed panspermia” this would be an extreme application of the basic research on display here, and a very long way out.
Sending life to other planets, however, might happen a good deal sooner than you think.
Percival Lowell’s sketches of supposed canals on Mars.
Or, at left, a giant daddy longlegs that got a bit tangled up in itself; at right, a guitar whose strings have exploded from someone shredding too hard.
In fact, it’s cold as hell.
Wrong, American astronomer Percival Lowell would have said if he hadn’t … I guess … died 100 years ago.
Also, what do you mean there’s no one there to raise them?
What about you, dummy?
It s OK to be wrong, even fantastically so.
Because when it comes to understanding our world, mistakes mean progress.
From folklore to pure science, these are history’s most bizarre theories.
Our man Lowell, you see, was quite convinced that an alien race occupied Mars , though he never directly commented on their potential as babysitters for human astronauts.
And he even had the evidence to prove they existed: an immense network of canals carved into the Martian surface that he spied through a telescope.
This saga begins in 1888, when Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli announced that he had observed what he called canali on Mars, drawing the sketch below.
You might be thinking that Martians would seem to struggle with the whole digging in a straight line thing, but to Schiaparelli, these were purely natural features of the landscape.
That’s because canali is Italian for channels, not canals.
Giovanni Schiaparelli’s sketch of canali on Mars.
Notice Elysium at top right.
Schiaparelli’s idea of paradise was apparently misery on an inhospitable planet.
That’s not how it was translated into English , though.
So, along comes Lowell, who takes the idea of “canals” on Mars and gets … a bit carried away with it.
The incredibly gorgeous, decidedly canal-free surface of Mars.
At left is a smiling crater: Astronomers believe Mars to be among the happiest of planets.
An aside: This is a common trope still bandied around about evolution, that there are milestones creatures reach, like us humans with our brains.
In reality, critters can develop incredibly complex features such as, say, eyes, then go and lose them in a pitch-black ecosystem like a cave .
Anyway, the cooperation the aliens achieved in their task, he marvels, puts our own belligerence as a species, our “boyish and unthinking element of the nation,” to shame.
Today we have the hindsight of knowing that what Schiaparelli and Lowell observed was simply an optical illusion.
Telescopes had only been invented at the turn of the 17th century, and were nowhere near as sophisticated as the monstrously powerful devices that can today peer billions of light years out into the universe.
Ever get so carried away with an idea that you spend a fortune building an observatory to prove it?
I see you back there, Percival Lowell.
Come on, raise that hand.
Subsequent mapping of the surface of Mars of course found no such canals, and thankfully none of NASA’s rovers have yet tumbled into the greatest public works project the solar system has  n ever known.
We now know, though, that water likely flowed freely on Mars long ago, but today is almost exclusively locked in the polar caps, with liquid water perhaps flowing from time to time .
Lowell was wrong, sure, really wrong, but his study of the Martian surface and the consequent debate most certainly advanced our understanding of the Red Planet.
And his observatory?
In 1930, Clyde William Tombaugh peered through its telescope and discovered the planet Pluto , whose existence Lowell himself had predicted.
So yeah, alright, they were maybe wrong about it being a planet.
It’s really a dwarf planet and  Kuiper-belt object .
But we only decided that a few years ago  after much debate among astronomers — some folks in fact vehemently demand it immediately regain its erstwhile title, particularly these third-graders  .
It’s all just semantics, really.
Like the difference between channel and canal, for instance.
The first image, Sol 3528, was taken 12 days ago.
The new image, Sol 3540, features a rock that was not there previously and Opportunity had not driven over the area.
Joseph filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, reports Popular Science .
Joseph, working as an astrobiologist, claims NASA has failed to investigate evidence of life on Mars.
The abstract reads, “What appears to be spore-producing  paraphyses  can be observed on the structure, as is apparent upon magnification and which is typical of Apothecia.
Joseph refutes NASA’s claims that the object is either a rock or piece of debris from a nearby impact.
The Mars rover first photographed the outcrop on Sol 3528 and again 12 days later, Sol 3540.
During their initial analysis of the rock, the “jelly” part has a high concentration of magnesium, sulfur and manganese than other Martian rocks.
For now, the team has yet to reach a definitive conclusion as to how the rock got there, they believe it may have been knocked over by Opportunity’s wheel as it was making a turn, but do they determine it is a rock and not a sign of Martian life.
Joseph says he discovered the evidence of a Martian organism after magnifying the images.
After comparing structural examples of apothecia, or “shield lichen,” with what was found on Mars, including the “paraphyses,” the “spore producing organs, he concludes the organism grew over the twelve days that Opportunity photographed the rock outcrop.
Joseph.
Despite this evidence, NASA has yet to acknowledge the Mars mystery rock is in fact evidence of life.
Joseph’s lawsuit laws out his claims as well as detailing the ways he tried to contact NASA officials to research the rock.
Joseph is not seeking damages but wants NASA to “take 100 high resolution close-up in-focus photos of the specimen identiﬁed in Sol 3540, at various angles, from all sides, and from above down into the  bowl  of the specimen, and under appropriate lighting conditions which minimize glare.
Take a minimum of 24 microscopic in-focus images of the exterior, lip, walls, and interior of the specimen under appropriate lighting conditions.
As io9 points out, Joseph does not have the best reputation within the scientific community.
The Journal of Cosmology tends to have some dubious articles and would not be considered as reputable as journals such as Nature or Science.
We have been lead to believe that our efforts into space have  advanced along purely typical lines of scientific investigation of natural  phenomena such as Mankind has always done on Earth.
That quest has naturally  moved outward to other worlds in our solar system and beyond as technology has  allowed.
Such is true in the greater sense of what Science is about.
But the  driving force of off-planet investigations has at its core a hidden agenda  beyond that of our innate curiosity.
The directed goal has been a search for  answers to a troubling predicament: Where do the UFO s come from, and are they  local to our solar system?
We are in the midst of a slow, scientific  disclosure that started with our early space probes and is increasing in  velocity at an ever-increasing rate.
Under our watchful and frequently  enthralled eyes we have been presented with a growing escalation of new  discoveries every few weeks.
The public knows these revelations as Martian  meteorites with fossilized primitive life forms, water on Mars, and the Moon,  Titian maybe harboring life in its oceans, Mars anomalies, and, recently,  planets found around other stars.
Without a doubt, the discovery of earth-like planets will be found any day now.
Closer to home and in recent weeks, there has  been a recent renewing of the argument over the results from the Viking “search  for life” experiments in the late 1970s.
Unbeknown to the public, that  all-important question has never been fully or correctly answered.
What has never been discussed to any firm conclusion or even  headed in the right direction is an important key that could have answered the  question of life on Mars early on in our investigations of the planet.
That  finding was not about primitive life forms, but evidence of intelligent actions.
But that surprise discovery was successfully kept hidden in plain sight with a  very low level of interest shown in the data.
Being the giver of all data in the early years of space  exploration, NASA has kept the lid on the secret, but times have changed.
NASA   the US government  no longer has total control.
It has partners and competitors  with which to work and contend.
The single-handed, iron-fisted control of data  by NASA  and Malin  is gone.
Politics and ideologies enter the picture of what  we find out there and how to interpret and report it.
Strangely enough or not,  even our non-NASA, pro-ETs and pro-UFOs organizations, prominent writers in the  field, and self-promoting showmen have not responded to the key data that  resides in the public domain, dormant, virtually hidden from easy access.
Perhaps it would be more correct to say there exists in some of these areas a “hands-off” policy coupled with overt attempts to focus attention elsewhere  because this knowledge does explicitly explain straight away by implication the  UFO phenomena.
First, we need to understand the evolution of the situation from  the beginning to where it is now, crowded with more participants.
Briefly, as  the 1960s’ development of ICBMs grew to monstrous proportions, they were soon  topped with smaller rockets to give an extended reach to orbital flight and  eventually to missions to the planets.
The simple charts we see of the numerous  planetary launches, both successes and failures, by the Soviets and the US belie  the course of events and the jockeying of the super-powers.
Critical decisions  were made.
The Soviets chose Venus to explore as being the home of the ETs, and  NASA aimed for Mars.
Both nations dabbled somewhat in the territory of the  other, but to no great success.
It didn’t take much probing from the Soviets to  prove Venus inhospitable.
Strangely or not, their attempts to study Mars were  almost totally disastrous.
The NASA JPL scientists joked that a Martian monster  reached out and thwarted in some fashion about every Soviet effort thrown toward  that planet.
The Soviets had over thirty failed shots to Mars, one after  another.
Whatever the real reason, the Soviets were shut out on Mars despite  their successes to Venus.
On the other hand, almost all of NASA’s missions to  Mars were successes.
Mars,  via the progressive discoveries of Mariners 6, 7 and finally, 9 in 1971, turned  out to be the likely source for ETs in this solar system.
True, it was indeed an  alien environment as compared to Earth, but it was considered to be the last  possible planet in the solar system that had even a minute chance of supporting   or having supported  some aspect of life.
At Carl Sagan’s urging, who sincerely believed life existed on  Mars, mysterious Phobos was added to the Mariner 9 flight program.
About 70  images of Phobos were returned.
The quality of the images was not sterling, but  enough data was recovered to show unsettling anomalies that piqued interest.
In  addition, the moon was not ball-shaped like a moon is usually considered, but it  was similar to a chunk of rock, possibly a captured asteroid.
From then on  Phobos, itself, was high on the agenda for data acquisition in future Mars’ explorations although Mars itself remained the prime focus.
The Viking program began in 1968 and development started in 1969.
The twin Viking probes were launched in 1975.
The Viking Orbiters’ cameras were  tasked with providing answers about both the surfaces of the planet and the twin  moons of Phobos and Deimos.
Yet the primary focus of the Viking twin missions  was the “search for life” experiments done by scooping into the Martian soil.
The biological experiments were where the attention was automatically focused,  and perhaps eventually used to down-play the mysterious images of Phobos that  showed signs of intelligent manipulation.
What the Orbiters revealed about Phobos can stand as the primary  reason NASA and JPL later gave up the prompt release of spacecraft images,  especially from the Mars’ probes and assigned the rights to a non-governmental  business, Malin and company.
In this way they bought time to study all images carefully,  circumvented the quick release of images as had been in the past practice, and  escaped pesky FOIA requests from the public.
But the damage was done before  those actions were taken.
The only recourse was to not give too much image  attention to Phobos despite the public being somewhat aware of its curious  attributes.
After all, it was nothing more than a little, cratered body,  resembling a “diseased potato” as someone in JPL, perhaps purposely and  picturesquely described it.
And who would or could question the experts?
Regardless, the Viking Orbiters and subsequent spacecraft have  provided us with the proof we need.
The Orbiters were the first to give  indications that Phobos had a problem with it dimensions not matching its  assumed mass.
Their instruments determined that Phobos evidently contained voids  of either empty space or a far larger area filled with a less “heavy” substance,  such as water.
The second problem with Phobos was the mysterious markings that  ran over much of its surface.
A few attempts have been made to explain both  features, but none have been satisfactory to explain the actual data.
That lack  of a final determination is because there is no acceptable explanation for the  markings, at least, not in the natural way NASA would have it.
Efforts to  construction suitable explanations were, in a word, strained.
It is incomprehensible that some scientist at the heart of the  Viking program—Sagan in particular—did not put the basic facts together and  understand how Mars, via the data of Phobos, even if with no other indicators  from the planet itself, was the home for the UFO ETs.
An honest, unbiased appraisal of the Martian moon Phobos shows it  to be the work of intelligent action.
If Phobos did not circle Mars in its  present orbit as proof that it is there, many astrophysicists would not even  accept that possibility!
Some have flatly said that it is impossible for it to  have been a captured asteroid, that natural physics simply could not be  contrived to the degree necessary for the capture to happen.
Yet, those  astrophysicists and exogeologists that claim Phobos was created in or near its  current position from leftover debris from the formation of Mars, have a  dilemma.
While sidestepping the “capture” theory entirely, they cannot offer a  viable argument why the two little satellites’ compositions and structures are  far different than Mars.
In fact, the two moons have the characteristics of  D-class asteroids found on the outer edges of the asteroid belt, as far away as  possible, out near Jupiter.
The simple truth is that Phobos was brought in to be  placed in it tight, near-perfect orbit as was its twin, Deimos.
In sum, we have  not just one incredible occurrence, but two.
A leading disinformation agent was pretending a few months ago as  if the discrepancy between the dimensions of Phobos and its mass was a recent  discovery from the ESA mission to Mars earlier this year.
Nothing could be  further from the truth.
The Viking probes of the late 1970s, reported such  discrepancies as mentioned here earlier.
That discovery over three decades ago  presented a curious problem to the scientists, but NASA showed no great desire  to fully explain it or to fully investigate it with subsequent probes to the  area  as far as the public is aware .
That informational void made way for  several independent scientists to spout some outlandish explanations outside of  the peer pressure of the NASA community.
But none went so far as to suggest ET  activities, or if they did, NASA didn’t publish those papers along with the  others.
But this recently ballyhooed void situation is being allowed to become a  topic of speculation in the public domain, and the question of intelligent  activity on the little moon comes into play with collaborating evidence  concerning the many surface markings.
As  for the markings, nothing similar had been seen before, or since in the solar  system.
To this day as with the voids, no solid explanation has been offered by  NASA.
Strangely, we seem to know more about the depths of Titan’s oceans than  about the quite visible grooves of Phobos.
Stranger still, we frequently read  and hear from NASA folks gushing about the possibilities of primitive life  within those oceans.
Missing are scientists commenting about higher life forms  having possibly interacted with Phobos.
We might ponder why NASA has settled on the term of “grooves” for  the markings when other more formal geological, descriptive terms would apply if  they were natural formations.
The answer is because the markings are precisely  that, “grooves” cut into the surface by unknown objects.
At some point NASA  realized what caused them, and the markings were correctly and not innocently  labeled grooves.
In this seemingly innocent naming, NASA will never have to go  back and reclassify them once they are recognized for what they are.
That  descriptive nomenclature will always correctly apply.
The Vikings recorded dozens of excellent images of the grooves.
Some are very striking close-ups.
One was taken from only 80 km away and shows a  field of grooves resembling a plowed field.
For decades now, its carefully  cropped image, it has been the defining one presented to the public across the  whole of the media.
But the image shows only a small area of curious terrain.
What is revealed on the Viking CD set from NASA is an entirely  different understanding of the grooves.
Within the set, whole fields of striking  grooves are apparent, hundreds, across varying angles covering major parts of  the surface.
Most grooves are oriented along the length of the body.
Some fields  meet other fields at various angles.
Some overrun others.
Some appear fresher  that more weathered others.
Some are deeper, wider and longer.
The recent ESA  images of Phobos give excellent examples of the grooves, and while their  resolution is better than the three-decades old Viking images, they are no  better in showing the truth of what has been denied us all of these years.
It has been claimed that intelligent actions on Phobos, strip  mining, for example, is an explanation for the grooves.
That would appear to  make sense in view of how strip mining is done on Earth: Phobos and Deimos were  brought to Mars for mining from the outer reaches of the asteroid belt where  their D-type cluster, normally resides.
And even if moved to Mars for an  entirely different purpose, such as an artistic, technological whim, it still  may have contained exotic resources worth mining.
Some of the  incredible images returned from the Viking Orbiters give an exceptional  perspective on the longer, more independent family of grooves.
One vivid groove  in particular provided the insight to suggest the answer to the entire mystery.
Frankly, not much insight or intelligence was necessary.
All that is required is  for the conscious mind to acknowledge what the eyes reported regardless of what  explanations have been planted by others.
The key image  bringing this realization is frame no.
F244A08 on volume 1014 of the Viking  series of CDs from NASA.
The image is a high-resolution picture of the  underbelly of Phobos which highlights the most prominent groove.
A spectacularly  beautiful and vivid image of Phobos, it is a classic, full-bodied image.
It is  the most commonly found full-length image in publications and on the internet.
It has not been bettered with subsequent images of that type from later probes.
To the contrary, it has been replaced by those depicting less telling features.
I studied the  picture for several minutes the first time I came across it on the Viking CD  set.
I had seen the image many times before, but never as sharp and clear as  what filled the computer screen.
There was a nagging familiarity to the image of  this yet strange scene of this distance, little body.
I realized with a  start that I was seeing a similarity to something more earthly.
The picture  looked exactly as if a large boulder had slid down the side of a mountain slope.
The similarity was remarkable.
Except in this case, the line of travel appeared  horizontally along the length of Phobos rather than vertically, down a slope.
Otherwise, the scene had no relationship to a mountain.
In fact, on little  Phobos, there would be no up or down, only minuscule gravity and certainly  nothing to pull anything “down” the length of Phobos.
How could that same effect happen along the length on  Phobos if it had so little differential in its physical environment?
How could  that condition possibly present itself under those circumstances?
What were those assumed  circumstances?
What was its physical environment if not now, but at some earlier point in time?
I mulled  the situation over for a couple of days and finally the answer came to solve the entire riddle of Phobos, to justify UFOs and to recognize that we have ancient  neighbors.
The creation of  the grooves is best conveyed by understanding them as formed by large blocks of  solid material having moved, slid, down the side of “Mount” Phobos.
But we need  to completely change that dynamic image to match the real events that made it  so.
Imagine in your  mind’s eye a picture of a boulder slipping and rolling down a mountainside  leaving a….
Stop!
Let’s reverse the dynamics.
Instead, envision the mountain  moving and the large boulder remaining relatively stationary!
The result is the  same.
Find that not easy to adapt to Phobos?
Then think of it in the  following way.
Switch the mind’s  eye to see a more earthly, silly scenario of what we can call a Phobos brand  pickup truck setting at a stoplight with a layer of fine sand in the truck bed  and a large rock setting atop that layer.
The truck is  motionless.
The light changes to green, and the driver accelerates away,  unfortunately, too fast.
The truck moves as one unit, of course, the sand pretty  much moves along with the truck with some grains dribbling out the back.
But the  large rock has stronger and different geometric and physical forces acting on  it.
It tends to want to stay where it was, stationary.
As the truck starts  accelerating, the rock does start to move too, but not at the same rate as the  truck.
The rock uses its inherent stationary mass and the lubrication qualities  of the sand to resist motion.
It appears to slide down the length of the truck  bed when in reality, the truck is moving out from under it.
If the tailgate is  down, the rock relocates itself to the ground, bounces and rolls a bit before  becoming truly stationary while the truck zooms away.
We carry this  mechanism of an accelerating body and its shifting load to the real world of  Phobos.
At some point in its history the body of Phobos was accelerated at a  rate sufficient for loose boulders and rocks on its surface to slide in the  regolith  loose surface material  down its length and some of them, due to the  low gravity, continued to move off into space.
The acceptance of the activities which  caused the markings on Phobos requires a clear but simple understanding of the  forces of gravity and mass as they exist on that little body.
There is hardly  any relationship between how those forces operate on Earth versus on Phobos,  even though the natural forces are the same.
Actually, gravity is almost  non-existent on Phobos.
A 250 lb human on Earth would weight less than four  ounces on Phobos.
That is less than 1 1000th of Earth’s gravity.
The  escape velocity there is not more than a meager 30 miles per hour and half that  at some points on the unevenly shaped body.
Compare that with the 7 miles per second required for the  escape velocity of anything from the surface of the Earth.
On Phobos, you can  throw a baseball into orbit.
The  regolith on Phobos does not resemble earthly dirt.
It is an ultra-fine dust.
Apollo astronauts found that Moon dust, a universal dust, was a stubborn problem  because it was extremely fine textured, similar to cement powder and crept into  everything.
One astronaut called it  greasy.  On Phobos with miniscule gravity,  it goes without saying that its regolith material would have a less dense  consistency and more of a lubrication quality far beyond loose sand and dirt we  are familiar with here.
Combine the deep, loose regolith on Phobos with a house-sized  boulder set within it, give the moon a quick shove and the boulder because of  the resistance of its mass to motion becomes virtually a standing still  bulldozer as everything else moves.
In the almost none-existent field of gravity  on Phobos, the results tend to mimic our truck and rock scenario, and grooves  are formed.
In the layer of regolith in the truck, the groove left from the  stone would be fairly uniform, straight out the back.
On the surface of Phobos,  the grooves would be somewhat curved and uneven in depth and width due  inconsistencies of the surface upon which the house-sized objects moved as they  used their mass to push their way to escape through the regolith.
There are few  if any remnants of these discrete rock bodies visible on Phobos because they  have been sloughed off the surface when Phobos was repeatedly hit with velocity  increases and decreases.
Those that remain are more deeply anchored or otherwise  hindered from moving.
Graphically put, the stopping thrust must equal the starting  thrust.
Viking images plainly show both ends of the moon lost material off their  ends.
This illustrates two major opposite velocity changes were introduced upon  the body probably via repeated accelerations and decelerations of velocity and  positioning maneuvers.
We Earthlings must use a one-engine style of space propulsion  because every ounce of that machine has to be lifted through the Earth’s gravity  at a tremendous cost of propellant.
The luxury of our having the option of two  main systems is unthinkable due to such constraints.
But we make do.
We simply  employ maneuvering thrusters to turn the craft around 180 degrees for  retro-fire.
With a large object like Phobos, turning it 180 degrees for  retrofire of a one-engine system would not be a simple task.
Structural  integrity, stability and maintaining course would become major concerns when  applying a lateral force to a speeding mass that size.
Unlike a manufactured  spacecraft, its strengths and weaknesses could not be known with finite measure.
And that method of maneuvering would require robust long-duration side-thrusters   or angled main thrusters  to get the body turned for retrofire.
Any turning of  the body would be done slowly during the bulk of the transition.
Some of the  other field of grooves perpendicular to the longitudinal line of thrust for the  main “engines” are suggestive that it did undergo some side thrusting, perhaps  at the critical time of insertion into the Mars’ orbit.
The tell-tale grooves readily seen in the images running off both  ends of Phobos are silent indications that the surface material fell off via the  use of primary thrusters on both ends.
First from one end during the Jupiter  orbit-busting phrase, and then at the Crater Stickney end, during the  deceleration directional changes required to slow the body and place it into the  tight orbit.
We know the maximum amount of velocity change required to shake  the debris free from Phobos in one instant.
That would be the escape velocity  required for the little moon, which is about 30 miles per hour maximum.
If the  Martians had some super-colossal propulsion source capable attaining 30 mph very  quickly for that large mass, then the debris would have been thrown off just as  swiftly.
That possibility seems unlikely, and the evidence shows  otherwise.
If that was the case, we wouldn’t see the visible evidence of the  long grooves, instead we would see only short ones where the boulders were  jolted from deep pockets where they had lain for millions of years and in the  next few seconds bounded off the surface.
With the long grooves, however, we can  determine that Phobos was not moved by any fast, magical means.
And in fact, at  a rate of acceleration deceleration considerably under the 30 mph escape  velocity.
Rather, the debris moved along the surface in a comparatively gentle  series of jostles until lost off the receding end.
A section in my main work from which this is taken discusses  Project Orion.
This was an unbelievable late 1950s hydrogen bomb-powered rocket  concept.
As crazy as it sounds, the concept lived as an actual project for  several years within which the famous Freeman Dyson was a devoted participant.
It involved firing H-bombs at about half-second intervals to act against a  concave blast-reaction shield plate to lift a gigantic, 4000-ton space ship from  Earth.
This concept applied to Phobos can be visualized as craters being the  reaction plates.
The crater Stickney and its interior smaller member is a  perfect example of what we could expect to see on Phobos.
Of course, this  concept may not relate to the method the Martians actually used, but the  adoption of the Orion process and evidence of what can be called “blast craters” gives an understandable means of locomotion within our limited human reasoning  and envisioning powers.
There is an intriguing, possible link between the long-gone  Project Orion, asteroids, and Phobos.
In the last chapter of the book by that  name authored by George Dyson, the son, he innocently sums up the Orion affair  as he quotes his father as telling him in 1999: “NASA officials have booked a  conference room at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for Monday  morning next week and are flying up from Huntsville with twelve scientists who  want to talk about Orion.
After the meeting,  NASA requested to buy 1759 pages of old Orion documents that the young Dyson,  had collected in his research efforts for writing the book.
Some months later he  received a draft report entitled  External Pulsed Plasma Propulsion and Its  Potential for the New Future.  The report said in part.
EPPP provides a  technology that would allow us to seriously consider missions to the outer  planets.
It would also enable dramatically shorter trips times to Mars and other  nearer-term destinations.
The other and perhaps most compelling application for  EPPP is its use in asteroid or comet defense.
There is a low, but not negligible  probability of a collision with objects of sufficient size to cause catastrophic  damage or an extinction-scale event.
This passage in the report reveals that they see the potentiality  for redirecting asteroids away from close encounters with the Earth Moon system  via Orion-type methods and as they first mentioned, as actual vehicles for  interplanetary space flight.
Could that professed interest, while soundly  legitimate, can also be a cover for a slightly different reason for the interest  NASA had in the Orion?
Having recognized that Phobos was moved, they would have  a strong interest in how that monumental mission was accomplished.
The proposed firing frequency for the Project Orion rocket to  achieve escape velocity from Earth at half-second intervals was to prevent it  from falling back.
The firing rate of a possible Phobos primitive bomb engine  would not be a factor.
5 AU from Mars.
A leisurely few jolts, perhaps  infrequent, would suffice when the asteroid was in the proper position for the  transition.
The fall to the Mars’ area of rotation would be gravitationally  assisted by the Sun’s influence, a free tug by gravity toward the target, but  too much so.
The additional velocity of falling inward would require a prolonged  over-cancelling  slowing  of those increases during much of the inward journey.
The entire process from orbiting near Jupiter to orbiting Mars  may have consumed about a year.
To be sure, there would have been a precise  coordination to the efforts of position and velocity during the journey, but few  places in the transition would be as demanding as when the 16x13x11-mile body  was brought into the vicinity of Mars’ gravity.
The Phobos-to-be asteroid probably was set in motion before the  onboard habitat construction was started.
This plan would have allowed for  stronger, jarring blasts to be used with the only consideration being the  structural integrity of the body.
Concurrently, these explosions would have been  an excellent opportunity to perform dynamic tests of the body’s integrity.
If it  failed by some unforeseen flaw, it could be discarded in route and the search  started again for another candidate.
At the end of the journey, the stresses of  maneuvering the body into a Mars’ orbit would have been a further test of its  durability.
However, by doing the interior “renovation” of the asteroid  during the transition, the removed material would have been merely dumped  overboard with enough of a push to escape the body’s low gravity.
In that  fashion, they prevented any problem of disposing of the material once in close  orbit around Mars.
The Martian’s could take their time setting up each shot.
A  precise, blast-every-half-second delivery system absolutely dictated for an  Orion ship would have been totally unnecessary.
The most simplistic procedures  possible would have sufficed.
A little ship could drop down into the crater  shield, position the bomb at leisure and then back off around the crater’s edge  to fire it remotely.
The grooves present us with a full record of the motions, from  start to end, that the body went through as it was guided to Mars.
Many of the  grooves on Phobos lead directly to the tips where they end, of course, having  slipped off into space, off the tailgate of Phobos so to speak.
Such traces also  tell us that the relative escape velocity of the debris  relative to the  acceleration deceleration of the main body  was not reached by rapid, successive  firings.
If so, grooves would end at some point before reaching the end of the  body as escape velocity was reached.
They would show progressively shallower as  the debris approached their relative escape velocities and would end altogether  when that velocity was obtained and or they bounced and skimmed away from the  surface before reaching the turned-down end.
The sage of the moons of Mars could stop at this point, but it  cannot.
This is but the beginning.
There is a larger scenario to be  contemplated.
Deimos was probably the first body brought down as a test of the  Martian’s abilities.
It was placed at a relatively safe distance of three Mars’ diameters  7767 miles  away from the surface.
The far, far more incredibility  difficult but precise placement of Phobos at a distance of only 3715 miles above  the surface is excellent evidence also that Deimos was carefully placed, and we  can say that with confidence.
Deimos probably and originally was set in a synchronize orbit  that has slipped over the eons as it slowly drifts away from Mars.
We can expect that  astrophysicists can trace back the approximate date when Deimos was installed in  such an orbit based on that understanding.
Undoubtedly, that would have been a  very long time ago, perhaps before the time of humans.
The bringing of Phobos to a Mars’ orbit was a dangerous  undertaking.
Given the condition of Mars today, perhaps Phobos was hauled in to  be nothing more than an in-kind monument to a virtually dead Mars caused by an  earlier attempt that went terribly wrong, fell to Mars and destroyed their  civilization and the planetary environment.
The gigantic gash of Valles  Marineris may be evidence of that catastrophe.
Mars and UFOs: The great varieties of UFOs we witness makes it  unlikely that all are from one place.
The numbers and types of ships, and  various behaviors are indicative that a huge if uncountable number of other  visitors are coming here in addition to the few, if any, remaining Martians.
Perhaps they are old friends dropping by the old neighborhood to check out the  new people and visit with the old folk.
There you have it.
Any and all of my words here may be inaccurate  and even false by some standards.
I claim to be no expert.
However, they are  true to the best of my abilities or I would not have put them down.
I understand  this is a very complex matter that goes far beyond my words here, damning  conventional dogma in astronomy and how our governments have reacted to their  own discoveries of outside forces stronger by far than they.
But Phobos is the  key.
With these words, I believe the key is turning in the lock.
Is humanity and  their governments up to the task of opening that door and stepping out into the  Universe?
Do we have a choice?
Regular readers to this site may have read in the past our articles on Phobos, which is one of the small moons that circle around Mars.
As we have speculated before, this  moon  seems to be very odd, and has always been considered a rather mysterious object, as has its smaller twin, Deimos.
But first, lets look at the history of these moons and tell you of some strange events that have been related to them in the past.
Joseph Shklovskii noted member of the Soviet Academy of science and co-writer with Dr Carl Sagan of  Intelligent life in the universe , once calculated from the estimated density of the Martian atmosphere and the peculiar  acceleration  of Phobos, that the satellite must be hollow.
Could Phobos be a hollowed-out space station of huge proportions?
In July 1988, the Russians launched two unmanned satellite probes - Phobos 1 and Phobos 2 - in the direction of Mars, with the primary intention of investigating the planet s mysterious moon, Phobos.
Phobos 1 was unfortunately lost en route two months later, reportedly because of a radio command error.
Phobos 2 was also ultimately lost in the most intriguing circumstances, but not before it had beamed back certain images and information from the planet Mars itself.
Phobos 2 arrived safely at Mars in January 1989 and entered into an orbit around Mars as the first step at its destination towards its ultimate goal: to transfer to an orbit that would make it fly almost in tandem with the Martian moonlet called Phobos  hence the spacecrafts name  and explore the moonlet with highly sophisticated equipment that included two packages of instruments to be placed on the moonlet s surface.
All went well until Phobos 2 aligned itself with Phobos, the Martian moonlet.
Phobos 2 had failed to communicate with Earth as scheduled after completing an operation yesterday around the Martian moon Phobos.
What had caused the Phobos 2 spacecraft to be lost?
According to Boris Bolitsky, science correspondent for Radio Moscow, just before radio contact was lost with Phobos 2, several unusual images were radioed back to Earth, described by the Russian as  Quite remarkable features .
The features are either on the Martian surface or in the lower atmosphere.
The features are between 20 and 25 kilometers wide and do not resemble any known geological formation.
An unusual photo of a thin shadow across mars was shown on the Russian television segment.
Seen on the surface of Mars was a clearly defined dark shape that could indeed be described, as it was in he initial dispatch from Moscow, as a  thin elipse   this photo is a still from the Soviet television clip .
It was certainly different from the shadow of Phobos recorded eighteen years earlier by Mariner 9.
The latter cast a shadow that was a rounded ellipse and fuzzy at the edges, as would be cast by the uneven surface of the moonlet.
The  anomaly  seen in the Phobos 2 transmission was a thin ellipse with very sharp rather than rounded points  the shape is known in the diamond trade as a  marquise   and the edges, rather than being fuzzy, stood out sharply against a kind of halo on the Martian surface.
Dr.
Becklake described it as  something that is between the spacecraft and Mars, because we can see the Martian surface below it,  and stressed that the object was seen by both the optical and the infrared  heat seeking  camera.
All these reasons explain why the Soviets have not suggested that the dark,  thin ellipse  might have been a shadow of the moonlet.
While the image was held on the screen, Dr.
Becklake explained that it was taken as the spacecraft was aligning itself with Phobos  the moonlet .
So what was it that collided or crashed into Phobos 2?
Was the space probe shot out of space for  seeing too much ?
What does the last secret frame show?
Cosmic Conspiracies have managed to track down this ellusive last picture  see below .
This  highly secret  photo was later given to the Western press by Colonel Dr.
Marina Popovich, a Russian astronaut and pilot who has long been interested in UFO s.
At a UFO conference in 1991, Popovich gave to certain investigators some interesting information that she  smuggled  out of the now ex-Soviet Union.
Part of the information was what has been called  the first ever leaked accounts of an alien mother ship in the solar system .
5km diameter cigar-shaped  mother ship , that was photographed on 25 March 1989 hanging or parked next to the Martian moon Phobos by the Soviet unmanned probe Phobos 2.
After that last frame was radio-transmitted back to Earth, the probe mysteriously disappeared; according to the Russians it was destroyed - possibly knocked out with an energy pulse beam.
The cigar shaped craft in the penultimate frame taken by Phobos 2 is apparently the object casting the oblong shadow on the surface of Mars in the earlier photo.
Australian science writer Brian Crowley says that because of the convex cats eye shadow - which, because the overhead solar inclination prevented shadow - casting by Martian surface features, implies a shadow thrown on the surface from something in orbit - beyond the orbit of Phobos 2 itself.
Have Phobos and Diemos Disappeared?
Cosmic Conspiracies were shocked to receive news that the Moons of Mars, Phobos and Diemos, have disappeared and that any pictures that are released by NASA of Phobos are years out of date.
Below we have compiled the latest information available about this event that has been commented on by several top space scientists and astronomers.
Due to the changing geometry of the MGS orbit relative to that of Phobos, the shadow is actually seen in MOC global map images about a dozen times a month.
That being the case, would it really be so much trouble to show some Phobos shadows after June 4, 2000?
With all the assets presently at its command, NASA could resolve the issue of Phobos in a heartbeat with a current shadow image without having to change any of its mission plans.
Yet, it hides in the shadows.
If future events prove this to be so, then they’ve betrayed American taxpayers who have generously funded their programs, and who rightfully depend on all agencies of their government to protect them from harm.
As most readers will be aware, YOWUSA has been trying to solve the mystery surrounding the fate of comet 76P and its effects  if any  it had on the moons of Mars for some time now.
So far, the prevailing theory has been that 76P had either significantly disturbed the orbit of Phobos, or collided with it.
Therefore, our efforts have focused on obtaining either a good quality image of Phobos from a reliable source, or data indicating that 76P was indeed where it should have been after passing Mars.
With two avenues to pursue, one could not be blamed for thinking this was going to be easy.
However, earlier this year NASA set the scene for a trend that would continue until this day.
As to the comet itself, the Hubble Space Telescope  HST  team informally reported a 76P sighting on April 12, 2001 to Dr.
The HST team refused both requests.
It is only in recent times that several images have become known.
Two of these have already been proven beyond reasonable doubt to be untrustworthy.
At least that s what we thought.
The current super storm is now 2 months old, and it is still going strong!
However, the true severity of the storm is hard to tell because it appears to be off the charts.
The storm actually started after the last known picture of Phobos was taken, and could perhaps suggest that the actual storm could have been started by Phobos hitting the side of Mars.
But one thing is for certain; they are not particulary interested in understanding why.
Or,  they are truly interested and want to play the story down.
However, it is also possible that a large, but ordinary meteorite or several smaller ones caused the storm.
The theory favored by NASA on the other hand, blames the current super storm on Mars on planetary events, while ignoring any possiblity of an impact event.
Dr.
Tom Van Flandren, former lead astronomer at the Naval Observatory and NASA contractor, stated for the first time publicly he believes the cause of last months huge dust storm which surrounded the whole planet of Mars,  was most likely caused by an asteroid hit.  Now a group of astronomers are coming together to discuss this very real scenario.
These stars appear in the same region where the storm erupted.
The star patterns show a very cold central interior that progressively gets hotter and dustier in the outer region.
This pattern is what you could expect after an impact throws up the heated dust and rock into the atmosphere, leaving a cold interior that eventually warms again as the dust settles down.
Given that at this stage NASA still seems to be puzzled, any theory such as the one proposed by Russia and Dr.
Van Flandern is acceptable and should be up for consideration.
Malin Space Science Systems  MSSS  has secured virtually all of the Mars imaging market.
Surely Malin is not the only living image expert in the world.
Nor is he the only one with the ability to control a spacecraft, but this tiny contracting company appears to have a virtual monopoly on Mars imagery, which means that Malin s theories are always center stage.
Below is a staggering list of NASA projects that MSSS has been involved with since its inception in 1990.
Or, is he simply a competent scientist who sold out to the national security folks; who are the tail that wags NASA’s dog?
Viking has discovered another mystery in the most unexpected place - one of the two small Martian moons.
Mariner 9 s mapping of Phobos  12x14x17 miles or 20x23x28 kilometers  and Deimos  6x7x10 miles, or 10x12x16 kilometers  showed many craters, and left most investigators with the impression that they were merely rocky chunks that bore the scars of meteorite impacts.
There was a puzzling feature on Phobos that a few analysts noticed but, without better data, could say little about.
At the limit of resolution were a few small crater pits that seemed to align in one or two chains.
This was unusual, because crater chains on the moon were traditionally explained as volcanic pits - small eruption sites string along fracture lines.
Yet Phobos apparently is too small to generate heat and conventional volcanic activity.
Vikings high resolution photos have revealed that the crater chains are real and part of an extensive system of parallel grooves, a few hundred yards wide  shown in Viking orbiter photo number 39B84 .
There may be a tendency for the grooves to lie parallel to the direction of the satellites orbital motion, although there appears to be several swarms with somewhat different orientations.
Scientists are at a loss to explain them.
In the latest effort to photograph Mars and its moons, the NASA  Mars Observer  was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base in Florida in late 1992, on a 337 day voyage to Mars.
The Mars Observer initially was expected to arrive at Mars by 19 August 1993, and enter a long, elliptical orbit over the poles.
In mid November 1993 it was to begin its two year mapping of the surface of Mars.
Then suddenly, on 22nd August 1993, it was announced that NASA had lost contact with the spacecraft.
Americans and the world mourned the loss of a valuable scientific tool for understanding Mars.
Taxpayers wondered if there was a better way to spend their money than on expensive space probes that didn t work.

Another Phobos picture, released on Canadian TV, presents an infrared scan radiometer image of the Martian surface that showed clearly defined rectangular areas.
These are interconnected with a latticework of perfectly straight channels, much resembling a city block.
There were no corresponding surface features taken by regular cameras.
This suggests the heat signature of what may be a set of underground cavern or channels that are just too geometrically regular to be formed naturally.
According to Dr.
Pressed by their international participants in the Phobos missions to provide more definitive data, the Soviet authorities released the taped television transmission Phobos 2 sent in its last moments - except for the last frames, taken just seconds before the spacecraft fell silent.
The television clip was shown by some TV stations in Europe and Canada as part of weekly  diary  programs, as a curiosity and not as a hot news item.
The television sequence thus released focused on two anomalies.
The first was a network of straight lines in the area of the Martian equator; some of the lines were short, some longer, some thin, some wide enough to look like rectangular shapes  embossed  in the Martian surface.
Arranged in rows parallel to each other, the pattern covered an area of some six hundred square kilometers  more than two hundred thirty square miles .
The  anomaly  appeared to be far from a natural phenomenon.
The television clip was accompanied by a live comment by Dr.
John Becklake of England s Science Museum.
He described the phenomenon as very puzzling, because the pattern seen on the surface of Mars was photographed not with the spacecraft s optical camera but with its infrared camera - a camera that takes pictures of objects using the heat they radiate, and not by the play of light and shadow on them.
In other words, the pattern of parallel lines and rectangles covering an area of almost two hundred fifty square miles was a source of heat radiation.
It is highly unlikely that a natural source of heat radiation  a geyser or a concentration of radioactive minerals under the surface, for example  would create such a perfect geometric pattern.
When viewed over and over again, the pattern definitely looks artificial; but what it was, the scientist said,  I certainly don t know.   Cosmic Conspiracies have written to Dr.
Becklake in the hope that we can track down this picture .
Since no coordinates for the precise location of this  anomalous feature  have been released publicly, it is impossible to judge its relationship to another puzzling feature on the surface of Mars that can be seen in Mariner 9 frame 4209-75  pictured left .
4  and has been described as  unusual indentations with radial arms protruding from a central hub  caused  according to NASA scientists  by the melting and collapse of permafrost layers.
The design of the features, bringing to mind the structure of a modern airport with a circular hub from which the long structures housing the airplane gates radiate, can be better visualized when the photograph is reversed.
We have managed to track down the final picture taken by Phobos 2 before it was  shot out of orbit   see above .
One report indicated that it was presented at a closed meeting with US and British officials.
The report confirms that the spacecraft was spinning, either because of a computer malfunction or because Phobos 2 was  impacted  by an unknown object.
And so we see that it is not only NASA that is apparently involved in suppressing photographs and knowledge of other planets, but the Russian space program as well.

UPDATE  Apr.
11, 2014 at 16:00 UTC : The following post contains some corrections that I have clarified in a follow-up article .
Please read that when you re done here.
Thanks!
Apparently April is the month to debunk astronomical foolishness, for I have yet another bit of space silliness to disassemble.
Yesterday, the Houston Chronicle ran a story showing a picture from the Mars Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the fourth rock from the Sun since August 2012.
As the rover moves over the Martian surface it deploys an arsenal of tools to examine its environment.
That, of course, includes cameras.
Many of the pictures are visually stunning, and some are plain old weird.
After all, they’re shots of the landscape on an alien world!
Phil Plait writes Slate’s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!
But some folks take the word “alien” a bit too metaphorically.
In the Chronicle article, the writer, Carol Christian, points out one particular picture  shown above  that depicts a spray of light that looks to be off in the distance.
Right, artificial.
That’s the first conclusion we should jump to.
Yes, you read that right.
The Houston Chronicle is repeating a story they found on a UFO conspiracy site.
When I saw the picture, I knew right away it wasn’t from some artificial source.
It wasn’t even really a light source on Mars!
I’ve worked with astronomical cameras for many, many years, and we see little blips like this all the time.
To make sure though, I asked my friend Emily Lakdawalla , who is also a planetary scientist and journalist.
Her immediate response: cosmic ray.
UPDATE  Apr.
8 at 20:00 UTC : The plot thickens; Justin Maki, a scientist at JPL, s ays this may be a sunglint off a rock , and not a cosmic ray.
That s certainly possible!
As I note below, though, it only appears in one camera and not the other, so I m not quite convinced yet.
However, I ll wait a little while and see what shakes out of this, so I don t post a lot of confusing updates and corrections!
Ah, of course.
Cosmic rays are charged subatomic particles  like protons, electrons, and so on  zipping around in space.
On Earth, our atmosphere absorbs them so they don’t have much of an effect on cameras down here.
But if you put a telescope in space, they are bombarded by these little beasties.
When a cosmic ray slams into the electronic detector in the camera, it deposits some energy in the pixel  or pixels  where it hits.
These detectors are designed to detect energy from incoming light, and they can’t tell the difference between a cosmic ray hit and a photon coming from a distant star.
All they do is register the energy  you can read a lot more about this on a page where I dismantled claims about Planet X  .
And that’s what we have here.
Curiosity was taking a picture of the Martian horizon, and during the time the picture was taken, a subatomic particle smacked into the camera, leaving behind its trail of energy.
It’s a camera artifact, not a real one.
How can I know the light isn’t real, and is just inside the camera itself?
Because the camera is the NAVCAM , which is actually two cameras, one on the right and one on the left.
This provides a binocular view of the landscape, which can be used  just like our own eyes do  to determine distances to objects.
At the same time NAVCAM RIGHT took the picture with the light in it, NAVCAM LEFT also took a picture … and there’s no light.
See?
It’s in one camera’s picture but not the other, even though they were taken at the same time  on April 3, 2014, at 10:00:03 UTC .
As you can see, the landscape shifts a bit due to the different perspectives of the two cameras.
The light is in one shot, but not the other.
I’ll note we see this kind of thing all the time, including in Curiosity images.
Here’s one over a rock , for example.
It’s not hard to find more if you peruse the Curiosity raw images archive  or the Unmanned Spaceflight forum , where space aficionados post and discuss the latest images from various missions .
So that’s what we have here.
It’s not some alien rave, or a stranded bug-eyed monster signaling for help, or other fanciful fiction.
No, it’s far more mundane, merely the quantized energy deposited by a subatomic particle that was accelerated in the magnetic fields of an exploded star and traveled thousands of light years across the galaxy at nearly the speed of light to finally slam into an electronic camera mounted on a mobile nuclear-powered laser-eyed chemical laboratory humans sent to another planet.
Clearly, reality’s not cool enough.
We need to add aliens to make this a story.
Sigh.

Alien Weapon Found On Mars?
Whatever you do, don’t remark about how it looks like an upside down sex toy.
Those Marvin the Martian shorts by Warner Brothers may not be entirely fiction, finds Paranormal Crucible.
The Curiosity rover has sent back images that some people are calling a weapon.
Just looking at the photo, one would believe they’re legit making for an excellent link to share on the Facebooks.
Watch the video, it becomes clear there’s a lot of Photoshop shenanigans happening here.
Not only is the artifact darkened, and given a filter, but anything which could give a sense of scale has been cropped out of the image.
Another red flag, they didn’t link to the sauce at NASA’s website.
I’m not saying the possibility of high weirdness on Mars is completely ruled out.
Our red neighbor has nearly 56 million square miles  144 km^2 for the rest of Earth  of rocks and regolith to explore.
And looking at the original image, the “gun” might be something else.

No.
Definitely no.
But let’s just get this conversation out of the way once and for all.
Aliens and archaeology have had a weird relationship for decades.
Human remains in particular have been subject to this fanaticism.
On the one hand, alien enthusiasm has caused for increased interest into certain topics like cranial modification and the Nasca lines.
On the other hand, it can be extremely frustrating having to deal with questions about the alien involvement in the construction of the pyramids or creation of crystal skulls.
Humans are fascinating and amazing creatures that have been able to pull together to create highly imaginative and awe-inspiring monuments.
Since the beginning of our species, we’ve been creatively solving problems, pushing limits, and shaping the world in fantastic ways.
But for many people, human creativity and awesomeness isn’t the reason why we were able to create aqueducts or construct sky high monuments before the industrial revolution.
Aliens.
Aliens are the answer.
Perhaps it is because we’ve hit a point in our human existence where our own earth is not as unknown as it was before.
Perhaps they are searching for the Lost World of Sir Conan Doyle or the great adventures of Allan Quartermain.
For me, our past is the lost world that we can explore.
For others, its space.
It is the unknown that encompasses our planet.
And the way of connecting to this unknown, to finding the lost adventures of our Victorian forefathers, to exposing the truth- the real truth- Aliens.
Here are some of the more popular ‘alien’ related bioarchaeology finds.
Paracas Elongated Skull… Human Skull… Not Alien.
Via Bad Archaeology.
In 1927, a necropolis was discovered by respected Peruvian archaeologist Julio Tello.
He was able to recover 429 mummy bundles that contained remains dating to from around 800 to 100 BCE.
The mummies were some of the best preserved to be found in Peru, and the find led to a better understanding of burial practices for this period.
Each mummy was wrapped in cotton cloths with detailed embroidery, placed in a sitting position facing north, and buried in the Necropolis.
All were male and all had high quality grave goods suggesting that they were of higher status than the average person.
Another way that there high status was recognized, is that many of them had skulls that were heavily altered and elongated.
The cultural deformation of skulls is well understood and documented in a number of cultures  you can learn more about the actual process here  .
However, this explanation wasn’t enough for some people.
Some theorized that the deformation in the skull was a natural phenomenon, and these elongated skulls were evidence for a new type of species, likely with alien origins.
Over the last few years, there have been a number of pseudo-archaeologists who have gotten their hands on tissue samples from these skulls and argue that they have DNA proof that these are alien species.
Sadly for us, they aren’t actually sharing any of the DNA tissue results, nor are we given any actual data- just their final conclusion that these are aliens.
If you’d like to learn the whole story, and just how bad their investigation was, I’d suggest checking out this amazing article about it on Bad Archaeology: The Paracas Skulls .
They are not.
They are humans with modified crania- no need to jump to alien conclusions.
With that name alone, you know this one is going to be dreadfully awesome.
Starchild Skull- also not an alien, just a child with a genetic condition, via Wikimedia.
In 1999, a paranormalist claimed to have obtained a child’s skull from a couple in El Paso, Texas who originally acquired it from a mine tunnel in the 1930s in Mexico.
The skull was found buried alongside the remains of an adult female.
As it is easy to see from the picture, the skull is extremely enlarged in the cranium, much like the aliens from Mars Attack!
5 to 5 years  based on the dentition found in the skull  and the cranium is 1,600 cubic centimeters, which is 200 cm³ larger than the average adult’s brain, and 400 cm³ larger than an adult of the same approximate size.
Based on this, the paranormalist claimed that this child was the result of a normal female human breeding with an extraterrestrial or was perhaps the result of genetic experimentation.
Luckily for us, real scientists conducted two separate DNA tests in 1999 and 2003.
The first found that the child was a human male that received an x and y chromosomes from each of his human male and human female parents.
The second recovered Mitochondrial DNA from the skull, and determined that it is indeed a human child, though one that likely suffered from congenital hydrocephaly.
Congenital hydrocephaly is more commonly known as “water on the brain”, and it is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the cavities of the brain.
This leads to increased pressure and enlargement of the head of the individual.
It can also result in death.
There are a couple ways you can take this: 1  obviously this chick doesn’t know the real truth, or 2  the human body is an amazing thing that can be changed naturally by disease or modified through human intervention- aren’t we a cool species!
Personally, I think its amazing how bones can respond to pressure, internally and externally.
Sure, aliens would be cool.
But I’m content for now to look at the amazing human skeletal system, and watch alien movies in my free time.
Re the paracas skulls; have you examined them yourself?
Can you provide accurate measurements of the cranial capacities?
Are you aware of the anomalous suture lines and unusual proportions of the jaws and eye sockets?
Do you think that this level of deformation  and increased size  could be achieved by binding alone?
Just because we know about cranial deformation, that does not mean that all anomalous skulls are typical examples.
Just because ‘paranormalists’ investigate something  nice derogatory term to begin the usual ad hominem attacks so common in todays skeptic movement  does not mean that there is not the possibility that there is something very interesting and unusual here.

You may recall, NASA recently announced that a strange rock had somehow  appeared  in front of its Mars Opportunity rover.
The explanations for the mystery rock were straight-forward: maybe some kind of nearby impact sent a rock toward the rover, or, more likely, the rover knocked the rock out of the ground and no one noticed until later.
Not so, says self-described scientist Rhawn Joseph, an author of trade books on topics ranging from alien life to the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks .
Sample article:   Dreams and Hallucinations: Lifting the Veil to Multiple Perceptual Realities .   The rock was a living thing, and he s filed a lawsuit to compel NASA to examine the rock more closely.
Joseph is involved with the Journal of Cosmology, online publisher of some very controversial papers.
In fact, this isn t the first report of alien life to come out of the journal .
For the record: NASA has identified it as a rock .
A very special rock, with rare properties, even.
But definitely a rock.
Okay?
Good.
The  rock,  according to the lawsuit, was there the whole time, it just grew until it became visible.
Joseph has contacted multiple NASA employees and provided them with said evidence, according to the lawsuit, but they have failed to respond.

Mars vs.
Europa: Are we looking in the wrong place for alien life?
This graphic shows the relative sizes of Earth, Mars and Europa, an icy moon of Jupiter.
A British astrobiology conference has revived a years-old debate over the best place to look for life elsewhere in the solar system: Mars, or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn?
The Telegraph quoted Robert Pappalardo , a senior research scientist at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as saying on BBC Radio 4.
Pappalardo s remarks were occasioned by this week s astrobiology conference at the UK Center for Astrobiology in Edinburgh, Scotland.
The center recently established the  International Subsurface Astrobiology Laboratory , or ISAL, half a mile  1 kilometer  beneath the surface in Yorkshire s Boulby mine.
Biologists will use that facility to see how organisms hold up in extreme environments, learn about life s chemical signatures, and test instruments that could look for those signatures on other worlds.
Someday, one of the worlds may well be Europa, an icy moon of Jupiter .
With a diameter of 1,945 miles  3,130 kilometers , Europa is just slightly smaller than Earth s moon, and yet it is thought to contain more water than Earth s oceans beneath a miles-deep layer of ice .
Researchers recently suggested that hydrogen peroxide in the ice could serve as an energy supply for simple forms of life in the ocean hidden below.
Europa is the focus of Pappalardo s research, and for months he has been urging NASA to support a $2 billion mission to study Europa at close range .
However, proposals for NASA missions to Europa have been losing out, in part because of the cost of missions to Mars.
Last week s federal budget proposal for the next fiscal year provides no funding for a Europa mission , but it does fund Mars missions such as Maven  launching this year , InSight  launching in 2016  and a new science rover  launching in 2020 .
If Europa s ocean is 100 kilometers  62 miles  deep, and all that water were gathered into a ball, it would have a radius of 877 kilometers  545 miles .
This graphic compares that hypothetical ball of Europan water to the size of the Jovian moon itself, as well as all the water on planet Earth.
Europa is thought to have two to three times the volume of water in Earth s oceans.
At February s annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Pappalardo worried that NASA s study of the outer solar system would go  radio-dark  in 2017, when the Cassini mission to Saturn and the Juno mission to Jupiter are both due to end.
He continued that theme in this week s BBC interview.
Imagine 50 years from now, we get a lander there and find signs of life.
Europa isn t the only moon that intrigues astrobiologists: In the Jovian system, Callisto and Ganymede also have icy shells and may hold hidden oceans.
Meanwhile, Cassini has repeatedly observed geysers of water ice rising from the surface of the Saturnian moon Enceladus — suggesting that liquid water and perhaps life may lie beneath the surface .
Saturn s largest moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere and seas of hydrocarbon that some scientists think could harbor a totally alien kind of life .
As for Mars, astrobiologists say hints of life could well lurk beneath the surface .
To some extent, the Red Planet has been winning out over Europa and Enceladus because it s easier to get to.
Moreover, NASA s vision calls for sending astronauts to Mars and its moons in the 2030s .
NASA s robotic missions serve as precursors for those human voyages, as well as steps in a long-term program to learn about life in the universe.
Europa s fans can take heart in the fact that the European Space Agency is planning its own mission to Jupiter s moons: The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE , is due for launch in 2022 and arrival at the Jovian system in 2030.
There s also talk of a sample return mission that would target Enceladus  geysers , and a proposal to drop a boat onto Titan s seas .
So what if all of these worlds — Mars and Europa, Callisto and Ganymede, Titan and Enceladus — turn out to be lifeless?
Charles Cockell, who heads the UK Center for Astrobiology, addressed that scenario in an interview with the BBC .
A lot of people think astrobiology is some sort of hunt for life, and if we don t find life, it will be a big disappointment,  Cockell said.  But in fact, that s not the case.
The discovery of many lifeless planets across the universe, the discovery that the Earth might be unique as a place for life, would be an astonishing discovery in itself.
Scientists have a lot of ideas when it comes to exploring Mars, but one research team is eyeing a very unique approach.
Basically: Shoot a few missiles at the Red Planet.
Dubbed the ExoLance project, the initiative aims to fire arrowlike “penetrators” into the surface of Mars.
The goal?
3 feet, which is the depth at which researchers believe microbial life could be capable of surviving on the barren planet.
The nonprofit Explore Mars Inc.
Mars, likely as a secondary payload on another mission, which can then fly out and launch the “penetrator” missiles into the planet’s surface.
It’s a cool idea, and they’re currently raising money to test the concept in New Mexico.
Sadly, the crowdfunding effort has largely failed, and they’ve essentially hit the wall of what they can afford for the moment.
But the science  apparently  seems sound.
Joe Cassady, executive director for space at California-based firm Aerojet Rocketdyne, noted their simulations have all returned very positive results.
We are encouraged by these preliminary results that the fundamental concept of the ExoLance design can be made to work.
McKay also contends that the underground is our “best place to search” for preserved organic remains of past life.
What do you think?
Is shooting mini-exploratory missiles into Mars a good idea?
What do you think we ll find below the surface?
This is the rat lizard alien that the Mars rover Curiosity recently spotted on the red planet .
FULL DISCLOSURE: just a rock.
Now the conspiracy theorists would have you believe the government is just trying to cover up the Martian discovery, but those are the same people who don t wash their hair often enough.
Never trust a person who doesn t wash their hair often enough.
Unless they re homeless, in which case they have a good excuse not to, but still don t trust them when they ask you for change to ride the bus.
It s for drugs or alcohol.
Hit the jump for an ultra-poor quality closeup so all the hours some nutjob spent super-zooming into pictures from Mars wasn t in vain.
Thanks to Matt, who told me if he had a dime for every time somebody thought they saw an alien in some rock formation on Mars he s not sure how much money he d have.
It s not a rat lizard on Mars.
It s a rat lizard in the desert, where Curiosity is.
Martian alien rats-lizards taste like Earth chicken.
Some people want to believe so badly that they see things that aren t really there.
Do I believe there is other life out there somewhere?
Yes.
Do I believe that we have been visited by that life?
No; if we had, I m sure we d all know it by now and not be thinking that rare natural phenomenons are  possibly  aliens.
Cause seriously, who wants to see alien privates?
I know GW does!
My hopes were shattered far too early in the day to be healthy.

Hoagland’s journey of “truth” began after completing an extensive examination of the Cydonia region of Mars, which contains the legendary Face and Giza-like pyramids.
Though the image of the Face was dismissed as a trick of shadow and light over two decades ago, its legacy persists in conspiracy theory circles.
For Hoagland, there’s more going on than optical illusions: there’s a full-scale NASA coverup.
He cites the still-unsolved disappearance of the Mars Observer as evidence.
More importantly, he claims to have decoded a “tetrahedral geometry” to Cydonia, which suggests that its surface features are actually the ruins of an extraterrestrial civilization.
In addition to pyramids, he asserts the existence of a Sphinx- completing a full cycle of Egyptian verisimilitude.
On to the moon….
After color-correcting and enhancing photographic images originally collected from the Apollo missions in the 60s and 70s, Hoagland claims to have discovered evidence of ancient lunar engineering: the existence of vast, semi-transparent geometric superstructures, including a mile-high crystal castle named the Tower of Babel.
He cites as evidence a 1955 Disney movie called Man in Space, a dramatization of a journey to the moon in which a geometric structure on the lunar surface is revealed.
BOTH the director, Wernher Von Braun, a rocket engineer, Nazi SS officer, and close friend to Heinreich Himmler, AND producer Walt Disney were Scottish Rite Freemasons, as were, incidentally, four of the twelve men who walked on the moon.
But wait, so why have the Apollo astronauts never mentioned seeing artifacts of aliens, glass castles soaring above the lunar horizon?
According to conspiracists, it’s because they were hypnotized by the occult secret society of  Masonic bloodlines  controlling NASA.
Lunar engineering?
I watched a Stephen Hawking documentary in which he suggested aquatic alien civilizations made live under the vast frozen sea on the outer moon Titan.
Crazy to think about.
The possibilities are endless.
Some scientists say advanced alien civilizations may live near the centers of galaxies and harvest energy from the black holes.
It’s hard to say for sure whether aliens have been within our solar system, but it’s certainly worth investigating, especially given the multitude of reputable astronauts and military pilots who have reported UFOs in orbit and in the upper atmosphere.
The solar system has been here for a long time, plenty of time for a wayward civilization to plant its seed, or at least leave a few mementos.
It’s hard for governments like ours to spend large amtuons of money on things that are:a  very expensiveb  out in the public viewc  not exciting in some wayWhich, sadly, our space program was all 3.
Most of the information presented here is other people’s research, books, thoughts.
Nothing is stated as fact.
Thought experiments for people who like to experiment with thought.
Don’t shoot the messenger.
USA was built on what ?
USA has always put their noses in conflicts that had nothing to do with USA’s freedom.
Maybe you should do your homework.
Theretical is one thing  and most beliefs are theoretical  but Truth is experience.
Beliefs are rarely reality.

Buzz Aldrin, the second human to walk on the moon, took to Reddit on Tuesday to promote the 45th anniversary of the July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 moon landing.
Returning to the Moon with NASA astronauts is not the best usage of our resources.
I thought that the movie  Gravity,  the depiction of people moving around in zero gravity, was really the best I have seen.
The free-falling, the actions that took place between two people, were very, I think, exaggerated, but probably bent the laws of physics.
But to a person who s been in space, we would cringe looking at something that we hoped would NEVER, EVER Happen.
S.
Returning to the Moon with NASA astronauts is not the best usage of our resources.
Because OUR resources should be directed to outward, beyond-the-moon, to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of Mars that can be built, assembled, from the close-by moons of Mars.
With very little time delay - a second or less.
Much better than controlling things on the Moon from the Earth.
So when NASA funding comes up for review, please call your lawmakers to support it.
Some people may be rooting for Elon -- I think he could, with his Space X, contribute considerably, enormously, to an international activity not only at the moon but also on Mars.
I have considered whether a landing on Mars could be done by the private sector.
It conflicts with my very strong idea, concept, conviction, that the first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth.
They should be the beginning of a build-up of a colony   settlement, I call it a  permanence.  A settlement you can visit once or twice, come back, and then decide you want to settle.
Same with a colony.
But you want it to be permanent from the get-go, from the very first.
There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies.
The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space.
I know that many people don t feel that that should be done.
Some people even consider it distinctly a suicide mission.
Not me!
Not at all.
Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of 6-7 years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon.
Tourism trips to Mars and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from Earth - to have an individual company, no matter how smart, send people to Mars and bring them back, it is VERY very expensive.
It delays the obtaining of permanence, internationally.
I met Carl Sagan and his wife.
Both were very dedicated people to explaining to young people and to all people the benefits to be derived from space, the history of how our universe was formed, and the history of the advancement of the technologies that hundreds of years ago, enabled present day nations to use them to begin to add more science discoveries in space.
And to write stories and television series that reach many people and after his passing away, you have a rejuvenation of the series COSMOS, featuring a very good friend of mine, Neil deGrasse Tyson.
We were on a commission together to look at the future of space activities for the United States, that was about 12 years ago, and we ve been good friends ever since.
I was on his TV show.
There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies.
The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space.
It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on Earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.
But the distances involved in where some evidence of life may be, they may be hundreds of light-years away.
Well,  30 Rock  means 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
My father, in 1925, 1926, in the Reserve of the Air Corps, worked as Aviation Fuel Manager for Standard Oil of New Jersey, that s where I lived at that time, and he would go into NYC and work at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
So when I was asked to consider participating, I jumped for joy, and I can t remember a more pleasant episode of discussions with Tina Fey as we talked about her fictitious mother s  I think it was  love affair that she had with me, Buzz Aldrin.
Realize that you are perhaps the most ambitious, the most historical pioneers that the Earth has produced since its beginning.
And you are given a great honor in spending the rest of your lives pioneering for mankind.

Before-and-after images of the same patch of ground in front of NASA s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity 13 days apart showing the  rock .
ITS appearance initially baffled scientists at NASA, the US space agency.
A strange oddly-shaped white rock mysteriously appeared in images taken less than two weeks apart by NASA  s Mars rover Opportunity , which is looking for signs of past water , the space agency reported on January 17.
When NASA s Opportunity rover took an image of the site on January 8 the white rock was clearly visible yet two weeks earlier it sent back images of barren rock.
An artist’s rendering released by NASA shows the NASA rover Opportunity on the surface of Mars.
Yet NASA said the appearance of the rock was straightforward - perhaps nearby impact sent the rock toward the rover, or, most likely, Opportunity knocked the rock from the ground and no one noticed until later.
NASA s claims don t wash with self-described scientist and author Rhawn Joseph .
He has filed a lawsuit in the US District Court Northern District of California claiming the white rock was a living thing and is seeking an order forcing NASA and its Administrator, Charles Boulden, to investigate the rock more diligently.
Joseph does not believe it to be a rock.
The  rock,  according to the lawsuit, was there the whole time, it just grew until it became visible.

A FORMER US marine has sensationally claimed that he has spent nearly a decade battling ALIENS on Mars.
The ex marine, who goes by the name of Captain Kaye, says that there are five human colonies on the Red Planet and he has spent 17 years fighting to protect them.
Serving in a space fleet known as the Earth Defense Force – that recruited military personnel from countries like America, Russia and China – the one-time ex-naval infantryman was trainee to fly a variety of bombers and Star Wars-style space fighters.
He then spent his time protecting the colonies from martians, who presumably wanted to take over and make the planet their own.
Captain Kaye s incredible testimony to ExoNews TV doesn t end with Mars, either.
Spacecraft training apparently took place on the MOON, as well as on Saturn s moon Titan and even in deep space.
His retirement ceremony after 20 years of service also took place on the moon, with guests including ex US Scretary of Defence Donald Rumsfield.
We know you re all laughing now – but what if he s telling the TRUTH?

Astronomer Philip Plait is tired of radio personality Richard Hoagland s claims.
He s had enough of Hoagland s assertions that NASA is covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life, that the infamous Face on Mars was built by sentient aliens and, of late, that otherworldly machine parts are embedded in the Red Planet s dirt.
And then there s the mile-long translucent martian worm.
On Hoagland s Web site, there are several images from various space probes said to possibly show evidence for ETs.
Recent Mars rover photos include not just rocks, Hoagland and other contributors maintain, but common objects that might tell of an alien civilization -- a bowl, a stove, a piston.
Since 1983, Hoagland said he has led  an outside scientific team in a critically acclaimed independent analysis of possible intelligently-designed artifacts  on other worlds, using spacecraft data from NASA and other missions.
But last week Plait took his intellectual gloves off.
Plait has two words for the latest claims of alien objects on Mars.
The first is  garbage.  The second and more scientific word is  pareidolia.  This is the same phenomenon that makes us see animals or other familiar objects in clouds.
Plait said of pareidolia.
Plait took a picture of the liquid Lenin and uses it illustrate his contention that, though objects on the surface of Mars can sometimes take on interesting shapes, they are just a bunch of rocks.
Hoagland s claims irritate me because he is promoting uncritical thinking,  Plait said.  He doesn t want you to think about what you re seeing.
Critical thinking is the foundation of science, but Plait thinks it s also an important skill for anyone trying to navigate modern society.
Hoagland said the names given to objects shown on his site are nicknames, just as the rover scientists came up with  blueberries  to describe small spherical objects on Mars.
We are not saying there are stoves or pistons on Mars,  Hoagland said in a telephone interview.  Absolutely not.
Hoagland s site, however, does not make this distinction with many rover images.
When is a Rock Not a Rock?
Hoagland said he suggested to scientists on the rover team that they go study the objects up close to determine their composition.
NASA chose not to,  he said.  So we have a hanging mystery.
We don t know what these things are.
Hoagland is routinely critical of Stephen Squyres, a Cornell University astronomer who is mission manager for the Mars rover mission.
Squyres did not respond to a query regarding Hoagland s claims.
It should be pointed out that NASA is not in the practice of commanding its rovers based on suggestions from people outside the agency or from beyond the Spirit and Opportunity science teams, which together include dozens of leading geologists and other scientists from inside the agency and from universities around the country.
Philip Plait is an astronomer who develops space-related classroom materials at Sonoma State University in California and also works in public outreach on various NASA missions.
He spends his spare time working to right the cosmic wrongs -- big and small -- promulgated by the popular media and around the Internet.
He is frequently invited to talk to large gatherings of astronomers, who appreciate his efforts to correct mistakes in the popular media.
Lately, Plait has heard Hoagland explain his views frequently on the late-night Coast to Coast AM radio show, which is heard on hundreds of stations.
Meanwhile, a phenomenal flow of images from NASA s Mars rovers has created a cottage industry in scientific speculation about the Red Planet, at Hoagland s site and elsewhere.
I ve let this fester long enough,  Plait wrote recently on his site, badastronomy.com.  This kind of pseudoscience is like a virus.
An image from the Mars Global Surveyor is said on Hoagland s site to be a gargantuan, glass-like worm that s a mile long.
Plain as a pig in the clouds, the image does indeed evoke the shape and features of a worm at the bottom of a canyon.
Evenly spaced arcs even resemble ribs.
Plait said the most likely explanation for the rib-like features is that they re sand dunes, created by wind blowing through the valley.
An apparent bit of spacecraft debris from the rover mission, photographed by Spirit, was dubbed a  bunny  by some.
Hoagland later said the bunny had been optically removed by NASA.
Plait and other scientists question Hoagland s credentials and say he is prone to inflating his accomplishments.
Hoagland did not graduate from college.
He said he was  possibly the youngest museum curator in the country  in the mid-1960s at age 19.
He is a science writer with a keen interest in space.
Hoagland lists among his awards having received the Angstrom Medal for Excellence in Science.
But there s a catch.
Uppsala University in Sweden, with approval from Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, gives out the Angstrom Prize, which includes a medal and a cash award, given in the honor of 18th Century Swedish scientist Anders-Jonas Angstrom.
Hoagland s medal, however, came from the separate Angstrom Foundation Aktiebolag  AFAB .
This is a privately-owned company with no connection to Uppsala University or the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Ralph Greenberg, a professor of mathematics at the University of Washington.
Others who have researched Hoagland s medal say it carries little if any merit and was not awarded by scientists or a scientific organization.
Greenberg began looking into Hoagland s background for another reason.
In a January 1980 article in the popular magazine Star & Sky, Hoagland wrote of the possibility of an ocean of water under the ice of Jupiter s moon Europa and that life might have arisen there.
Greenberg heard Hoagland s claim and did a review of scientific literature  Star & Sky, now defunct, was not a scientific journal  and other writings and lectures.
Greenberg found that the ideas of water and life under Europa had both been put forth before January 1980.
The first known suggestion that Europa might harbor a liquid ocean was in a 1971 paper by John S.
Lewis in the widely respected science journal Icarus.
The idea was discussed in other papers in the mid-1970s by Lewis and by other scientists.
The possibility of that Europa s hypothesized ocean could support life was discussed in June 1979 -- six months before Hoagland s article -- by Benton Clark at a conference at NASA s Ames Research Center.
Greenberg said.
Greenberg said Hoagland deserves some credit for helping to popularize the Europa ideas.
But he is bothered that Hoagland does not make an effort to set the record straight.
Greenberg said.
I don t think  really has any scientific credentials.
He s not a trained scientist in any sense.
He knows some facts.
I don t think he has any depth of knowledge.
NASA and the current rover mission are gaining legs.
Hoagland said via e-mail over the weekend that his claim to an ocean at Europa was the first to be based on Voyager 1 and 2 imagery of Europa, from flybys in March and July 1979, and that his 1980 article was specifically referring to a previous paper that said any water on Europa had likely become frozen.
The question of who s first is tricky,  Hoagland said.  Clearly, I was not the first  to propose an original liquid ocean for Europa.
Greenberg points to the astronomer Carl Sagan as someone who had discussed the Europa ideas with other scientists in the mid-1970s.
Hoagland said.
Hoagland also said the author Arthur C.
Clarke has mentioned him as the originator of the life-on-Europa idea.
Hoagland is perhaps best known for promoting the Viking Orbiter s  Face on Mars  image as evidence for an alien civilization.
Interestingly it was NASA that started discussion over the face-like features.
Shadows in the rock formation give the illusion of a nose and mouth.
Hoagland finds interest in much more than the Face itself.
He maintains that drawing lines between features in the Cydonia region around the face creates angles that involve complex mathematical formulas and geometric relationships that could only point to intelligent construction.
Plait analyzes the math and methodology.
He said the precision of angles and distances that Hoagland claims is greater than is possible given the images from which Hoagland works.
Moreover, Plait wonders why Hoagland picks certain hills to include in his diagrams instead of other nearby hills that appear indistinguishable.
Hoagland could be benefiting, he said, by picking the points that, through random chance, indeed form patterns.
Plait said.
Hoagland, in response, said Plait should talk with others who have checked the math and shown it to be solid.
Hoagland said, adding that the idea has a lot of adherents around the world.
His beef with NASA is that the space agency should conduct systematic studies -- based on standards that he would be involved in setting -- to answer the questions he poses.

A Japanese blogger claims to have spotted a lizard running loose on the Martian landscape in a NASA photo.
The blogger alerted the website, UFO Sightings Daily, and incredibly, the “discovery” of “life” on Mars has sparked frenzied speculation.
The photo of the Mars “lizard” shows what looks like a reptile with feet, tail and a head.
Conspiracy theorists speculate it is either a lizard or a rodent of some sort.
The sighting of a “lizard” on the Martian surface has  generated a theory that NASA could be conducting a scientific experiment by artificially planting life on the otherwise barren Red Planet.
However, in the original image captured by a camera on NASA’s Curiosity Rover, which  NASA posted on its website in March, the “lizard” looks like a rock lying lifeless on the ground  see photos below .
But with the benefit of zoom, the presence of alien life is revealed.

Caves have   been found on Mars – and they could be home to alien life, scientists said   on Sunday.
The entrances to seven possible caverns on the slopes of a   16km-high  10mile  Martian volcano called Arsia Mons were spotted by Nasa   satellites.
The find will fuel suggestions that life may exist in  underground   habitats  on the Red Planet.

Source] Mars is the fourth planet in the Solar System , colonized by humans during the mid 21st Century and site of many colonies and military bases of the Three World Empire , the United Americas and other national and industrial organizations.
Mars has two known moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped.
Mars was one of the pillars in the creation of the Three World Empire and was also home to a few colonies established by Weyland Corp .
Karen Sneddon took her apprenticeship with Weyland-Yutani on Mars.
Mars is also home to the Valles Colony.
Terraformed from 2032 to 2040 and established in 2040 by Weyland Corp, Valles had a population of 16,780,000 as of January 1st 2073 .
Valles Colony was established to exploit vast deposits of rare-earth metal.
Valles has five main industries; Mining, Refining, Light and Heavy Manufacturing and five key resources; Niobium, Europium, Neodymium, Copper and Chromium.
In the 22nd century, infantry officers of the United States Colonial Marine Corps were required to take an advanced hostile environments course at Camp Hanneken , located in Valles Marineris.
In Prometheus , the hologram of Peter Weyland was recorded inside a colony on Mars which, at the time of said recording, was still under construction.
This is, without a doubt, the best photo of NASA s Mars rover Curiosity.
Taken on a Martian flat spot called John Klein, the image was just published by scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
It looks she asked someone passing by to take her camera and shoot the picture.
In reality, the photo is a composition of multiple photos taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager  MAHLI  on February 3, 2013.
According to NASA  the self-portrait was acquired to document the drilling site,  but we all know they did it because it is freaking awesome.
The rover s robotic arm is not visible in the mosaic.
MAHLI, which took the component images for this mosaic, is mounted on a turret at the end of the arm.
Wrist motions and turret rotations on the arm allowed MAHLI to acquire the mosaic s component images.
The arm was positioned out of the shot in the images or portions of images used in the mosaic.
Clever!
The result is truly outstanding.
Many have argued that the light in the pictures are undoubtedly artificial, but NASA is claiming that there is an error with the photograph.
This is not a glare from the sun, nor is it an artifact of the photo process.
Look closely at the bottom of the light.
NASA representatives are calling this phenomena a “cosmic ray hit”.
Cosmic rays are very high-energy particles, mainly originating outside the Solar System.
They may produce showers of secondary particles that penetrate and impact the Earth’s atmosphere and sometimes even reach the surface.
Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin.
Data from the Fermi space telescope  2013  have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernovae of massive stars.
However, this is not thought to be their only source.
Active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays.
What do you think about the picture?
Is this light proof of alien life?
Or is it just a rare phenomena of photography?
Could be some kind of reflection… It doesn’t seem like life though.
However, if there was life on Mars and NASA knew, they wouldn’t tell us.
It is actually part of the bill written to form NASA that they can and should hide information that may transform society.
What fear is to recognize that there may be other forms of life.
What the article doesn’t tell you is that the camera has two irises, a left one and a right one.
The image only shows up in one of them, ergo, cosmic ray hit.
End of mystery.
Those lights are to see on moon and mars and Im sure it has an extraterrestrial source.
The problem is more in humanity, humans are not able to understand that we are not alone in our solar system, as long they are not told by their leaders.

If there s one thing to be said for Curiosity s mission on Mars so far, it certainly hasn t been boring.
From supposed Martian squirrels to strange flashes of light on the surface , the rover has kept us entertained.
Although the six-wheeled rover has taken thousands of photographs of Martian rocks, the rich diversity of Mars  landscape has provided many beautiful examples of planetary geology and some geology that is downright weird.
Take this recent photographic example from the Mars Science Laboratory s Mastcam camera that was uploaded to the mission s photo archive on sol 746  Sept.
11  .
While compiling a mosaic of images of the surrounding landscape, Curiosity captured a rather un-Mars-like shape atop a rocky outcrop.
There s a perfect-looking sphere sitting proudly on a flat rock surface.
It s dusty, but under that dust it appears a little darker than the surrounding rock.
At first glance it looks like an old cannonball or possibly a dirty golf ball.
But knowing that Mars is somewhat lacking in the 16th-century battleship and golf cart departments, there was likely another answer.
Of course it s nothing man  or alien -made, despite what your brain might be telling you.
It s another fascinating rock.
Yep, it s a spherical Mars rock.
Their explanation is that it is most likely something known as a   concretion .  Other examples of concretions have been found on the Martian surface before â€” take, for example, the tiny haematite concretions, or  blueberries , observed by Mars rover Opportunity in 2004 â€” and they were created during sedimentary rock formation when Mars was abundant in liquid water many millions of years ago.
By now we all know that Mars used to be a lot wetter than it is now.
Curiosity quickly worked out that it was exploring an ancient lakebed shortly after it landed inside Gale Crater in August 2012.
That ancient lakebed is characterized by obvious layering of sedimentary rock.
On Earth, sedimentary rock is formed through the interaction of liquid water transporting and depositing material â€” the same process also occurred on Mars.
Within the newly forming sedimentary rock, pores are inevitably created and minerals seep into those pores, gradually building up an erosion-resistant mass.
Over time, as the soft sedimentary rock is eroded away, the concretion remains behind.
And this little sphere is one such example â€” the ball has either emerged from the underlying sedimentary rock that has eroded away or, perhaps, it rolled from somewhere else over time.
5 mile-high mountain in the center of Gale Crater, scientists are excited for the rover to begin its next round of drilling operations into the layered rock.
Powdered rock samples will then be analyzed so we can gain an idea about how habitable the Red Planet was throughout its ancient history and whether or not it may have been able to support microbial life.
The long two-year journey from its landing site to Mount Sharp hasn t come without its problems, however.
An unanticipated amount of wear and tear by the craggy Mars surface has taken its toll on Curiosity s wheels , causing dents, punctures and rips in the thin aluminum.
This has prompted rover drivers to drive the rover backwards to limit the damage and to get help from NASA s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to image the surrounding landscape, finding the smoothest routes.
But so far, so good, Curiosity is at Mount Sharp to continue its scientific investigation into Mars  habitable history.
So we can expect many more examples of interesting rocks to come, spherical and otherwise.
Many thanks to JPL s Guy Webster for quickly seeking out an answer to my questions and to Paul Scott Anderson of The Meridiani Journal for tweeting a link to this fascinating photo .

This before-and-after pair of images of the same patch of ground in front of NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity 13 days apart documents the arrival of a bright rock onto the scene.
The rover had completed a short drive just before taking the second image, and one of its wheels likely knocked the rock—dubbed “Pinnacle Island”—to this position.
The rock is about the size of a doughnut.
Arizona State Univ.
For several weeks now conspiracy theorists have been having fun spreading rumors that an object on Mars that “mysteriously” moved is not natural.
S.
District Court of the Northern District of California against NASA, citing the sudden appearance of the rock in a place where it wasn’t before as “proof” of life, and he accused NASA of being unwilling to investigate such an incredible discovery further.
Well, that’s because the rock is exactly that, a rock.
Not a fungus or any other living organism as Joseph and his conspiracy theorist friends claim.
NASA has always known it was a rock; the question, however, was not “what is it” but rather “how did it get there”?
This image from NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity shows where a rock called “Pinnacle Island”  lower left corner  had been before it appeared in front of the rover in early January 2014.
Arizona State Univ.
5-inch-wide, white-rimmed, red-centered rock, which is now dubbed “Pinnacle Island,” was found by NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity on Jan.
8, 2014, and was photographed in a location where older images of the same spot previously showed no object—leading to all kinds of conspiracy theories as to what it could be and where it came from.
Alien rock throwers?
Ejecta from a nearby meteorite impact?
Alien fungus?
After some investigating, which is what NASA does, the space agency now has an explanation, and it’s no different than when you kick up gravel while driving down a dirt road.
Once we moved Opportunity a short distance, after inspecting Pinnacle Island, we could see directly uphill an overturned rock that has the same unusual appearance,” said Opportunity Deputy Principal Investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St.
Louis.
We drove over it.
We can see the track.
The explanation likely won’t convince Joseph and his friends, but it likely won’t warrant a new Mythbusters episode either.
The rock itself is quite interesting, though, at least for a scientist or planetary geologist, because Pinnacle Island contains very high levels of sulfur and manganese, which suggest these water-soluble ingredients were concentrated in the rock by the action of water.
NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity recorded the component images for this self-portrait about three weeks before completing a decade of work on Mars.
The rover’s panoramic camera  Pancam  took the images during the interval Jan.
3, 2014, to Jan.
6, 2014, a few days after winds removed some of the dust that had been accumulating on the rover’s solar panels.
Arizona State Univ.
Now, with the doughnut-rock mystery solved, Opportunity is on approach to a boulder-studded ridge to investigate exposed rock layers on the slope.
The area is informally named the McClure-Beverlin Escarpment, in honor of engineers Jack Beverlin and Bill McClure—the first recipients of the NASA Medal of Exceptional Bravery for their actions on Feb.
14, 1969, to save NASA’s second successful Mars mission, Mariner 6, when the launch vehicle began to crumple on the launch pad from loss of pressure.
Opportunity has now been exploring the Martian surface for a decade and is expected to continue its exploration for quite some time, as long as the rover does not fall victim to any of a thousand different factors that could cripple it  like what happened to its sister rover, Spirit .
We now can expect to have more energy available each week.
What’s more, recent winds removed some dust from the rover’s solar array.
Want to keep up-to-date with all things space?
Great article, I do have a question as per your article you mentioned that this rock contained “very high levels of sulfur and manganese”.
Where does one find the raw data  NOT images  from the instruments from the  Opportunity Rover or do I have to be a credentialed scientist to access this information?
I’m not sure exactly where to get the raw data, as I have not been able to find it  for any spacecraft  available on NASA’s websites.
The Orbital Sciences Corporation Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard, is seen on launch Pad-0A, Sunday, Oct.

Irish director Ruairi Robinson’s sci-fi horror The Last Days on Mars might make space travel enthusiasts a little less eager to emigrate to the planet next door.
Shot on location in Jordan and at Shepperton Studios on the UK, the film tells the story of a group of astronauts who are collecting specimens on Mars when they discover some specimens that probably should have been left behind.
Based on a short story by Sydney James Bounds and adapted by the screen by Clive Dawson  The Bunker , The Last Days on Mars screened at Cannes Film Festival earlier this year and is set for a late 2013 release.
There’s been a fair amount of interest in Robinson’s feature directorial debut since he grabbed attention with 2011 horror short Blinky™ , a cautionary tale about an angry boy  played by Max Records  who pays the price for saying the wrong thing to his home robot helper.
Two new trailers for The Last Days on Mars have now been released, offering a first look at the next stage of Robinson’s directing career.
Be warned that the UK trailer below is red band and contains some rather nasty gore effects.
The trailers give away very little about the plot and main threat of The Last Days on Mars, but they do succeed in showcasing some the ensemble cast who will no doubt be the driving force behind the drama.
In addition to Liev Schreiber, the film also features Elias Koteas, star of David Cronenberg’s Crash as well as more recent thrillers like Zodiac and Shutter Island .
Less well-known actors include Olivia Williams  An Education  and female lead Romola Garai  The Hour .
It’s Schreiber’s visage, however, that heavily dominates the poster for The Last Days of Mars, the formatting of which unfortunately makes it look like a tiny astronaut is running away from a giant Schreiber that’s about to eat him.
One thing that comes across strongly in both trailers is a very clear  Alien  vibe, right down to the characters finding something under the planet’s surface, a crewmember returning to the ship with a broken faceplate and something that looks like it could be a chest-bursting scene.
The other film that will no doubt crop up a lot in comparisons is Duncan Jones’ feature directorial debut Moon , which was also made on a limited budget and was set on one of the desolate wastelands of our solar system.
If Last Days of Mars is an Alien rip-off, however, that’s not necessarily a bad thing; if The Last Days on Mars is going to borrow heavily from another movie then Alien has some very deep pockets.
Besides which, The Last Days on Mars looks just different enough to get away with it, featuring what looks like zombified humans as its main monsters and set on the surface of Mars rather than in the confines of a spaceship.
The Last Days on Mars will be available to order on VOD from October 31st, 2013, and will also receive a limited theatrical release on December 6th.

Me too!
Although we have seen this kind of movie over and over and over again, I still get excited about it.
I love the space horror genre.
Strange planets, strange creatures, the isolation.
Alway makes for good entertainment.
I’d more rather them make a film similar to Aliens than a remake of Aliens.
That way the film has all the freedom without the restrictions of a remake.
I don’t think that filmmakers should feel like they need to work on the franchise themselves in order to use some of their ideas.
Films and art is just a stream of creativity anyway, each film building on what came before it.
This makes no sense at all.
Mutation doesn’t allow an organism that’s whole life has been spent breathing air all of a sudden have the ability to survive mars atmosphere.
I see more piss poor decisions from the scientists made here than the ones made in Prometheus.
How about we wait to see how the film plays out.
Movies do not have to be ENTIRELY realistic.
Actually it doesn’t appear as though the aliens need the bodies to be alive.
If the bodies are dead then they will still work just fine so they don’t require a living host and thus meaning they don’t require oxygen.
Besides it isn’t a mutation.
This is simply a hostile take over and not an altering of the body.
21 gigawatts could ever effective run a flux capacitor.
Dude, it’s a movie, chill out.
Myself  being a biology student it amazes me how much real science and sense .
Myself being a biology student it amazes me how much real science and sense are tossed out the window not to mention this is Just a rip off of Prometheus.
If you have to rip off other movie ideas from film makers then your a  sh*t turd producer a best.
Doesn’t seem like a game-changer by any means but i’m in.
I smell Prometheus all over this.
I think I’ll wait until it hits Bluray.
This seems to have taken a bit, if not much from Prometheus.
Even the trailer tried to do the quick cuts like Prometheus’s trailer.
Guys…it’s just Doctor Who and the Waters of Mars with a big budget.
Seriously.
It is weird how similar they are.
Definitely looks Alien-inspired, but I might give it a peek when it comes out.
Yeah, I was thinking of “Water of Mars,” too when I saw this.
Still, I’d see it.
Could be pretty interesting but the trailer didn’t grab me all that much.
I do like Liev Schreiber though.
It looks like The Thing crossed with Prometheus with a little bit of The Ghosts of Mars mixed in there.
Im tired all I read at first was Shot on location on Mars….
I will see it just to see his and Caseys range.
Now that would be really something.
Damn Zombies.
This genre is getting too tiring.
Even in the world of book publishing it seems 1 in 10 are zombie related.
Doesn’t anybody have any fresh ideas anymore?
This also includes Hollywood with their ‘reboots’.
Looks like a less convoluted Prometheus to me.
But anything can happen.
The planet Mars needs no introduction as a possible candidate for harboring alien life, or for capturing the imagination of man.
Many have opined that Mars has always held a special fascination for mankind, and thus now to humans looking for ET, Mars has rarely been left out of such conversations.
Even though explorations of twentieth century space probes have yet to definitively prove any life exists or has existed there.
Of course, this lack of proof hasn’t stopped people from claiming Mars was once full of intelligent life, and potentially the origin of life on earth.
It’s understandable, there is a romanticism to the idea of life on Mars.
Schiaparelli and later Lowell’s  Martian “canals” of course inspired dozens of science fiction stories like Burroughs’ excellent John Carter novel series, Otis Kline’s lesser known, but just as entertaining Mars Venus stories and a host of others, including CS Lewis’ Out of the Silent Planet.
Many of these stories have been tangentially connected to each other by the intrepid sword and planet fiction expert, Den Valdron whose articles are an entertaining read and quite off topic.
Den, I still love this series of articles, and I’m still waiting for you to explain where Moorcock’s blue giants fit into all of it.
The canals, and other long ago ideas that inspired the idea of Martian life were for the most part dispelled when the Soviets and NASA began to send space probes to Mars .
These probes revealed that Mars is pretty much devoid of life and always has been.
Or did they?
Some sources suggest actual life was found by the Viking Lander , though that claim is not iron clad because that specific test isn’t calibrated well enough to detect life even on Earth, nor does the article address the idea that the probes had bacterial contamination from Earth.
On the odd chance that microbial life was found on Mars, I’m not even sure it would be that big of a deal in actuality .
Jason Colavito points out, bacteria isn’t humanoid or intelligent life.
He also suggested that many times in the past claims for life on Mars have been made, and society still moved on.
Should any such claim be made in the future, it would require very close investigation, but I doubt it would be as huge as folks make it out to be.
At any rate, this claim that Viking found life is probably the most conservative claim of life on Mars, “it’s possible, maybe we did, but we’re not sure”.
From here, less and less reliable claims of life on Mars have been made.
Some two decades after Viking, when I was in high school, I recall seeing a news conference about a meteorite allegedly from Mars.
This meteorite in fact.
The hoopla being that this rock was from Mars, and had fossilized bacteria or some such from Mars.
It’s also not the only meteorite to have that claim as near as I can tell.
And here’s another, though the sign of “life” was a geological formation.
That’s what I remember anyways.
An informal survey of my coworkers revealed that they didn’t recall even that.
And I don’t blame them.
It was basically a sensational headline that most people probably would have missed or dismissed.
At the time, I recall being skeptical,  even though the idea of aliens was no issue to me.
I think, even though I wasn’t a Christian then, I found the whole evolution panspermia thing they were alluding to kind of silly.
I also wondered how they determined it was from Mars in the first place and not just a normal meteroite.
How did they know the alleged bacteria was from Mars and not contamination from Earth?
The idea that a meteorite landed on Mars, kicked up debris that wandered to earth and somehow survived atmosphere entry into earth and still left enough material to study.
It really felt like a stretch.
Fast forward to now, the wiki article mentions what sounds like good science that supports the Martian origin of the meteorite, as well as a halfway decent explanation as to why scientists think it could be life from Mars.
I’m still skeptical, so I’m glad the article also challenges those claims in a fair manner, including the Martian origin and more importantly the claim of Martian life.
Terrestrial contamination is considered a valid possibility, though not a complete explanation.
Still, sufficient doubt exists as scientists were able to reproduce the “signs of life” in a lab without using organic components, though that too was not definitive.
In short the evidence on both sides is incomplete, no one knows for sure if this meteorite actually contained signs of life, and really it seems very hard to say with absolute certainty that it actually came from Mars.
At least without performing further study of Mars.
My gut tells me it’s a normal meteorite, not from Mars, and there aren’t any bacteria fossils.
So really, while there may be others, those few items are the most mainstream claims that life exists or has existed on ancient Mars.
In brief, possible traces of bacterial life on Mars.
Traces that  really are not conclusive without further study.
Nothing solid, and quite circumstantial.
And not really a big deal to anyone’s worldview all around.
With these more realistic claims out of the way, the esoteric claims are just ahead.
Earth.
Some other survivors are said to have relocated underground on Earth and possibly Mars.
Richard Hoagland , this “proof” can be thrown right out as it was obtained by remote viewing.
To say that remote viewing is unreliable would be an understatement.
Many remote viewers tend to employ the tricks of stage magicians or make claims vague enough to be interpreted to fit the desired results.
In the rare cases where there is legitimate viewing going on, and things are supernaturally revealed, it’s probably demonic , much like astral projection .
Moving on from there, a number of individuals in the Christian fringe support the idea of ruins on Mars, and that they are the ruins of fallen angels nephilim either from Mars or from the inhabitants of planet Rahab .
Part of this claim makes use of the gap theory and makes a case for a pre-Adamic race that was judged and is gone now.
That’s not especially Biblical.
The pioneer here would be the late David Flynn .
In Mr.
Flynn’s defense, was a fairly smart guy and he seemed like a sincere believer who was doing his best to explain the origins of something he was convinced was a legitimate thing .
You can hear a couple interviews with Flynn here and come to your own conclusions.
You can also track down his books as well to the same end.
This link takes a critical look at Flynn’s claims as well as the claims about Mars made by other Christians.
To focus in on Flynn’s claims, as I understand them, he essentially connected the Face on Mars and alleged pyramids in the Cydonia region to Satan, by connecting the supposed structures and related geometric measurements to mystery religions here on earth.
Most notably, Freemasonry .
From here, others have hopped on the wagon with the whole ruins in Cydonia thing and even planet Rahab as part of that mythos.
Again, I’m not especially familiar with Flynn’s work, so some of that may be incorrect.
I don’t fault those who have speculated in error necessarily, as I’ve probably done it as well in the past and probably will in the future.
The problem here , though, is that Flynn and other Christian researchers seem to be building their speculative research based not on an appraisal of the actual evidence gathered, or at best a superficial appraisal of that  often outdated  evidence, but rather on the claims of other people who have distorted the evidence and added their own thoughts of various conspiracies and New Age nonsense.
As a result, many of us Christians are being misled into believing things that are not true and twisting scripture to support something that just ain’t so.
The entire Rahab scenario, dealt with in the previous blog, originated probably with the planet Phaeton mythos and the claims of Tom van Flandern.
Van Flandern is pretty thoroughly debunked here .
The Rahab theory really is no different from any other similar theory except that it becomes Satan’s planet, and that these beings left ruins on Mars.
Which is really nonsense.
The other ringleader that most everyone builds off of, the originator and loudest proponent of ruins on Mars and associated  often Masonic  conspiracies and coverups would be none other than Richard C.
Hoagland.
Unfortunately, it would seem that most of Flynn’s work derived from Hoagland and Flynn’s attempt to fit that into a biblical paradigm.
Everyone else following in his footsteps is no better off.
The fact that Hoagland thought quite highly of Flynn’s work should tell you how in line it is with Hoagland’s paradigm, because anyone who isn’t is “paid off” by the establishment.
As is explained in Stuart Robinson’s Pseudo Astronomy Podcast.
Hoagland is a rather persuasive voice to be sure, and in fact nearly had me convinced of not only oxygen on Mars, and NASA cover-ups, but ruins on Mars and the moon.
I had happened upon his book Dark Mission that he had written with Mike Bara.
Bara interview Part One and Part Two  .
That’s all in addition to the ruins and “Data’s head”, which looked more like C3PO.
The problem there is that some of the claims in the book seem to be true.
Few would be able to deny Aleister Crowley’s connection to the occult or Jack Parsons and L.
Ron Hubbard’s connection to him and the occult.
But that’s right about where the facts end.
Where Hoagland gets into trouble, is that he not only claims there were alien structures on the moon, but that the Viking lander found signs of life  see above  and discovered the monuments on Mars.
The face and pyramids located at Cydonia.
He uses these “ruins” to make the case the  Martians were sending a message through geometry and that message is the “truth” of hyper-dimendional physics and certain numbers that are supposed to prove the same.
Ironically, it’s been pointed out how bad his coauthor Bara’s math is and Hoagland isn’t any better at math or geometry .
If Hoagland is right, the best proof of ancient astronaut contact seems not be here on earth, but rather the Cydonia region.
However, if Hoagland is wrong, then the best proof for intelligent life on Mars and ancient alien ruins would be more or less rendered moot until better evidence comes forth.
Thankfully, others have gone ahead and taken a critical look at the lion’s share of Hoagland’s claims for ruins, pyramids,  and hyper-dimensional physics.
First and foremost, the idea for pyramids on Mars came not from NASA photos, but from a science fiction novel “ Edison’s Conquest of Mars “, which is addressed summarized pretty well in one of Valdron’s articles.
The face on Mars too preceded NASA in a Jack Kirby comic.
Now before you cry conspiracy, or that this was to prepare the public, take a good luck at the evidence for ruins and pyramids as follows.
In examining that evidence, it’s reasonable.
Especially in low-resolution images from Mariner and Viking, these hills look pyramidal, and in these early images when contrast is especially high, they look fairly perfect because you see a nice bright side and darker sides that appear nice-’n’-smooth.
And, you can reasonably draw angles and they somewhat come out to even things like 120° on a five-sided one… that’s about as far as it goes.
Now-a-days, we have much better cameras, much better dynamic range…and we can see these features in much more detail.
The pyramidal shape doesn’t go away, unlike the Face on Mars.
But, they are no longer in any way perfect.
The would-be apex is distorted, the sides are curved, the edges are wavy, and the slopes are distorted.
One could simply say that these are eroded features now and that’s why they’re not exact.
That author goes on to describe that more recent, higher resolution photos of the pyramids demonstrate that they are nothing more than mesas, buttes and dunes-natural features.
NASA also explains quite well that the newer photos of Cydonia are much higher resolution, even making it easy to understand.
Because better resolution means more detail.
In order to maintain the mythology of pyramids, proponents have to resort to logical fallacies and ignore new evidence, which is more anti-science than they accuse science of being.
The link for the above quote goes through many of the natural features on display and good evidence as to why they could not be pyramids.
Here’s a quote that sort of makes much of the point about the artificiality of Cydonia .
The same is the case with the broader Cydonia region: There are really countless features to chose from, but in most maps I have seen around 10-25 different features called out.
Then, it’s the angles between them, usually, that are said to be important, and they match the angles within the D&M Pyramid.
With the pyramids most likely being natural in origin, the supposed artificiality and geometric layout of the entire Cydonia region erodes rather quickly.
Hoagland and others assign all kinds of important numbers, seemingly at random, to all kinds of features all over Cydonia, which if they are natural is somewhat meaningless.
Further, any angles in the original pictures and related associations are called into question as the old image resolution doesn’t provide enough data because it was of a much larger area.
Each pixel of the image represents about 200 square feet of space, and therefore any features discerned are not that reliable because the resolution was poor.
This link discusses it in depth and it’s well worth reading.
For a more in-depth discussion of image resolution.
One , Two Three !
Given that Cydonia is just a geologically weird area and not a pyramid complex, the Face of Mars should be easy to discern as well.
Basically, the face is a large mesa .
And this makes sense if Cydonia is full of mesas.
Despite cries of conspiracy and cover up on the part of NASA, NASA is the one who first called it a face, and it only looked like a face due to poor resolution and odd lighting, as discussed in the data on pyramids.
150 years ago where people see familiar features in what is general randomness.
Furthermore, NASA has addressed this face themselves .
Even taking into consideration a desire for secrecy and cover-ups this is an interesting read and answers many questions.
Almost as if NASA is bending over backward to show Hoagland what’s really there.
It really reads like they are appealing to Hoagland to just go away.
Not to mention, for an agency that’s reportedly underfunded, finding an alien artifact would be a sure way to obtain funding.
Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars — evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.
And with that, the entire plot of Mission to Mars or Red Planet  I forget which  is rendered moot.
Rocket Man is still safe though.
Hoagland’s, Flynn’s and other theories about alien monuments on Mars can probably be discarded as incorrect, especially regarding Cydonia.
Those assumptions were built upon old data that was of poor quality, meanwhile higher quality information has come forth and been largely ignored by ruins supporters.
When it is acknowledged, it’s dismissed as “doctored”.
Although this evidence goes a long way to dispel claims of ancient alien life on Barsoom…I mean Mars, there are still more claims to deal with.
Like the nuclear annihilation of Mars.
Of course, with no ruins, the idea of a nuclear destruction becomes kind of unnecessary.
1  Viking landers observed an over-abundance of xenon-129 relative to xenon-132.
2  According to Brandenburg, xenon-129 is only produced during big nuclear events.
Unfortunately, there’s nothing in science that indicates nukes actually can create the observed Xenon-129 .
In supernovae, sure, those produce pretty much everything.
They’re an alchemist’s dream.
But not a nuclear weapon.
MR.
Robinson, the author of the article goes on to describe geological processes that could produce the xenon-129 without the need for nukes.
Although we disagree about the Biblical creation account, it’s good reading and explains quite thoroughly why Mars was probably not wiped out by ET atomic bombs.
There are quite a few more likely natural ways to account for the overabundance of this element.
It’s also good to read because it picks up on a staple of ancient astronaut claims.
That is, an anomaly or supposed anomaly can “only” be explained as a result of a certain, specific something else, usually aliens.
Anyone looking to debunk ancient astronaut claims on their own should note every time one of those AA “researchers” says the “only” explanation is X, and then find other explanations for it.
That’s called critical thinking.
Wrapping up, a few other Mars oddities can be dealt with.
And the Phobos 2 probe had a failed computer as opposed to being destroyed by aliens.
Much to the dismay of my younger self, the ruins of Mars really are natural features and it’s not likely evidence of Barsoom, Tharks or John Carter’s adventures will ever be found.
Because they aren’t there.
No one is more disappointed by this fact than I am.
Especially since his use of logical fallacies and cheap shots outweigh his ability to provide solid evidence.

New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from     NASA s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars     for what it really is: a mesa.
May     24, 2001 -- Twenty five years ago something funny happened     around Mars.
NASA s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,     snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship     Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.
An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be     staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called     Cydonia.
There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers     back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their     monitors.
But the sensation was short lived.
Scientists figured     it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia,     only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian     Pharaoh.
Above: A 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars.
Click     here for a 2001 photo from Mars Global Surveyor that reveals     the true appearance of the Face.
A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see.
The caption noted a  huge rock     formation ... which resembles a human head ... formed by shadows     giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.  The     authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public     and attract attention to Mars.
It certainly did!
The  Face on Mars  has since become a pop icon.
It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,     radio talk shows -- even haunted grocery store checkout lines     for 25 years!
Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide,     say conspiracy theorists.
Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget     wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.
Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact,     photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor  MGS  arrived at the Red Planet in Sept.
1997, eighteen     long years after the Viking missions ended.
Jim Garvin, chief     scientist for NASA s Mars Exploration Program.
And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over     Cydonia for the first time, Michael     Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera  MOC  team snapped a picture     ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.
There was no alien monument after all.
Above: Side by side: a Viking 1 photo from 1976, a Mars     Global Surveyor  MGS  image from 1998, and the latest MGS image     from 2001.
View     the 2001 photo in dazzling high-resolution!
But not everyone was satisfied.
The Face on Mars is located     at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April      98 -- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.
The camera on     board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.
Perhaps,     said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.
Mission controllers prepared to look     again.
Garvin.
5 km-wide strips.
Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 -- a     cloudless summer day in Cydonia -- Mars Global Surveyor drew     close enough for a second look.
Garvin.
56 meters,     compared to 43 meters per pixel     in the best 1976 Viking photo.
Right:  Gee, it doesn t look like a face to me!      by artist Duane Hilton .
What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent     of a butte or mesa -- landforms common around the American West.
Garvin.
Cydonia is littered with mesas like the Face, but the others     don t look like human heads and they ve attracted little popular     attention.
Garvin and other members of the MGS Science Team have     studied them carefully, however, using a laser altimeter called       MOLA       on board Mars Global Surveyor.
MOLA can measure the heights of things with a vertical precision     of 20 to 30 cm  its horizontal resolution is 150m .
We     took hundreds of altitude measurements of the mesa-like features     around Cydonia,  says Garvin,  including the Face.
The height of the Face, its volume and aspect ratio -- all of     its dimensions, in fact -- are similar to the other mesas.
The laser altimetry data are perhaps even more convincing     than overhead photos that the Face is natural.
3D elevation maps     reveal the formation from any angle, unaltered by lights and     shadow.
There are no eyes, no nose, and no mouth!
Above: A 3D perspective view of the Face on Mars landform     produced by Jim Garvin  NASA  and Jim Frawley  Herring Bay Geophysics      from the latest MOC image  April 8, 2001  and all of the available     laser altimeter elevation measurements by MOLA.
There is no vertical     exaggeration in this ray-traced image.
Garvin and Frawley express     special thanks to Mike Malin and MOLA science team.
See also these false-color 3D views of the Face with approximately 10:1 vertical exaggeration.
The mesas of Cydonia are of great interest to planetary geologists     because they lie in a curious part of Mars, in a transition zone     between cratered highlands to the south and smoother lowland     plains to the north.
Some scientists think the northern plains     are all that s left of an ancient Martian ocean.
If so, Cydonia     might have once been beachfront property.
Garvin.
The mesas could have been gouged by glaciers,     carved by winds and water, or thrust upward by vertical tectonics.
Below: Cydonia  labeled blue      inhabits a transition zone between southern highlands and a northern     plain that perhaps once contained a Martian ocean.

Perhaps the     best way to unravel the mystery would be to send a geologist     to investigate.
And Garvin, an enthusiastic climber, wouldn t     mind going himself.
I can imagine myself staring up at this 800-foot-high     mass of rock with steep flanks,  he says,  the same     as Middle Butte in Idaho.
The latest MGS images of the Face are so detailed     that Garvin already knows what route he would take -- he s even     prepared a trail map !
The start     and midsection of the hike would be easy, with some steep flanks     in between.
From there the view would be spectacular,  he continued.      To the south the ground would slope upwards, toward the     highlands.
To the north the terrain would descend toward the     plains.
Garvin.
That s     why the Face on Mars was so popular: it reinforced that connection.
But even without an alien monument, there will be plenty for     future explorers to do.
Climbing the mesas of Cydonia --if that s     where we start-- will be just the beginning.
Unmasking the Face on Mars wasn t easy!
But Michael Malin     and his team at Malin Space Science     Systems have done it by virtue of their hard work targeting     the Face with the Mars Orbiter Camera  MOC .

UFO spotters are claiming they have spotted an alien skull on Mars after NASA beamed back satellite images from the planet.
At first glance it looks like a rocky desert - but this image of the Mars landscape has got space-gazers talking.
An oddly shaped space boulder appears to show eye sockets and a nose leading to speculation it might be a Martian skull.
Internet forums are full of chatter about the picture, taken by a panoramic NASA camera known as Spirit.
The skull is 15 cm with binocular eyes 5 cm apart.
The cranial capacity is approximately 1400 cc.
The coronal ridge shows ample structure to support the musculature of antennae, although none are visible in this view.
The nose area is broad and blunted as you would expect to see in a cold and windy landscape.
Previous images of a skull spotted on Mars in 2006  were believed to have been the result of tampering.
If we re all Martians now, who are the aliens?
Prof Steven Benner told the Goldschmidt meeting , this week s international scientific convention in Florence.
The theory that microbes from Mars  infected  the Earth via meteorites, finding conditions here more conducive to their evolution, is nothing new.
But Benner s theory, that the minerals essential to life s formation were only readily available on Mars, is.
Such a notion challenges almost every aspect of human culture, from biology to philosophy and faith – and practically every science fiction scenario in the book.
Long before HG Wells  War of the Worlds threatened the home counties with a Martian invasion, we humans were looking up at the red planet, coursed as it seemingly was by canals constructed by extraterrestrials, imagining the worst.
From John Wyndham s scary triffids to Tim Burton s kitsch Mars Attacks!
How ironic to discover that we were the aliens all along.
There are serious questions here.
For centuries philosophers have pondered the effect that the discovery of extraterrestrial life might have on human religions – could Christianity sustain itself in the light of evidence that we are not alone?
One has to admire the sheer optimism of modern science: I love the fact that there is such a discipline as astrobiology , whose practitioners  task is to imagine what life might be like on other planets.
Yet here on the home planet  we have profoundly strange aliens of our own.
It is in the deepest undersea volcanic vents that we can look back into what life might have been like , at that moment of contamination.
How odd that we see those bizarre creatures of the Stygian depths, with their eerie antennae and sightless eyes, and regard them as alien, when they are, after all, our distant ancestors.
And is it not part of our human hubris that we should presume all aliens to be weird versions of ourselves – somewhat ignoring the wonderful weirdness we ourselves represent?
Hairless apes, pretty much inept at most things, increasingly reliant on the machines we have devised – and which in turn now threaten our own destruction.
In 1896 the American astronomer Percival Lowell hypothesised about  Mars as the abode of life.  He presumed that an advanced civilisation had flourished on Mars, but was dying, despite its desperate attempts to re-engineer its climate by using those canals to tap the planet s polar ice caps for water.
Lowell s vision inspired Wells  nightmare of technologically advanced but rapacious aliens invading Earth to appropriate our resources.
Doubly ironic, then, that we were the real Martians, and that many people – including quite a few scientists – believe that we re accomplishing that same scenario with equal rapacity.
A century after Lowell, James Lovelock s Gaia theory posited that the planet would outlive its human infestation, shrugging it off as a temporary blight like a plague of greenfly, leaving barely a trace of our insignificant sway behind.

If we re all Martians now, who are the aliens?
Facts: Before space exploration, Mars was considered the best candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.
But now we know that the surface of Mars is frigid, dry and windswept and with an atmosphere inhospitable to life as we know it.
If scientists are to discover life on Mars, it could be in a form that they have not yet considered, for example in ice at the poles or in minute traces of water that may still exist somewhere on the planet.
Artist s Conception: Many scientists believe that the channels and gouges on the Martian surface may have been caused by water that once existed on the planet.
8 billion years ago, a time when scientists believe Mars and Earth had parallel evolutionary development, including the elements needed to sustain life: a dense atmosphere, abundant liquid water, and temperatures above freezing.
Although current knowledge suggests that Mars  warm, wet period was too brief to evolve complex life, it is an interesting exercise to speculate on what might have evolved in sustained habitable niches.
Hagen has imagined that Mars  plant and animal ecology developed in the oceans and the wet margins of land, and that the base of the chain of  life on Mars was photosynthesis.
According to Hagen s vision, varieties of zooplankton thrived and provided food for larger and more complex species.
Sponges appeared first with very simple cell types, followed by Martian metazoa that are similar to Earth s jellyfish and anemones.
In this imaginary scenario, creatures evolved and swam the deep subsurface rivers and lakes where liquid water was sustained by geothermal warmth long after it disappeared from the surface.
Alien Weapon Found On Mars?
How can ANY one look at some thing like this and say it is Not artificial in nature?
I wish we could properly determine size, it seems small to me against its back ground.
I am Not in any way convinced it is a weapon.
Though i do Not discount the possibility either.

They Are Among Us.
Conspiracy theorists are excited to announce that they believe they have found something which seems to be an ‘alien thigh bone’ on Mars based on photographs sent back by NASA s Curiosity rover.
The rover’s MastCam captured the bone-shaped object on August 14, leading many to believe that they have found proof that large animals once roamed Mars.
However, more sceptic scientists last year suggested that an asteroid impact that may have killed of the dinosaurs on Earth 66 million years ago could have flung rocks carrying organic matter to the neighboring red planet.

Life s hard when you re not top of the food chain.
The setting is Mars.
The year is 2016.
A rover is searching the planet s surface for traces of life.
Weeks later and millions of miles away on Earth, scientists begin analyzing the data they have received and cannot believe what they see: DNA.
What s more, the DNA belongs to organisms that look like the bacteria found on Earth.
Could this scenario happen in the future?
Twelve spacecraft have already landed or crashed on Mars, possibly carrying microorganisms from Earth.
Although each craft was cleaned before takeoff, the level of cleanliness is now being questioned.
Some microorganisms called extremophiles might survive and grow in extreme, Mars-like conditions -- such as very low-temperature and high-salt environments.
But since many of these microbes were undiscovered until recently, detection and cleaning techniques currently in use may only be spotting and eliminating a fraction of them.
Should these organisms go undetected and survive the trip to Mars, their chance of survival is increased if they encounter water -- although the presence of liquid water on or below the Martian surface today has not been confirmed.
To prevent contamination of Mars and avoid hampering efforts to find life there, NASA should develop over the coming decade new measures to detect and eliminate microorganisms on robotic spacecraft before they leave Earth, says a new report from the National Research Council.
Christopher F.
J.
NASA currently uses procedures that detect heat-resistant and spore-forming bacteria and then attempts to eradicate them by cleaning the spacecraft and, in certain circumstances, baking parts of it with dry heat.
NASA has been developing other methods but greater resources are needed, the report says.
To identify a larger variety of microorganisms, NASA should apply techniques already used by biologists that do not require extra time for culturing the organisms in a laboratory and adapt these methods to provide more accurate estimates of the types and number of microorganisms present on and inside spacecraft and in their assembly areas.
These advanced methods -- which can determine genetic sequences of organisms and link them to known microbial species -- could allow NASA to tailor sterilization techniques toward spacecraft contaminants of greatest concern, the report says.
NASA should investigate and test alternative cleaning methods -- such as radiation or vapor disinfectants -- for their effectiveness in killing different types of microorganisms and for their effects on various spacecraft materials.
If such techniques are fully tested and implemented in time for spacecraft launching in 2016, the scenario described above can be averted.
By preventing the introduction of Earth microbes to Mars, scientists may one day find life forms genuinely native to the red planet.
Once humans set foot there -- as envisioned by NASA s new Vision for Space Exploration -- it will be tougher to avoid contamination.

You might be tempted — I know I would — but emails with these subject lines are probably part of a newly discovered phishing scam, according to Mountain View, California-based security software company Symantec Corporation.
ZIP file allegedly containing the report of the alien discovery, but which actually contains a modification of a known Trojan called DarkMoon.
DarkMoon  also called Poison Ivy  is a common remote-access Trojan  RAT .
RAR attached to the emails.
This file installs the DarkMoon Trojan onto the infected computers, and DarkMoon then creates a backdoor on the computer through which the criminals can remotely access some or all files and processes on the infected computer.
This particular modification of DarkMoon is used by a specific cybercriminal group that Symantec says it s been monitoring, and which has been active since at least mid-2012.
The scam emails pretend to be legitimate by impersonating NASA, according to Symantec.
Presumably, this means the criminals used an email address that might appear at first glance to be an official NASA address, but, typical to phishing campaigns, has one or two letters off.
The emails are also signed with the name of a prominent NASA astronaut.
The scammers behind the emails appear to have only targeted a few companies, mostly in the financial and engineering sectors, which has lead Symantec to classify the scam as a  spear-phishing  attempt.
Spear-phishing is when scammers create emails designed to seem relevant to a very specific group.
Symantec s Lionel Payet said in a company blog post.

It was later covered on a South African TV documentary called Carte Blanche in 2002              and from the exposure here my book The Hidden Records  ref  became a reality.
But there was something else that became clear and there would be no plain sailing forward.
It seems there was something that I released that is still a very protected knowledge by the powers that be in this world.
From this moment onwards my journey could be more likened to the character Langdon in a DaVinci Code novel.
Distributors developed all sorts of bizzare circumstances which set one after the other into meltdom.
Each major didtributor anomaly required moving tons of my books from one distributor to the next.
But it got worse and worse as sabotage and threats occured on a weekly basis for years.
It was more than just a carefully produced glossy paper full colour book that started the book publishing objective.
Regular lucrative publisher offers all had  strange  conditional offers to alter its interpretation to sun worhip and considering turing the Orion aspect backwards and away from Taurus to a worthless planetless star called Sirius.
If agreed it would come with a big money advance.
USA for years.
The correlations are absolutley astounding and size anomalies matches magnitudes of stars.
Take the time to compare the layout pattern of Tikal and Stonehenge with the flash graphic of Mars and compare how all portray the stars of the Pleiades.
This breakthrough was made in early 1998  released in South African newspapers however only published in my book The Hidden Records in 2003.
Update September 2009: The highlight of the Hidden Records book has to be this comparitive measurement  above  between all the stars of the Pleiades and all the anomalies in the Mars cluster in Cydonia.
There are a spectacular 21 correlations for the small stars matching small anomalies.
There are six large magnitude stars correlating with six medium sized anomalies and one primary large star of Alcyone correaling with a another five sided anomaly  like the larger D&M five sided anomaly which still has one equilateral triangle side perfectly intact .
All in all, 28 spectacular correlations where the Mars presentation still has one major piece of evidence that makes it far beyond just coincidence.
Note the parallel fine lines in yellow, the main shape between the cluster forming a trapezium, and a right angled triangle with two 45 degree angles.
But as expected the Pleiades stars are not quite perfectly placed as this.
A documentary titled  Ancient Aliens  on the History Channel 15th March 2009 aired footage of my Mars Pleiades and Tikal starmap findings.
It was used by the main presenter with incorrect graphics and in a way as if it was just  general knowledge .
No references were given at all.
There is a lot more important evidence on hand here with my star map hypothesis that binds many parallel historical mysteries with more clarity.
Another new image of Cydonia that has not been seen before.
It is a composite image of all the latest satellite downloads.
The logic                     and reasoning is sound and tested with scholars in all fields, and I have to respect why only a minority of academics that                     I have pursued have kindly assisted in the evaluation, yet chose                     to remain anonymous due to the earth shattering conclusion.
It is common knowledge that any academic institution of learning                     would need to abide to a strict code of ethics when exploring                     a controversial theory that opposes highly respected previous                     written theory in the university archives.
General evaluation                     would also demand a group consensus which would take a great                     amount of time… years perhaps, for this particular subject                     matter before any comment is officially forthcoming.
One might still wonder if all this research amounts to the                     ultimate collection of coincidences of the century… then                     another hidden anomaly in this image above  in the top left                     hand corner  reveals a shocking new surprise!
You will have to look very carefully in the book for that.
It is there for the reader to figure out.
Other images in the                     book hold all the clues and it is very subtly mentioned in a                     small image caption.
I am saving this for the moment                     academics take me on in a media covered challenge for the truth… as well as a lot more surprising evidence that is saved for                     the sequel which is locked up in a vault and waiting for the                     future.
Only those who have the newly launched book have an                     idea of what is following.
All credits for the sources of the Mars images go to all the                     hardworking NASA teams extracting images from Themis, Observer                     and other satellites orbiting Mars.
Recognition must go to the                     very kind research and science ethics that NASA has made available                     to outside researchers and for the public to explore and publish                     their independent enhancements and interpretations as such.
It is important to mention that the enhancing and processing                     of the images lies within the parameters laid out by                     the ‘outside’ researcher, and is not work instigated                     by NASA itself.
The crop circles in the image above and the video that follows are very advanced, the first of their kind and would appear to be real.
Perhaps watch the 5min video documentary below first then read the story here.
Yes there have been attempts to re-create pixeled faces with lines close to this concept but only possible in just light and dark shade.
These images here are multi shaded.
One appears to be a reply to the 1974 Carl Sagan deep space message from Aricebo.
The coded cipher and face images appeared on the 14th August next to the Chibolton radio telescope in the UK in 2002.
It also had a human face depicted near it in a very special unrecognised way using pixels for the first time ever in crop circles.
See the blurred image beneath the main image above to identify the face.
It could be a man with white beard.
White eyebrows prominent too showing elderly.
There is very slight moustache detail and  goatee  and mouth perhaps slightly open.
This is very important with what follows on the  Solar Deity analysis .
Then exactly a year later, next to another UK radio satellite station in Crabwood Winchester in the Hampshire area 2003 the second special image showing the entity that sent the first message and it was depicting another shocking message.
It used binary code in a disc shape depiction.
Now here is reasoning it is likely it is not a hoax.
The disc the entity is holding in the image below is so precice that its message encryptian in binary cannot be made by human hand.
This is because the excuse of grids of string being used to layout the pattern dont work in circles.
Each tuft of crop left behind is critically sized and positioned.
The message was deciphered by a well known IT specialist and he is seen in the video being interviewed.
Latest research by Martin Keitel updates the message encryption identifying a missing word and showing how some words are in capitals perhaps hiding more of the message.
This crop image was another first of its type ever.
It was made using the same pattern as a TV screen uses and this alone holds a clue.
Seven years have passed and the face has still not been recognised how it fits in the deciphered message.
There is another clue that was missed.
The three stars of Orion are shown in the entity crop image.
The position of the three stars are above the entities shoulder, they are so accurate in detail as one star is slightly offset which is true to Orion s Belt.
I immediately looked for alignment possibilities to match his star map theory.
There is a suggestion of alignment since the three dots are  in line  with the plough troughs!
Here is what is missing in the deciphered messages thus far.
Scientists have wondered if it is an answer to the Aricebo deep space message with us showing who we are and where we come from.
The messages of the two events show who the entity is and his DNA, his planets around another star but no message found so far where the entity COMES FROM.
The human face is undecipherd.
The face is depicted as a Solar deity.
I have presented this a little lower down with the meaning of the Face on Mars.
If it is the symbol showing humanity in the position as it does in the ancient star map hypothesis it is showing the position of the star that is missing so far for this crop mystery.
The second clue in support of the reasoning of the Face depiction as a star coordinate is with the second crop event with the entity.
It has Orions belt encoded with it.
These three stars are in alignment with the  face  star in the ancient star map hypothesis.
Then I suddenly realised the alignment message!
ENTITY ITSELF!
It suggests the entities  star system is also the same star in all the star maps!
See the Solar Sun  god  faces that follow to compare reasoning of the face style and how the face is the  x  that mars the spot in the Mars star map.
If the face on Mars is the  x  that marks the spot, it therefore seems likely that the star maps that I have deciphered are involving perhaps a few planets belonging to the Grey entities.
Now here is a little reasoning behind the  TV line  style in the Alien message.
It is positioned also next to and aligning its edges with a TV research satellite station using this format and not pixels.
TV broadcasts from these entities, near the time of chaos.
The 4 faces in a group in the image above are 4 examples of Solar deities found globally and on Mars.
Note the square head uniqueness in the depictions.
It is a secret symbol of our Star ancestors position in space!
Another interesting finding realised by Martin Kietel is the well known ancient astronaut depiction with flying disc in a cave painting in Uzbekistan.
An entity here seems to be holding the same type of disc with binary detail shown on it!
What are the chances there is a connection here?
The cave depiction shows a being with strange monster face.
Not surprising for an ancient witness seeing monsters in the machine device of the helmet.
Also a cluster of hills pyramids seem clear that are near to a place where many building blocks are strewn everywhere, next to the being holding the disc.
Is it suggesting the  x  monument marking the spot will be excavated and something  alien  will be found beneath it?
Pure speculation by me of course!
No scientist to date has figured a way these particular crop formation images can be created by hoaxers.
I expect that if this story suddenly gets back into the media, some well paid disinformation experts will suddenly appear and claim it was a fake and that they did it.
If this happens such a claim needs proving and they owe it to the public to show how they did the disc creation in absolute dark of night.
Unless someone can firstly claim they did it and secondly recreate it at night then these crop geoglyphs remain acceptable as good evidence they are genuine not of this world creations.
That the message suggests the Greys are also watchers over humanity from this star.
Or something even more important: That the  x  that marks the spot is to reference where the Greys come from too.
The Face image is the  x  that marks the spot in the star maps I have been fortunate to decipher.
A star near the Pleiades with another world in orbit that is their own world.
Latest finding Jan 2010 - Recent soil anomalies show the history behind what was here at Chilbolton before the space radio station.
It was the Chilbolton airbase which was an old airbase in 1944 when the satellite image was taken.
The ideal place for the reply message to that which SETI transmitted!
2009 IMAGE RELEASE  NEW EVIDENCE - MARS FACE IS BUILT FROM STONE BLOCKS!
Mars Face has just been released  image seen above - Jan 2009  with the highest resolution ever and with the correct light angle producing a 3D perspective.
The evidence you are about to explore on this page will no doubt make this website one of the leading research sites on the internet in archaeoastronomy and the subject of the Mars pyramids of Cydonia.
This web page presents in advance of my next new release or ebook, as a preview of all the latest  measurable  findings that authorities are still not prepared to comment on yet.
The findings that follow will convincingly prove that the anomalies on Mars were not only built by advanced life but built perhaps by our very own ancestors.
The most convincing and strongest case, proving the existence of advanced intelligent life on Mars, is right here: The blocks found on the Mars Face  above .
The image here is of the Face of Mars showing various block sand debris patterns, all of which match pyramid ruins in Egypt partially covered by sand.
Story follows .
From the image you will see from the extended lower part of the face, it was once perhaps originally the face of a bearded human.
The case made for the Red Planet once having had advanced intelligent life on it can be further corroborated by what appear to be pyramids on its surface, with their layout plan matching the layout plan of the layouts that all the pyramid civilisations here on Earth are based on, namely a very specific star formation in the night sky.
But the most controversial finding of all has to be what appear to be the remains of a human space helmet.
What is more, it seems to be the same style as that of one used by a prominent secret society here on Earth and that was emulated in one of the most famous space science fiction movies of all time.
The first ever high resolution image of the face on Mars was made available two years ago by NASA JPL through the HIRISE PROJECT at The University of Arizona but the image was so large that computers in 2007 were either unable to complete the download or simply open it before it would crash them.
Since then, the image has been unrecognised for its real value and almost forgotten.
But technology has recently caught up with handling large images, and my two-year project of careful image processing has now been completed.
I started a year ago when his friend Dylan Thorne, who is an IT expert now living in Australia said he would give the download another try.
He succeeded.
The image above  and 4meg image  shows many different block patterns matching pyramid ruins in Egypt covered in The Hidden Records.
When sand forms over collapsed areas of pyramid ruins, very definite patterns are clearly identified.
The Mars face has them all, and it is not surprising since the planet at some point in its history experienced a meteorite impact event that ended it, leaving a 2000 km wide impact crater.
The 2007 image of the Face on Mars made available to researchers was so large that even viewing it in an image window still kept crashing computers.
The image was put on hold for a while.
But while looking at some of features on the image before it crashed I realised a few important facts.
Firstly, I noticed that there were some disappointing digital noise line patterns in a large portion of it, which would need to be painstakingly removed by hand.
Sadly and as was to be expected, the whole image  a black and white gif source  was upside down and at an awkward angle, with poor lighting and poor contrast.
I was absolutely ecstatic at the clear spectacular detail I was seeing for the first time.
I immediately noticed what was clearly a debris field  shaded purple in the image above  revealing that the nose had lost its tip.
There was another matching debris pattern with another important portion on the Mars Face.
It was perhaps the x that marks the spot anomaly in what I am certain was once the small obelisk on the forehead, intended to correlate with a specific star if this is a star map, and which had no doubt collapsed since.
This is a breakthrough on its own since the third eye positioning is part of its message and it matches themes like the greatest ever Egyptian style obelisk ever built in Egypt  as will be explained shortly , and now the scattered material in block form is there to justify it.
The design would match the obelisk Sun Temple in the Egyptian pyramid field.
The importance I explain in my book: The reason the Sphinx has a cobra on its forehead, and the reason other Sun god face monuments found around the world all present the same unusual square looking human face, with mouth poised open and with something in the position of the third eye.
Researches have already suggested the Mars Face experienced at least five direct impacts by meteorites  remains of five craters in shadowed section now very clear .
Also they speak of a large directional planet crust shift, apparently moving suddenly to the right, during what would have been a Mars-quake well above a magnitude 10.
It would have been caused by a massive impact event, which ended all life on it.
Hence the nose and forehead obelisk collapsing in the same direction  shown here by purple shaded areas .
By the way here is where the clearest examples of block debris are exposed!
There are literally millions upon millions of block-shaped rocks everywhere.
Straight edged rocks of linear sizes!
There are three general sizes, the most common size is around 2m to 3m long like the blocks used to build the Giza pyramids in Egypt, followed by extraordinary examples around 5m long, like the blocks of the Sphinx temple in Egypt, and some massive examples more than 10m in length like the blocks found at Baalbek in Lebanon.
In his book published in 2003 I already identified some of the largest blocks, daring to suggest at that time that the Mars face was built of blocks and that the Face on Mars has a very definite left eye.
The time has now arrived demanding a second look, and this time a serious debate is inevitable.
I knew I was able to overcome all the problems in the newly released satellite image where I could digitally overlay shades of appropriate colour found in more recent Mars images for this area.
But for me there was something more valuable that would prove the 3D value of the Mars face seen in some other more recent low resolution images.
For my book I was able to master an art program to bring out the striking detail.
By adding slight colour and by producing an overlay mask sourced from the 20 year old Viking image of the Mars Face, then overlay it onto a 2003 overhead sun shot I had a spectacular end result.
In doing this I produced the first clear image on the face on Mars with the appropriate 3D sun angle interpretation.
This was important because this true  scientifically valid  sun angle shows the 3D nature of the anomaly, but more importantly how a human face would appear in daylight.
So to achieve a scientific comparison to a 3D human face, one would need to compare the effect of natural lighting on a human face with what could be a real human face carving on Mars.
In the image below the source is in black and white and the graphic shows how the image was processed and how the sun angle data altered with overlay processes to match the old Viking image.
The part of the Mars face with the most apparent damage is the area of the lower mouth.
The face most likely originally had an open mouth.
The reasons for this are shared amoungst all ancient civilisations for this depiction of a  Sun god  when depicted as a face.
The lower lip appears to have shifted by the impact event visible on the right hand side of the mouth.
The blast seems to have forced the lower lip further down.
NASA would never ever take this research approach comparing the anomaly with a human face as it would not be in its best interests to try to prove that the anomaly is an ancient monument.
In August 2008 the time arrived when a computer finally succeeded in downloading the very large image with a Coral Photoshop program.
The first thing that I felt urgently needed processing while being in large format, was to eliminate unnecessary excess background to prevent the computer from crashing.
I succeeded.
In so doing this now guaranteed that the work could begin without any more risks of computer crashes.
The image was rotated to the upright face position and more of the background was cropped out, cutting the image down to a workable size of a 70 meg file.
This was followed by a contrast adjustment enhancement simply at the click of a button.
Days were spent removing 70% of the false noise lines.
Now here is where the art program excels.
The secret in enhancing detail without getting pixel noise is as follows: The image was resampled again making the face bigger to 90 megs, but now the face was almost twice the size.
5 pixels softening source pixel edges.
Now all the detail in the whole image was smoother, but edges of everything else more crisp.
It could now be compressed and saved at a rate where block edges are preserved and a workable size of 20 megs.
I spent months on adding approximate colour tones by referencing all the latest source colour satellite images of the Cydonia area against one another.
This was followed by laboriously enhancing every single obvious block shaped anomaly to make his claim clear without distortion.
The process is simple and accurate.
Using the sharpen function as a brush nib, it simply sharpens all chosen detail without altering its source shape.
The example below shows one small portion of the source image and how it was processed.
Note how accurate the enhancement and colouring is when comparing the source against the final version.
The hardest part of all was recreating the Viking original satellite image with perfect 3D light and shadow with an overlay over the the flat image with overhead sun.
The multi overlay masking of adjusted lighter areas and darker areas from the original Viking image is possible without losing the valuable block detail.
5m image in colour will be launched witha future event so the public can view the evidence of the millions of block patterns matching patterns seen on Egyptian pyramids.
Sensational new findings of massive quantities of water on Mars for some unknown reason have been prevented from main news media.
University press releases have made their internet releases known but that is as far as it gets!
The latest findings of 1000 s of kilometers of ice fragments appearing like footage seen of fragmented ice sheets on the sea in the seas around Alaska has now been officially identified.
All that is different to Alaska is that the ice is covered in dust and they are absolutely massive fragments.
Here is the image gallery on the website that has made these images possible.
The mystery behind the giant  splat  craters is no longer a mystery as it seem reasonable to say that some impacts hit a suddenly exposed muddy ocean floor after the cataclysmic primary impact event on Mars.
An impact event that destroyed Mars creating a 2000km wide impact crater called the Hellas Basin.
In the link below see the second image and question the  real  green colour in this colour image, because scientists are saying it is more easily explained as the mineral colour of the surface.
Coincidently, in this area conditions are exceptionally perfect for any algae or moss.
This is the best case so far in questioning the potential of moss or algae!
The ancient lake discovery released June 2009.
Also frozen water permanently available in craters, perhaps of great use to the future mars landing is just as important.
This finding is also not well known and especially surprising since its exciting potential making the Mars trip a lot safer with a smaller water payload demand.
MORE ALGAE OR MOSS UNRECOGNISED ON MARS?
The image below is sourced from ESA Mars Express and it was one taken with special colour sensitive film.
There have been many green images already debunked as mass deposits of gypsum but this one is in an area far from the green deposits.
This one is in an area recognised as having ancient water erosion.
If a cataclysm destroyed all surface vegetation, starting off again from ground zero, it is likely algae would have survived, now forming in the favourable warmer areas and with an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide.
A thin atmosphere would also be no problem for algae.
I simply lightened and enhanced colour in the second image which enhanced the soft shade of green.
The green patches have also formed in a way algae or moss would form on rocks.
A space scientist believes there is now a lot of proof of life on Mars but it is not being released.
Is this the beginning of scientists coming forward?
Lets hope so.
NASA has announced at a press conference that it can confirm a South American astronomer making the claim that massive quantities of methane gas is currently being released on Mars!
NASA probably had the same data for a while from their own research but perhaps felt they were not ready to make the announcement.
How can such an important breakthrough be held back?
If it werent for this astronomer making a claim, nobody would know about it.
The very first Viking landing probe over 20 years ago had a very expensive mini lab to process soil samples looking for carbon to prove life.
BUT while the NASA research team was drinking Champagne, other scientists at NASA tried to disprove the carbon life theory completely.
It is as if they dont want people to think life is or was ever possible on Mars!
The Mars Beagle probe a few years ago also had very expensive equipment on board to detect methane for one reason and for one reason only if it could detect methane it would be able to prove micro biological life on Mars exists.
It apparently didnt work.
Now that the cat is out the bag, scientists seem more interested in disproving the possibility of life on Mars by trying to prove the only other explanation for the methane recent volcanism and surface lava flows something they always insisted previously was absolutely impossible.
They always said Mars was a volcanically extinct planet.
So much so that not only was there no existence of volcanic activity, they insist that the crust is so solid and frozen it was completely without crustal movement.
All the data proved it was not like Earth at all as it is today, with our relatively thin land masses floating on magma.
The methane gas is mainly found around the warmer equatorial areas on Mars so it is more likely to be that discharged by microbial life living in the damp soil around the equator.
Only microbial life can explain these massive quantities of recent methane discharges if it is not volcanic activity.
Volcanic activity would easily be detected in many ways, especially sensors reading infrared radiation.
There have been Mars temperatures across the surface everywhere not much different to the average Canadian winter, and those are the warm readings.
The story has already slipped away into darkness.
The next finding I made now makes a lot more sense algae or moss seen on Mars yet no comments from NASA.
News agencies around the world seem to have avoided using this valuable methane discovery in their bulletins.
See the BBC release 15th Jan 2009.
ANCIENT ARTEFACT - HELMET ON MARS ?
The image that follows is sourced from Spirit Mars rover from NASA and it is of something that creates a whole new conspiracy theory.
The unusual object here is an exact match in detail to something used in the famous Star Wars movie for a  Storm Trooper .
If there is any possible chance that there is a connection here it would have to have the same explanation for the 1958 story that follows here where famous authors like Arthur C.
Clark and many others coincidently knew about the face on Mars by including it in their books many years before any Earth probe was anywhere near Mars.
I am very hesitant in saying that if this is true then there are secret artifacts in store somewhere, perhaps something found in Egypt under the hole in the Sphinx chest area in the late 1800 s that depicts the detail of the star visitors who founded ancient pyramid civilisations.
Mars coincidence.
If the advanced inhabitants on Mars knew a debris field of meteorites was heading their way and they could not evacuate all its world population they would need to prepare its people with protective space suits of some sort.
Those needing evacuation shortly after the cataclysmic event that ended Mars are in question here.
They would have known the atmosphere would be filled with volcanic gas and dust.
They would no doubt build underground protective dwellings too but the need to wear suits something like the proverbial Storm Trooper makes sense, especially body armour if meteor showers were inevitable.
The two small cylinders at the bottom of the helmet would most likely be two small air filters as per our war gas masks.
Their world would have been like a war zone.
If any ancient artefact was ever discovered on Earth and kept secret because it depicted the last people on Mars like storm troopers, it is no wonder at all that the ancients believed Mars was linked to beings revered as gods of war!
October 2006 - Recently scientists released a series of very                   interesting photographs of the face anomaly on Mars.
They inadvertently                   show something critical that was absent in my pyramid                   star map research.
Please note: Those not familiar with my star correlation                   theory on Mars outlined in  The Hidden Records  may find the hypotheses                   that follows hard to follow and might believe this is merely another                   attempt to revive the disputed face anomaly as a face.
The face                   has what scientists jokingly refer to as a horn coming out of                   its forehead.
No wonder the academic world is elated that it is                   exactly what they told us it is: A hill.
For me the new image is having the exact opposite                   effect.
It proves exactly what was missing in  The Hidden Records                    pyramid star map theory.
Three bearded faces found in three different                 continents across the globe seem to speak of each independent civilization s                 genesis.
They all built pyramids and claimed that their ancestors                 came from the heavens.
All have identical beard, forehead and headdress                 themes.
But one of them appears to stand out far more importantly                 than the others.
It is important to bear in mind that I                first published my book in South Africa over two years ago before                 it was officially launched in the USA and UK in May 2006 so no one                 can say I am adjusting my story to suit the new images when you                 read what follows.
During my research before publishing in 2003, when reasoning my                 Mars interpretations I came up with a correlation problem that                 remained inconclusive.
My Egyptian pyramid layout research required pyramid shape                     constructions when interpreting star positions.
If the Mars                     pyramids were real pyramid ruins, why did the face anomaly have                     nothing to do with a form of pyramid interpretation that marks                     the spot like in Egypt?
Why was there no size match for the very small Sun-like star                     I was hoping for as I had found in Egypt?
See pyramid obelisk                     image above .
The first alignment that became apparent to him on Mars was                     to be found in the D&M five-sided pyramid.
Two of this pyramid s                     sides are much longer than the rest  see image below to see                     the resultant alignment line and the Mars star map at the top                     of the page to see the complete line .
Seen from above this                     so-called pyramid creates the effect of an  arrow pointing .
It points to the face anomaly intersecting its central line                     of symmetry in the forehead area  and not at its exact centre,                     which would have made a perfect correlation for the Face monument .
228 of                     the book  and they too landed at the same point on the forehead                     of the face anomaly.
See image below.
When I measured the movement path and the distance of                     the all important correlating Sun-like star  the only star that                     passes through the face position .
It passes precisely through                     the 3 intersecting geometry lines mentioned above, on the forehead.
It does so at a very ancient epoch 17250 years ago and this                     is how I have dated the Mars monuments.
I ascribed these                     correlations and intersections to its builders  recognising                     the significance of the legendary spiritual eye.
274 .
Many might have felt that my esoteric comment here was wishful                     thinking.
Shortly before publishing, I magnified the forehead region                     of the Mars face high resolution image  see book p.
236  and                     saw what appeared to be a round shape, exactly where I was                     looking.
But the likely explanation for this perfectly round                     shape could easily be explained away as an impact crater, so                     I did not feel it was a credible anomaly at all.
In Egypt, the ancients ingeniously found a way to highlight the                 star that was the most important although it was small star.
For                 accuracy purposes it would have to be represented by a small monument,                 but they would have wanted it to stand out nonetheless.
Hence they                 embellished it for grand effect.
They built a giant obelisk ON                 TOP of the smaller pyramid and capped it with gold.
See above                 and see the free article on this website .
Would one not expect                 the same phenomenon for Mars if we dare to consider it was once                 an Earth linked pyramid civilisation before perishing?
The image shown here highlights the coordinates                 from the three pages referred to above and it is depicted here as                 one single overlay over the Mars face  from a statue of Zeus  positioned                 in space where the Sun-like star passes.
The new face  horn  anomaly                 that has come to light in the recent images, by its shape suggests                 very strongly to me that it is this ultimate tiny pyramid correlation                 that I had been searching for.
It is precisely in the position                 it should be in for an exact correlation and its style redolent                 of its Egyptian counterpart, the solar temple with its tall obelisk                 on top of it.
It also falls along the centre line on top of the                 monument.
There are four different lines all intersecting                 at the same point on the forehead of the face ruin anomaly, all                 of which I published in  The Hidden Records  in 2003.
I noticed something                 else since going to print, which could be important in deciphering                 the Mars star map message.
Notice how the star movement path                  yellow  matches the D&M pyramid alignment  red .
On page 236 of  The Hidden Records  I produced                 an updated colour version of the 2002 NASA image and sharpened and                 contrasted it adding its apparent colour for that area  from recent                 surface pigment data .
Image credit as a source goes to NASA here.
Shown below is an extracted piece of the face.
It is a view from                 above with overhead sun angle, hence no shadow is created from the                  new  forehead anomaly.
Demarcated by white cross .
Note how the faint circle  at cross centre  that I thought earlier                 was probably a crater fits into what appears also to be the faint                 outline of a triangular shape.
The shape suggests a partially collapsed                 three-sided pyramid base also having typical pyramid shaped three-edged                 sides before becoming a severely damaged ruin.
Here is another clue: According to the moving                 3D image found at the web link at the top of this article, how is                 it possible for a perfectly round crater to form at the very steep slope angle suggested by these scientists?
An impact should have                 destroyed the  horn  or at the very least have an oval crater.
In all probability it is not a crater.
The  horn  anomaly evidence                 is very unique.
As in Egypt, it can be found in the forehead position                 located in the sacred  all seeing  eye.
It is just like the image                 on the US one dollar bill  and the icon shown here that links                 to what might present its grand secret .
The value of the  all seeing  eye is of paramount importance and                 this website is full of references to it in the Renaissance paintings               that have been posted on it for the past six months.
Here is a rebuild model of what may have been                 on Mars.
I say in this rebuild it was crucial to show the eyes                 intact in defiance of the way the anomaly is being depicted by academics.
Authorities seem quite adamant in their new depiction of the Mars                 anomaly with  unfair  overhead Sun angle and weird colour tones                 and blur that do a splendid job presenting it like a hill.
In Oct 2006 A  New Scientist  media                 release claims an exciting breakthrough that is perhaps more important than the recent frozen ocean discovery: That Mars once had planet-wide                 oceans and was once a blue planet so to speak.
It was announced                 many years ago but  other  scientists found a way to retract the                 statement .
This is important in justifying a large percentage coverage of the planet before it was destroyed my an impact event.
Earth.
How long is it going to be when the full story on Mars gets announced for all to see?

This discovery was made by Streetcap1 of Youtube.
He found some structures on a hill in one of the Mars Curiosity rover photos.
Look at the above photo and pay special attention to the white shiny walls on top of the hill.
The walls are white on one side due to reflection and dark shadowy on the other side due to the suns angle.

According to the fringe sector of the Internet, Mars is practically teeming with aliens.
Since NASA s Curiosity rover touched down on the Red Planet two weeks ago and powered up its cameras, it has already managed to photograph several alleged UFOs and other  anomalies  in the surrounding landscape.
From classic flying saucers to an absurdly out-of-place fossilized human finger, here s a rundown of what UFO believers claim to have found in Curiosity photos so far.
Speculation about Martians in Curiosity s midst got off to a running start when the very first sequence of photos taken by the rover raised questions.
A hazy, distant object mysteriously appeared and then disappeared in consecutive images of the Martian horizon, perplexing even NASA scientists at first.
But the much-discussed  anomaly  turned out not to be a sign of alien activity, but rather the plume of dust kicked up by the sky crane that delivered the rover close to the Martian surface, then veered off and struck the ground some 2,000 feet  600 meters  away.
NASA engineer Steven Sell, sky crane specialist on the Curiosity mission.
In footage posted to YouTube Aug.
18, user  StephenHannardADGUK  applies a series of filters to a Curiosity image of the nearby rim of Gale crater, revealing what he says are four flying saucer -like objects stationed in the sky.
More than 700,000 people have since given the video a gander.
Four objects caught by Mars Curiosity, very difficult to make out on original image so I have used a few filters to highlight,  he said in the video description.  What are these four objects?
UFOs , Dust particles, or something else?
Experts say the four  objects  are actually just dead pixels in the rover s CCD camera — single points in the camera s imager that have lost functionality and register as white.
I fully concur at this point that these are dead pixels on the imager.
Photoshop filtering processes often blend, color-correct or contrast-heighten images in ways that turn single dead pixels into larger, more prominent shapes.
In other words,  using a few filters  is exactly what the YouTube user should not have done in trying to clarify the contents of the Curiosity photo.
In a YouTube video that has racked up more than 400,000 views since it was posted by  ParanormalCollection  on Aug.
7, two small white dots trek across the Martian sky in a time-lapse sequence supposedly shot by one of Curiosity s hazard avoidance cameras and then accidentally  leaked  by NASA.
The footage would be very curious indeed, and deserving of the widespread media attention it has accrued — if it were real, that is.
The images that appear in the footage are in fact the very first ones released by NASA, on Aug.
5, in which the impact cloud from the sky crane can be seen rising like a plume near the horizon.
The difference is that no white dots appear in the original images.
This leaves viewers to contemplate which is more likely: that Curiosity happened to capture UFOs in the very first photos it took of Mars, that NASA removed the UFOs and released the scrubbed photos, then accidentally leaked the originals to  ParanormalCollection  — or that this YouTube user simply took the photos released by NASA, added a sequence of white dots to them in Photoshop, and posted the creation to YouTube?
Curiosity photos.
StephenHannardADGUK, he of dead pixel fame, also stumbled upon a few items that may or may not be leftover props from a David Lynch film miraculously transported to the floor of Mars  Gale Crater.
Hannard wrote in the video description.
When Hannard zooms in on the rocks — which is what we have decided they are — one sees that the finger rock does indeed have a faint, shadowy outline at one end that looks somewhat like a fingernail, and the shoe rock does bear a resemblance to a carelessly overturned sandal.
Likewise, a roughly round rock could be described as a dome-shaped object, and a crevice on another boulder does give it the vague look of a grinning Martian animal.
It s the logical leap of deciding that the rocks might actually be these things that most people don t take.

Retired Soldier Says He Spent 17 Years Battling Aliens on Mars!
Fact.
Add your two cents.
The ex marine, who goes by the name of Captain Kaye, says that there are five human colonies on the Red Planet and he has spent 17 years fighting to protect them.
Serving in a space fleet known as the Earth Defense Force – that recruited military personnel from countries like America, Russia and China – the one-time ex-naval infantryman was trainee to fly a variety of bombers and Star Wars-style space fighters.
He then spent his time protecting the colonies from martians, who presumably wanted to take over and make the planet their own.

The first color snapshot sent by the Opportunity rover shows fine red-gray soil, with lighter circular tracks and drag marks left behind by the rover s airbags.
Hummocky terrain stretches out toward the horizon, and portions of the rover s solar panels can be seen in the foreground.
Jan.
25  — Exactly three weeks after its identical twin set down on Mars, NASA’s Opportunity rover landed late Saturday and sent back pictures of Martian terrain unlike any seen before.
Scientists had expected that Opportunity s landing site would look markedly different from the rock-strewn landscapes that surrounded the Spirit rover as well as the Pathfinder and Viking landers — and they were right.
The first crop of black-and-white pictures showed what appeared to be a plain of dark soil so fine it was imprinted with the trails of the airbags that cushioned Opportunity s landing.
In the distance, blocky slabs of lighter rock poked up through the soil.
I m flabbergasted.
I m astonished.
Steve Squyres, principal investigator for rover science, said early Sunday during a news briefing at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
Squyres said the slabs were  the first bedrock outcrop ever found on Mars,  and he speculated that the rover may have landed within a crater because of the look of the skyline.
The first color image from Opportunity showed that the soil was a dark gray-red, with the airbag imprints showing up in a brighter red.
That  suggests that there may be some kind of layering,  Squyres said.
ET Sunday  in a region known as Meridiani Planum.
If anything, the landing appeared to go even more smoothly than Spirit s Jan.
3 touchdown.
The first bedrock ever seen by a Mars lander is visible in the background of this image, captured by Opportunity s navigation camera.
The rover s mast and solar panels are in the foreground.
Like Spirit, Opportunity had to execute a choreographed sequence of events to ensure its safe arrival on Mars.
Like Spirit, Opportunity was cushioned by airbags inflated during its descent.
But unlike Spirit, Opportunity came down in an Oklahoma-size patch of iron-rich mineral on the opposite side of the planet.
The rover hit the ground with a force estimated to be two to three times Earth’s gravity — far less than the 40 G s it was designed to withstand.
It probably barely noticed it hit anything,” said Chris Jones, director of flight projects at JPL.
NASA received strong signals from the spacecraft even as it was rolling to a stop.

Just after the landing, California Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, NASA Administrator Sean O Keefe and former Vice President Al Gore circulated through the mission control room at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, shaking hands with smiling controllers.
At a jubilant news conference, O’Keefe broke open a bottle of champagne, as he did after Spirit’s landing, and toasted the mission’s leaders.
As the old saying goes, it’s far better to be lucky than good — but you know, the harder we work the luckier we seem to get,” O’Keefe said.
The success provided an extra lift to mission team members who had to deal with their first serious setback earlier this week.
The Spirit rover began malfunctioning Wednesday, after days of sending pictures and other scientific data.
On Saturday, engineers said they were closing in on the problem, although it could take days or weeks more to get Spirit moving again.
Rover project manager Peter Theisinger upgraded Spirit s  medical  condition from critical to serious.
Ed Weiler, NASA s associate administrator for space science, observed during the news conference.
NASA sent Spirit to Gusev Crater, a broad depression believed to once have contained a lake.
Opportunity s new home, Meridiani Planum, is a flat, smooth region that abounds in a type of iron oxide mineral called gray hematite, which typically forms in marine or volcanic environments rich in water.
Gray hematite could provide new clues in the search for evidence that Mars could have supported life millions or billions of years ago.
Some of the environmental conditions that can produce gray hematite, such as a lake or hot springs, would be hospitable to life.
Others, such as hot lava, would not.
Gusev Crater.
That s the whole issue.

For all of you who long to believe there s intelligent life on Mars, NASA s curiosity rover has some evidence that s hard to overlook.
An astounding video, uploaded to YouTube on Oct.
19, seems to show a  lion s den  on Mars , complete with cubs, watched over by wary adults looking straight into the camera of the NASA Curiosity rover.
It s either the real thing, or the strangest case of pareidolia ever discovered.
Either way, the amazing video gives even the hardest skeptic pause, despite the overwhelming evidence that any form of life on Mars is impossible.
The author of the video, a woman using the name Nature s Lullaby, begins with a mini tutorial for navigating the raw feed website NASA manages, posting thousands of images taken by the rover for more than a year.
The photos are then minutely scrutinized by a cadre of UFO and alien hunters looking to find the first, indisputable evidence of life off the Earth.
As the author scrolls down the page, she chooses one recent day of images and opens up the photo to its highest resolution.
At first glance, the image doesn t appear any different than hundreds of others just like it.
It s only by magnifying the photo that the startling imagery is defined, which does indeed look like a pride of lions looking out from their den, clawed out from the surrounding rock face.
Of course, such a thing shouldn t be possible.
The atmosphere of Mars cannot sustain human life, much less a thriving lion pride.
But the possibility these are fossilized remains is an intriguing matter for debate.
Is it possible Mars once hosted the kind of diverse wildlife only, so far, found on Earth?
Could a pride of lions have existed on the planet at some point in the distant past?
Are these the remains, literally carved in stone, of the last denizens of what was once a rich biosphere on Earth s closest neighbor?
The unusual video joins the parade of recent stories claiming various oddities, filmed by NASA rovers and planetary orbiters, are similar to objects and lifeforms found on Earth, including the latest, the discovery of a petroglyph similar to those found in ancient ruins on this planet.
Whether this video shows actual evidence of a planet teeming with life, even to the level of sustaining an entire pride of lions, in Mars  distant past, will be difficult to prove.
The author herself raises the possibility that the rover is not even on Mars, but transmitting photos of a remote desert region right here on Earth, implying NASA may be engaged in a massive cover-up to fool the world.
What do you think?
Is this evidence that Mars once had lions?
Or is it just another interesting pile of rocks?
Is the Curiosity rover actually on Mars?
Or is NASA hoodwinking the public?

According to plenty of NASA watchers on the web, it s possible.
In the latest round of photos published by the space agency to the Internet, one picture caught the attention of the eagle-eyed public dedicated to poring over every pixel downloaded from the rover carefully making its way across the Martian landscape.
Peeking out from the rocky, desert soil is a distinctive and familiar  looking shape.
It resembles the fossilized remains of a lizard-like sea  creature with an elongated, twisting spine, much like those of reptilian   dinosaurs  found all over archaeological digs explored on Earth for  the last several centuries.
Right down to the tail.
It would appear that life had evolved in a similar manner as to Earth.
Would that imply a same source of seeding of life or given the properties and materials in this solar system this is the path life takes.
If it is very similar to Earth it might be making a large statement about the beginnings of life here.
Instead of fossils on Mars it s probably just another NASA hoax.
Earth.
Could be another NASA  Oooopsie  moment.
Watch for the NASA images to start getting Photoshopped again.
I think those look as much like vertebrae of large sea animals as anything could.
For one thing I do not see how wind erosion of rocks would possibly make a row of similarly shaped formations like that.
The thing that I completely fail to understand is the mentality by a lot of people that life on any planet but Earth is not only totally and completely impossible but also absolutely unacceptable.
We should be able to learn from history that a mentality like that of refusing to accept even the possibility of a new and previously unknown reality only holds back our progress as a civilization.

That being said, according to Graz Hancock life came from Mars, to Earth possibly Or that Planet X Nibiru destroyed what was then Tiamat and is now Mars.
NASA Spirit Rover took a sequence of five images over an approximate seven day period that showed what appears to be an animal near a distinctive set of rocks.
Two of the five images show an object that appears where other images in the sequence show nothing else was previously there.
The object, about the same size as a basketball, had clearly moved, not once but several times in the sequence.
The object appears to have a relatively long neck and blends in well with the surrounding rocks.
Spirit Rover had captured images of an indigenous form of Martian life that blends in well with the surrounding rocks.
It’s pretty hard to ignore NASA’s own imagery that clearly shows a basketball sized object appearing to move on the Martian surface.
So why hasn’t NASA said anything about it?
I thought I would give someone from NASA a chance to respond.
The five images from the Spirit Rover mission show an object that has clearly moved in the sequence.
The object appears to be some kind of animal that blends in well with the surrounding rock.
Given that NASA experts refuse to discuss such a  Hard evidence has been found that there is some kind of indigenous life roaming the surface of Mars.
