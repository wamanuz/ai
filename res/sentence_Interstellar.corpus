Promising outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick s “2001: A Space Odyssey,” Interstellar.


Chris Nolan’s Interstellar isn’t just a movie about a small group of astronauts attempting to save the world.
The best case scenario, and this isn’t a prediction per-se, is that Interstellar performs like, you guessed it, Inception.
But come what may, it’s tough to see a situation where Interstellar makes less than $150m domestic and $415m worldwide, which would be the break-even point for the $165m production.
Enough of Interstellar is thoughtful, engaging, and visually dynamic that it feels almost petty to acknowledge that the picture doesn’t quite hold together as a movie.
Nolan is capable of and in terms of the film viewed in a relative vacuum, Interstellar is not quite a success.
The plot of Interstellar, and I’ll try not to reveal anything not in the first and second trailers, involves an Earth on the verge of extinction after what amounts to a second “Dust Bowl” that decimates the world’s agriculture.
If Inception works as a parable for the film-making process itself and The Dark Knight Rises operates as a metaphor for  Chris Nolan wanting to break free of the comic book superhero genre , then one could easily read Interstellar as a rallying cry for Hollywood to, to quote Nolan’s last original creation, “dream a little bigger.
When the focus is on the core tragedy, that of a loving father potentially leaving his children forever with no guarantee that his sacrifice won’t be in vain or that he won’t merely save the generation after them, Interstellar occasionally qualifies as a gut-punch.
It is a film about interstellar travel that is ironically at its strongest when it remains Earthbound.
Good is not the enemy of perfect, but Interstellar is not good enough.
Mendelson liked Gravity and Contact more than Interstellar, that is still his subjective opinion.
I love the premise of Interstellar, but reading that the movie “rushes into space only to slow to a relative crawl once it gets there” kills my enthusiasm for it.
Preoccupied with nothing less than the notion that humankind will one day need to migrate from Earth to some other planet we can call home, Interstellar so bulges with ideas, ambitions, theories, melodrama, technical wizardry, wondrous imagery and core emotions that it was almost inevitable that some of it would stick while other stuff would fall to the floor.
But aside from 2001, which is obliquely referenced again in a late-on cutaway to an ancient Cooper lying in bed in a sterile room, the landmark sci-fi film that Interstellar intriguingly echoes is the 1956 Forbidden Planet; both involve a follow-up journey to a planet in a different galaxy where humans have previously landed and intensely dwell upon a father-daughter relationship.
For all its adventurous and far-seeing aspects, Interstellar remains rather too rooted in Earthly emotions and scientific reality to truly soar and venture into the unknown, the truly dangerous.
Matthew McConaughey leads an all-star cast in  Interstellar.
While it reaches for the stars, director Christopher Nolan s Interstellar is a flawed masterpiece.
Last year s Gravity touched on similar turf, but Interstellar blows the concept out in more complex — though sometimes more tedious — fashion.
Though its heart and mind are in the right place, for a space epic aiming for profound resonance, Interstellar falls short.
Plot Summary:  Interstellar  chronicles the adventures of a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.
From the opening scenes of sprawling cornfields accompanied by a revelrie-like brass note, it’s clear that Interstellar is working in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Directed by Christopher Nolan  Memento, Inception, the most recent Batman trilogy  and written with his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan, Interstellar takes place in a near future that harkens back to the recent past — like the 1950s Midwest or maybe the Dust Bowl, but with laptops and drones.
The movie is most powerful when it’s at its least abstract — when it’s working through the messy decisions and sacrifices that actual interstellar travel would entail, finding dramatic potential in the laws of physics.
Christopher Nolan s Interstellar is the last big blockbuster of the year.
As in 2001,  Grierson s review reads,  Interstellar portrays space as an airless, silent sea that’s both gorgeous and terrifying.
This is but one allusion to Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece: Interstellar also slyly references that film’s music and visual cues, and even a plot point.
At its core, Interstellar is a quintessentially Christopher Nolan film.
It’ll be fairly easy to pull the tread that unravels the science, but if you give yourself over to suspension of disbelief, then Interstellar has the potential to propel you on an engaging and emotionally resonant path; replete with moments that will leave the viewer breathless.
One thing that may surprise audiences is that Interstellar is also often quite funny.
Openly borrowing from 2001, Close Encounters, and other films of that era, Interstellar has a hook that will be easy for both Hollywood and moviegoers alike to get behind.
Ultimately, Interstellar is an entertaining, if wonky, science fiction yarn that is as visually spectacular as an audience would hope for, expect, and demand of Nolan.
Though, as mentioned, Interstellar also has the potential to become a highly divisive film.

In that respect, “Interstellar” may represent an apotheosis of sorts, as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director.
Nolan is, presumably, among a handful of filmmakers who gets to do whatever he wants with minimal studio intrusion, but the resolution of “Interstellar” feels so inorganic that you d swear it was concocted by a Glendale focus group.
Until it s not that anymore, and “Interstellar” becomes thuddingly prosaic.
Nolan also seemingly can t help himself from drowning out many of the dialogue scenes with ribcage-jiggling bass notes from pipe organs and string sections, which basically try to do for “Interstellar” what “bwaaaaahhh” did for “Inception.
Christopher Nolan s movies are usually cold and clever in equal doses, but  Interstellar  shakes up that pattern: A genuinely moving spectacle about the perils of discovery and survival, Nolan s science fiction odyssey applies the same degree of intellect to its borderline corny plot as it does to the physics-heavy backdrop.
Despite narrative details that might require a science degree for full comprehension, the actual premise of  Interstellar  is relatively straightforward: In a near future where Earth s ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet s farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind.
While his three Batman movies obscured that talent,  Interstellar  allows it to shine where it belongs — in a narrative practically designed for tricky logic.
Even as the story barrels ahead into extrasolar environments made of ice, giant waves, the pratfalls of wormholes and gravitational singularities,  Interstellar  bolsters its plot to genuine character motivation and the continuing impression that everything adds up to…something.
Co-written with his brother Jonathan and consultation from theoretical physicist Kip Thorne,  Interstellar  eventually finds Cooper and his colleagues in a distant solar system on the brink of a black hole, which means that time gets funky: Visiting one planet, they lose decades of Earth time over the course of a disastrous three-hour trip — which means that, once back on the ship, Cooper must get caught up on years of messages from his family back home.
Aided by Hans Zimmer s energizing score — a far more colorful effort than the intentionally abrasive ones found in earlier Nolan collaborations— Interstellar  is Nolan s most well-rounded movie to date.
Despite its epic scope,  Interstellar  delivers a traditional payoff.
For a movie with such a spectacular plot,  Interstellar  strains from such elementary moments  look out for the hints of a romantic subplot that never goes anywhere, maybe because the filmmakers just lost interest after a while .
Outside of those virtues,  Interstellar  still delivers in purely visceral terms, with Nolan s attention to scale always in play.
Still,  Interstellar  is held together by McConaughey s credible turn, which has more in common with his subdued role on  True Detective  than his usual snarky routine.
Their formidable performances ground  Interstellar  in a plot that, without such credible elements in play, might seem more at home on  The Twilight Zone.
Instead,  Interstellar  makes its far-reaching concept utterly believable, right down to an outrageous climax that stretches across time and space with bursts of psychedelic imagery that still winds up making sense.
In its final scenes,  Interstellar  struggles to bring every piece in play to a tidy conclusion, but it s comforting to watch Nolan give it a shot.
The timing of  Interstellar  caps a great period of science fiction cinema.
The past 12 months have seen the release of not only  Gravity  but also the hard science travelogue  The Europa Report   which in retrospect plays like  Interstellar -lite  as well as the multidimensional dinner party comedy  Coherence,  which also uses real physics in the service of outrageous entertainment.
Brainy and exciting at the same time,  Interstellar  invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product.
Even by his standards, Interstellar is a wild leap of faith: an epic of science fiction which puts equal stress    on both words.
Unlike Inception, whose puzzle-box games with time felt like a bedazzling    gimmick, Interstellar mines the same ideas with a much more deep-digging    intelligence, as the primary condition behind everything we know of the    universe.
Early in Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” NASA-pilot-turned-farmer Coop  Matthew McConaughey  has to make a choice: Take part in a secret, last-ditch, one-way space launch that might find humanity a home other than the dying, desolate, used-up Earth … or stay and care for his son and daughter, still in their childhood.
It’s a piece of advice that seems to have gone unheard by the makers of “Interstellar,” even as they wrote it.
Promising outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick s “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Interstellar” instead plays like a confused mix of daringly unique space-travel footage like you’ve never seen and droningly familiar emotional and plot beats that you’ve seen all too many times before.
Set in a near-future—after the food riots, but there are still product placements for Dodge trucks and Carhartt clothing—“Interstellar” begins as Coop’s daughter Murph  Mackenzie Foy  is convinced she has a ghost in her room, one that moves objects and knocks down knick-knacks.
When the advanced beings pulling the strings in “Interstellar” finally intervene directly in Coop’s life and times, it feels less like cosmic strangeness than it does convenient sentimentality.
After all the jaw-dropping cinematography and carefully-buffed CGI, in fact,  Interstellar  winds up fitting into a fairly narrow and deeply tired sub-genre alongside films like  Frequency,   Contact,  and even  Field of Dreams : Dad Issues from Dimension X.
It s impossible to not admire the technical achievements of  Interstellar,  but as Michael Bay and so much more modern moviegoing has proved, rapturous visuals can t make up for a ruptured script.
Christopher Nolan s  Interstellar  spends hundreds of millions to take the audience on a journey to the farthest parts of the cosmos .
Christopher Nolan s space epic  Interstellar  is still a month away from theaters, but the final trailer is out now and to say it is amazing is an understatement of, well, interstellar proportions.
In   Interstellar ,  Earth has run out of food, and a team of astronauts — including Matthew McConaughey as engineer-pilot  Cooper  — has to leave the planet to hunt for an alien world that humans could call home.

It disguises itself in science, but ‘Interstellar’ isn’t really about science.
There’s a lot more Emotion in ‘Interstellar’ than I expected -- its core foundation, really -- but there’s almost too much going on in ‘Interstellar’ to the point that, at times, in retrospect, nothing is really happening even though it kind of seemed like something was happening.
Until it s not that anymore, and “Interstellar” becomes thuddingly prosaic.
In its final scenes,  Interstellar  struggles to bring every piece in play to a tidy conclusion, but it s comforting to watch Nolan give it a shot.
It works both inside the ships and outside, and there s a lot of  Interstellar,  particularly in 70MM IMAX, that is just jaw-dropping.

The first round of reviews are now in for Christopher Nolan’s apocalyptic space and time-travel epic Interstellar, and they are decidedly mixed.
Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.
Already by this point — and we have not yet left the Earth’s surface —  Interstellar   which Nolan co-wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator, Jonathan  has hurled a fair amount of theoretical physics at the audience, including discussions of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space.
Some sections drag, and perhaps unavoidably, since Interstellar s length is key to its essence.
Brainy and exciting at the same time,  Interstellar  invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product.
In that respect,  Interstellar  may represent an apotheosis of sorts, as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director.
Nolan is, presumably, among a handful of filmmakers who gets to do whatever he wants with minimal studio intrusion, but the resolution of  Interstellar  feels so inorganic and milquetoast that you d swear it was concocted by a Glendale focus group.
Co-written by Nolan  with his brother, Jonathan  and inspired by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne’s work on traversable wormholes, Interstellar only really gets going once it’s up in the air.
And this brings us to ‘Interstellar,’ a movie filled with so much scientific jargon that it does a pretty good job hiding how absurd some of the movie can be.
There’s a lot of exposition in ‘Interstellar.
For all its adventurous and far-seeing aspects, Interstellar remains rather too rooted in Earthly emotions and scientific reality to truly soar and venture into the unknown, the truly dangerous.
Explore a universe of fan-generated solar systems and black holes in the Interstellar experience.
Snow, man … Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar.
JFK would doubtless approve of Christopher Nolan’s grand space opera, Interstellar – well, the subject matter, at least.
Co-written by Nolan  with his brother, Jonathan  and inspired by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne’s work on traversable wormholes , Interstellar only really gets going once it’s up in the air.
Obviously that wasn’t the case as the Stanley Kubrick classic is regarded almost as a religious experience for its zealots, and I have no doubt that the powerful, moving and thought-provoking Interstellar just might be regarded in that same league decades from now.
That element should play well with the Academy, which never has given a so-called “Science Fiction Film” the Best Picture Oscar  though 2013’s Gravity, to which Interstellar will be compared, came tantalizingly close, winning seven Oscars and Best Director only to lose the big one in the end to 12 Years A Slave .
Critics and a handful of cranky pundits aside, I can tell you the industry so far seems to be blown away by Interstellar.
It’s intriguing, but I saw Interstellar, so …” — meaning what chance could he, or anyone else, possibly have?
To be sure Interstellar offers reigning Best Actor winner McConaughey his richest, most heroic and perhaps most emotional role ever — even more so, believe it or not, than Dallas Buyers Club.
As the Interstellar rollout continues during the next couple of weeks, more of this story will be told, and its awards prospects will take shape.
Still, Interstellar was good and a sight to see especially in IMAX.
I’m overjoyed about the reaction to the premiere of “Interstellar” and its Oscar possibilities.
Did you not know that even now you are In an interstellar conveyance !
It was a pleasure working my ass off  making great sets and special effects gizmos for Interstellar.
Deep, deep into the 169-minute running time of ‘ Interstellar ’ is a scene in which astronaut pilot Cooper   Matthew McConaughey   must dock a spaceship with another, larger, out of control spinning space ship.
This is also an apt description of the style of ‘Interstellar’ director, Christopher Nolan .
And this brings us to ‘Interstellar,’ a movie filled with so much scientific jargon that it does a pretty good job hiding how absurd some of the movie can be.
There’s a lot of exposition in ‘Interstellar.
There are effects in ‘Interstellar’ that made me almost audibly gasp, then there are other effects where it looked like maybe the budget ran out.
It’s a profound message: ‘Interstellar’ is about saving humanity, despite humanity.
It disguises itself in science, but ‘Interstellar’ isn’t really about science.
There’s a lot more Emotion in ‘Interstellar’ than I expected – its core foundation, really – but there’s almost too much going on in ‘Interstellar’ to the point that, at times, in retrospect, nothing is really happening even though it kind of seemed like something was happening.
Basically, there’s an actor in ‘Interstellar” playing the Steve Buscemi role from ‘Armageddon’ – the crazy guy who screws everything up.
Up until this point, everything was so nuanced and so interesting, then it was decided that ‘Interstellar’ just had to have a head butting, rocket boosting intergalactic fistfight.
I actively hated ‘Interstellar’ throughout this entire sequence.
That sentence is going to read as churlish, but I do admire ‘Interstellar’ for at least attempting to be something that’s not dumb.
And ‘Interstellar’ is ambitious, even though there are a lot of head-scratching scenes.

It s the year s biggest mystery, but Christopher Nolan s Interstellar will soon be launched upon an unsuspecting world.
Check back tomorrow for more Interstellar exclusives.
Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.
Yet still ‘Interstellar’ inspires trust, and all the formulae and ample talk of wormholes is best taken as mood music.
Also, despite the cosmic canvas, ‘Interstellar’ is still one of the most earthbound films to date from Nolan, and the one most in tune with its emotions.
But where ‘Interstellar’ is more Spielberg than Kubrick is in the strained family relationships at its heart.
It s fair to say that Interstellar , the hotly anticipated science fiction film from director Christopher Nolan, is his darkest, slowest-moving and most uncompromising work yet.
This isn t to say Interstellar is a bad movie; far from it.
You ve got something close to the experience of the end of Interstellar.
In Interstellar, it is suggested that those three planets in the other galaxy may be imperfect versions of Earth —  but that the rump of humanity needs to go there anyway, if only to use them as stepping stones to our next world.

Christopher Nolan’s latest film, Interstellar , is not just one of the most anticipated movies arriving in Fall 2014 , but  for many cinephiles  one of the most talked about titles of 2014.
The first wave of Interstellar reviews have hit the ‘Net, so we’ve gone and rounded up several excerpts from them, below – but don’t worry, they’re all SPOILER-FREE.
It s] an enormous undertaking that, like all the director’s best work, manages to feel handcrafted and intensely personal, “Interstellar” reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place alongside “The Wizard of Oz,” “2001,” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “Gravity” in the canon of Hollywood’s visionary sci-fi head trips.
THR -  so bulges with ideas, ambitions, theories, melodrama, technical wizardry, wondrous imagery and core emotions that it was almost inevitable that some of it would stick while other stuff would fall to the floor.
In that respect, “Interstellar” may represent an apotheosis of sorts, as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director.
On the plus side, there’s a stunning portrayal of how far-reaching space travel might work, a glimpse at an apocalyptic near-future that’s both brilliantly written  designed  and a vision of robots like nothing I’ve ever seen in a movie…  the resolution of “Interstellar” feels so inorganic and milquetoast that you’d swear it was concocted by a Glendale focus group.
If good intentions were enough to make a movie a masterpiece, Interstellar would be the greatest work of Nolan’s career.
That said, even with its many flaws, Interstellar is an often gorgeous, expertly put-together movie that demands to be seen on the biggest possible screen.
And while many parts of Interstellar don’t work, the whole hangs together enough to be a movie that impresses with hard sci-fi nerdiness.
Coming Soon - “Interstellar” is another one of Christopher Nolan’s more personal mind-f*ck movies… While it may not be as immediate as “Inception” and it wears most of its most obvious influences on its sleeve, it’s still very much the type of intelligent spin on a specific genre we’ve come to expect from the filmmaker…  Christopher Nolan’s love letter to space travel and the exploration of the stars may require some patience, both with its pace and your own capability of understanding complex time space theories, but it offers an incredible emotional payoff along with its visual spectacle.
Time Out - Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.
In summation, Interstellar has thus far earned much in the way of critical acclaim for its ambitious ideas, as well as  the scientific research  that informs its world-building and plot.
However, given the amount of envelope pushing, it comes as little surprise that Interstellar  according to the early reviews  can be messy at times – before it concludes with some third-act developments that feel less than innovative, compared to what came before.
Truth be told, Interstellar sounds like Inception – big ideas wrapped around a simpler personal story.
Difference is, Inception also has the entertainment value of an exciting heist thriller to offer, whereas Interstellar clearly resembles Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey not just thematically, but also in terms of that film’s slow and steady pacing.
That said, just about everyone so far seems to agree that Interstellar is worth seeing in the biggest format possible, for the visuals alone.
And if Interstellar is good, I will always trust Nolan.
For the record, this isn’t to say that Interstellar is guaranteed to be good, no movie is.
Wanting to see Interstellar is not snobbism.
In many ways, Interstellar is that story that we only glimpsed at from Nolan.
I really don’t get why people expect the next 2001 A Space Odyssey with Interstellar.
I hope Interstellar is the movie where he gets both sides the story and the presentation perfectly right, like in the Dark Knight.
Predictable isnt a word wed expect to be uttered within 10 miles of a Christopher Nolan movie - and yet its painfully necessarily in discussion of Interstellar, Nolans aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama that is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution.
To help tell the story of Interstellar, Nolan once again enlists a large cast of both big name stars and talented character actors, and all perform admirably  though one clearly sticks out above all others.
There is no question that Interstellar delivers in terms of spectacle, as the movie is immersive, scattered with gorgeous photography, and demands to be shown on the biggest screen imaginable.

Hit the jump for the Interstellar review roundup.
But even a Nolan failure is more interesting than lots of filmmaker’s successes, and Interstellar definitely sounds worth a look.
But even those critics will agree that Interstellar is a film not to be missed in its theatrical run – the movie must be experienced in a big theater, projected in 70mm or on an IMAX film screen if possible.
Predictable” isn’t a word we’d expect to be uttered within 10 miles of a Christopher Nolan movie – and yet it’s painfully necessarily in discussion of Interstellar, Nolan’s aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama that is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution.
Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.


The enigma that is the space odyssey “ Interstellar ” will get solved when the film hits theaters in November, but until then, Christopher Nolan has revealed a few clues.
Unlike his “Dark Knight” trilogy, Nolan insists that “Interstellar” can be experienced on its own, independently of the characters.
Well, something like that might be happening with another movie,  Interstellar,  opening on November 7.
This is the first we’ve heard anything about Interstellar involving climate change, but gives some insight into the scene setup the reporter goes on to detail.

Ahead of the release of Christopher Nolan’s hotly anticipated space movie Interstellar, the film-makers reveal how theoretical physicist Kip Thorne helped them to create scientifically accurate special effects for a black hole.

Along comes Interstellar, an exhilarating science fiction creation that once again reminds us that we can dream, that we get to breathe this fresh air on this beautiful planet, that we get to smile, cry and laugh.
For me, it s all about the feelings, the exhilaration, which is achieved through technical mastery and storytelling genius, and with Interstellar we get the very rare, immaculate balance of both.
Set in the not-too-distant future, Interstellar is almost Nolan s attempt at a re-envisioned modern version of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Yes, Christopher Nolan goes that far with Interstellar.
Within Interstellar, the experience of Gravity is just one scene inside a much bigger story; Nolan takes us on an Apollo program -inspired journey that is truly breathtaking and mesmerizing to behold.
After this first viewing  and I can t wait for my next one  my honest feeling is that the first half has a few minor speed-bumps before launching into the phenomenal second half, which is where the entire experience expands our horizons towards the greatest possibilities of interstellar exploration, for the most part, and what s out there.
Coming in just 11 minutes shy of three hours, Interstellar does run very long and has a few snags along the way but builds to a conclusion that makes us contemplate our potential in this universe.
More than anything, Interstellar is an emotional movie, crafted with emotion  Christopher Nolan and his wife, producer Emma Thomas, have four children together  and designed to pack an emotional punch.
One of my favorites is David Gyasi as  Romilly , another astronaut who joins Cooper and the crew on the interstellar voyage.
If I speak honestly, there s so much I want to openly discuss about Interstellar but must hold back in order to prevent spoiling the experience.
Not to give away anything big, but aside from an interstellar voyage, this movie has wormholes, black holes, robots, spaceships, astronauts, rockets, drones, NASA, sleep chambers, and some other tricks up its sleeve.
Aside from being an ambitious, heartfelt story about exploring our place beyond this Earth, Interstellar also seems like an amalgamation of many of iconic sci-fi films of past: 2001: A Space Odyssey, A.
Speaking of, one of the other invigorating powers of Interstellar is how much it can inspire us to dream through the visuals alone.
The power of Interstellar is in its ability to create and encourage discussion about the universe we re in, and other ambitious topics like our place in the universe, how science can enable us to progress forward as the human race  beyond planet Earth , and how it might involve something more than science to pull that off.
In the 24 hours since first screening Interstellar, I ve already had at least two if not three passionate debates with friends about the movie and key parts of its plot.
My favorite part about reviews of films like Interstellar is when critics assume no one looks up at the stars and dreams anymore.
So you think Cloud Atlas, which you gave a 10 10, is a better movie than Interstellar?
Does that mean it is a better film that Interstellar?
Where maybe Interstellar is just a little clunky at points.
It s usually the films that are so hyped up  like Interstellar, Avatar, Cloud Atlas etc  that ends up being mixed or falls short of expectations.
If Interstellar is just as entertaining and interesting on that level, or even higher, then I would say Nolan succeeded and continues his streak on making original stories that Hollywood needs to do more of.
Im hoping that i will like Interstellar more than the Prestige.
Space epic  Interstellar  takes place on a troubled Earth, where dwindling food supplies are forcing humankind to consider the possibilities available to them beyond Earth s boundaries.
As humanity faces the prospect of imminent starvation, a loving father of two  Matthew McConaughey  is convinced to take part in an interstellar mission along with a team of intrepid explorers, all hoping to find solutions to the crisis beyond the solar system.

With Christopher Nolan’s forthcoming film Interstellar, the director of The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception boldly goes into outer space with his most visually spectacular and emotionally resonant movie yet.
And yet, Interstellar deliberately veers away from dystopia chic with its depiction of optimistic, adventurous heroism reminiscent of director Philip Kaufmann’s adaptation of The Right Stuff, which not only influenced the tone of Nolan’s movie but the techniques he used to make it.
Informed by the work and theories of renowned astrophysicist Kip Thorne, Interstellar is more akin to the speculative sci-fi of 2001: A Space Odyssey than space opera fantasy like Star Wars, while still remaining accessible pop entertainment.
Nolan challenged himself and his team to fill Interstellar with imagery designed to inspire awe in the audience, not to mention a little terror.
You might want to watch Interstellar on an IMAX screen, especially since Nolan incorporated more than an hour of footage shot using IMAX cameras.
I mean it in the way, say, Treasure of the Sierra Madre is about dramatizing ideas of human nature,” says Nolan, who wrote the script with his brother, Jonathan, and produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, who has produced all of his movies.

But how does this fall s sci-fi epic Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan hold up under a microscope  no pun intended ?
The research was based off of existing trailers, and more to the point, PopSci says that Interstellar s real-world theoretical physicist flat-out refused to speak with its writers.

One of the most intriguing aspects of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar is that every time we see a new piece of marketing for the film, we end up with more questions than answers.
Such savvy campaigning led us to select Interstellar as our third most anticipated movie of the fall , along with the fact it’s Nolan’s follow-up to the Dark Knight trilogy, starring Matthew McConaughey, in his first film of 2014, after owning 2013.
We expect answers  and astonishment  when Interstellar opens November 7.
Kip Thorne’s concept for a black hole in Interstellar.
While he was working on the film Interstellar, executive producer Kip Thorne was tasked with creating the black hole that would be central to the plot.
To begin with wormholes at the center of a spinning black hole are a convenience theory for interstellar space travel.
There’s been talk of Interstellar being an Oscar contender and while there is high praise for the film all-around, it also seems as though “hokey contrivances” and “a ruptured script” could keep it from earning Nolan his first Academy Award win, or another nomination for that matter.

The Guardian said Interstellar was  a glorious spectacle but a slight drama .
Scott Foundas, chief critic of Hollywood bible Variety , was fulsome in his praise, describing Interstellar as  an exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan s vast imagination .
Meanwhile, writing in the Daily Mail , Brian Viner said Nolan had made  an intellectually-stimulating sci-fi film , although he  felt at times during Interstellar that he might have boldly gone for a stimulus too far .

KSP Interstellar is a plugin for Kerbal Space Program, designed to encourage bootstrapping toward ever more advanced levels of technology as well as utilising In-Situ resources to expand the reach of Kerbal civilisation.
The principal goal of KSP Interstellar is to expand Kerbal Space Program with interesting technologies and to provide a logical and compelling technological progression beginning with technologies that could have been available in the 1970s 1980s, then technologies that could be available within the next few years, progressing to technologies that may not be available for many decades, all the way out to speculative technologies that are physically reasonably but may or may not ever be realisable in practise.
Rebranded to KSP Interstellar -Beta phase begins -Warp Drive, Antimatter Collector, Science lab Models added -Warp Animation and Sound -New parts  2 more warp drives, computer core  -Space solar parts now animate according to their function  Receivers deploy when they are receiving some power, Transmitters deploy when activated  -New resource handler - should result in much better performance all round, especially at high timewarp speeds -Resource prioritisation prevents you have to turn off generators to power engines -Plasma thruster now scales its thrust depending upon how many plasma thrusters are attached and active -Plasma thruster default propellant is now LiquidFuel, can also use Argon or Xenon  LiquidFuel is best for Isp, Xenon best for thrust, Argon in the middle  -Upgrades added for warp drive, antimatter reactors and thermal turbojet -Thermal turbojet can now use stock Air Intakes for propellant as well as my Atmospheric Intakes -Warp Drives now use ExoticMatter, generated by power, rather than by acting as a huge battery for Megajoules -Fixed Warp Vector persistence bug, should again be safe to activate the warp drive, leave the game and then deactivate the warp drive when you next return.
In November, Christopher Nolenâ€™s movie â€œ Interstellar â€� will hit theaters and, last week, a very atmospheric teaser trailer has shown us what to expect.
But by introducing a wormhole, Nolen has pulled a sci-fi trick to sidestep the problem of traversing vast interstellar distances to an alien planet.

What’s interesting is how much the black hole in Interstellar looks like the models that the scientists of the Event Horizon Telescope  EHT  have generated to study the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*.
In other words, the black hole in Interstellar is really, truly what scientists expect real-life astrophysical black holes to look like.
So when you watch Interstellar, keep this in mind: that black hole Matthew McConaughey flies through?
A spacesuited Matthew McConaughey is revealed in a new trailer for Christopher Nolan s  Interstellar.
The mission of the  Interstellar  spaceship Endurance is clear — space exploration — at least based on its newly-revealed mission patch.

Short of the one-sentence summary,  Group of astronauts travel through a wormhole,  little was known about Interstellar, Christopher Nolan s blockbuster sci-fi film.
Based on a script co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, Interstellar began shooting in August 2013 and was shot in Canada, Iceland and Los Angeles before wrapping up last December.
With the release of the first trailer, Interstellar shouldn t stray too far from the filmmaker s secretive game plan.

What is the Interstellar Medium?
Simply put, the interstellar medium is the material which fills the space between the stars.
Although the interstellar regions are more devoid of matter than any vacuum artificially created on earth, there is matter in space.
In total, approximately 15% of the visible matter in the Milky Way is composed of interstellar gas and dust.
Approximately 99% of the interstellar medium is composed of interstellar gas, and of its mass, about 75% is in the form of hydrogen  either molecular or atomic , with the remaining 25% as helium.
The interstellar gas consists partly of neutral atoms and molecules , as well as charged particles, such as ions and electrons .
Even though the interstellar gas is very dilute, the amount of matter adds up over the vast distances between the stars.
Therefore, less of the blue light reaches us, which means that the light that reaches us is more red than it would have been without the interstellar dust.
This effect is known as interstellar reddening .
To see an explanation of extinction and interstellar reddening that is more mathematical, please visit this site .

So when we found out director Christopher Nolan was making Interstellar , we couldn’t resist.
Without further navel-gazing, we present the science of Interstellar.
Coming to an IMAX theater near you and everyone else, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar will have a record debut in the large-screen format.
Between this and digital-only theater owners’ ire about Interstellar premiering early on film, IMAX might not be the most well-liked format in the distribution game right now, but at least it’s still the most expensive for moviegoers.

The depressing answer in every study so far is that interstellar travel is centuries away.
He looks at the energy budget of interstellar missions.
We also know that amino acids are common in interstellar space.

Why InterStellar ?
A few reasons why Interstellar rocks : theme options, responsive design, portfolio section, widgetized homepage, easy to customize !
Matthew McConaughey speaks during an interview with Reuters at an advanced screening of the film Interstellar in Fort Hood, Texas October 18, 2014.
From winning his best actor Oscar in March for  Dallas Buyers Club  to his lead role in the highly anticipated space-exploration drama  Interstellar,  set to become one of the year s biggest movies, McConaughey has rocketed to a level of stardom unlike anything he said he has ever experienced before.
McConaughey, 44, takes the lead in  Interstellar,  out in theaters on Nov.
His decision to star in  Interstellar  was inspired by his oldest, 6-year-old Levi, who wants to invent a spacesuit that will let him walk on the sun.
In November, Hamilton returns to the big screen in the Warner Bros and Paramount Pictures movie “INTERSTELLAR”, directed by Christopher Nolan.
Time plays a critical role in the film INTERSTELLAR.
From acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan  “The Dark Knight” films, “Inception” , “Interstellar” stars Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey  “Dallas Buyers Club” , Oscar winner Anne Hathaway  “Les Miserables” , Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain  “Zero Dark Thirty” , Bill Irwin  “Rachel Getting Married” , Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn  “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” , and Oscar winner Michael Caine  “The Cider House Rules” .
Emma Thomas, Christopher Nolan and Lynda Obst produced “Interstellar,” with Jordan Goldberg, Jake Myers, Kip Thorne and Thomas Tull serving as executive producers.
Pictures and Paramount Pictures present, in association with Legendary Pictures, a Syncopy Lynda Obst Productions production, a film by Christopher Nolan, “Interstellar.
This is the UNIQUE Hamilton watch developed hand in hand with the INTERSTELLAR production team exclusively for the film.
And so the visceral reaction I had to the teaser trailer for Nolan’s upcoming Interstellar was totally unexpected.
The best stories are the simplest, and behind the set and setting of Interstellar we find the outlines of an archetypical hero’s journey—at least, we see the outlines of its first act.
There are strains of Odysseus woven through McConaughey’s Coop, just as Interstellar echoes strains of Homer’s Odyssey, though he leaves behind a daughter named Murphy instead of a son named Telemachus  in the leaked draft of the script floating around the Internet,  Murphy  is a boy, not a girl .
The Earth of Interstellar cannot sustain us, and perhaps it does not even want us anymore.
Behind the Interstellar teaser and trailer lurks the press of that desire—the need to see for ourselves and conquer the overwhelming, threatening, tantalizing unknown.
In the small glimpse of Interstellar we’ve been shown, McConaughey’s Coop leaves his uncaring kingdom to his child, and though he may not be the driving force behind the mission to explore beyond the wormhole, he is its catalyst.
A newly discovered wormhole paves the way for mankind to embark on an interstellar journey that surpasses any voyage ever attempted.
Upon discovery, a team of explorers and scientists are assembled in an effort to use the wormhole to conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.
