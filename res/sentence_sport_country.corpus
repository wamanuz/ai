I was hoping for an apple pie type of scent but what I picked up from Country Weekend was a strongly spicy which was low on sweetness and unnoticeable on the note of apple.

What s the Most Dominant Country In Each Winter Olympic Sport?
As Olympstats detailed Tuesday morning , while other nations have had memorable Olympiads, with some even sweeping an entire category, no country since the 1970s has reeled in medals at such a high rate, and no country has ever come close to doing so over so many events.
For example, Finland s cross-country team won two-thirds of the medals in 1952, but in less than half the number of races.
Other countries have been able to control certain Olympic sports in particular years, but we wanted to examine the longer view and see which countries tend to dominate a sport over multiple Winter Games — even over multiple decades.
To see which nations have the tightest grip on their favorite events, we looked at all the medals handed out in each of 11 Winter Olympic sports from 1980 to 2014, and compared that to the number of medals won by one country s athletes within those sports.
The resulting winning percentage shows how many medals that country has won out of the total number available.
For example, while speed skating has long been the Netherlands  strongest sport, they haven t always been as dominant as they ve been in 2014.
Also of note: Canada has won 33 percent of all curling medals since the sport was introduced in 1998.
Since each nation is only allowed one team, that s arguably the most impressive of all, but we left the sport out of this measure for comparison s sake.
Wine Country Motor Sports was started in March of 1992 in Sonoma, California at what is now the Raceway at Sonoma.
Maybe as an outcome of that, and doubtlessly it is one of many reasons, there is greater interest in sport now than ever before.
A far more important reason though is the growth in television and more sophisticated packaging and indeed, a more wired generation that sees the best in sport from around the world.
It is a benefit, and a challenge, to Indian sport as I suspect the new football league  the Indian Super League, ISL  is going to discover.
More people than ever before are watching sport but more critically, they are supporting teams as well.
As team loyalties grow, and as sport is placed in a context, the need to watch the very best, while still important, no longer becomes the only reason to watch sport.

The most difficult sport of all.
Because of this, the sport requires extreme amounts of stamina and talent to play, and to be successful, it requires even more effort.
Cross country consists of long races  minimum 5k or 3.
Cross country is not to be confused with indoor outdoor track.
Although they have long-distance events, their longest usually is 5k, cross country s shortest.
Road races aren t technically true cross country races, but usually get grouped together with cross country races because of their distance and hills.
A true cross country race stays away from pavement as much as possible.
To succeed in cross country, a couple things are neccessary.
If running 5+ miles a day doesn t sound like a good workout, you d better try a less-taxing sport.
Cross country is cool in that it can be both an individual and team sport.
They make fun of us for wearing short shorts, they say our sport is primitive and requires no talent, ect.
A sport which is superior to every other sport, because you need talent, and endurance to stand up to the challenge.
Cross country is better than field hockey because field hockey is for talentless ho s.
Wow that cross country 5k race was hard!
Those cross country guys ran 10 miles!
Champions challenge their limits - cross country runners always challenge their limits.

I am from the United States of America and my favorite sport is basketball.
My second favorite sport is football.
Lacrosse has been tagged as “the fastest game on two feet” and those “feet” are rapidly moving across the country.
Colleges and High Schools are now adding Lacrosse to their athletic repertoire as the sport gains attention in areas that knew little if anything about the game in the past.
In 2000 there were 1,273 programs across the country.
In 2007 there were a recorded number of 2612 Boy’s High School Lacrosse Programs across the country.
Below is a map showing the locations of the 2007 programs across the country.
It is highly probable that in another 7 years the heat will spread throughout the country as new programs spring up in areas other than the Northeast.
This is a dramatic increase and illustrates how non-traditional hotbeds are discovering the sport and expanding it’s presence rapidly.
Colleges and Universities are creating programs across the country which are attracting growing number of players to their schools.
Below are two maps that show the growth of NCAA Division 3 Men’s Lacrosse Programs across the country.
Started in 2001 the league contains 10 teams all throughout the country.
This has helped pushed the popularity of the sport by showcasing it’s top players.
There are tons of kids screaming out for a fun sport they can pick up and run with and lets face it, time has weathered football into perfection and boredom.
Will see the same decline in numbers as any other mature sport.

For example we have institutions called country clubs.
Inner city kids  mostly black and Latino  will never have the opportunity to go to a country club and take golf lessons like suburban  mostly white and Asian  kids will.
It is true that inner city kids sometimes have some exposure to these  country club  sports, however there is not enough of an interest by the kids or adults to make progress in those sport programs.
Kids either play a sport like basketball, work, or get into trouble.
We think that if there were more of an interest and opportunity for these  country club  sport programs for inner city kids, they would have a greater opportunity to excel and use this as a ticket to continue their education.
Even if they are not able to use a sport to get out of their neighborhood, at least they would be spending their free time in a healthy way and not getting into trouble with gangs, drugs, or criminal activities.
We have seen a few examples of how minority kids with the right effort and constant persistence of a dream and encouragement by parents can succeed in  country club  sports.
Once he became a part of the upper class, he then could gain membership to country clubs and partake in the sport of golf.
Because of this Michael Jordan example, we argue that other minorities could do well in  country club  sports.
His family was there for him and encouraged him to continue participating in the sport.
The important thing we need to focus on now since Tiger Woods has become such a superstar, is what good will he do for other minority kids trying to break into country club sports.
Will they give back to the community and encourage other inner city kids to take a serious interest in their sport?
We are not suggesting that these athletes mentioned should start opening up businesses in inner cities, but we think if they used their name and implemented programs where kids could learn these  country club  sports which the athletes participate in, it would be very beneficial for the youth.
Hopefully programs sponsored by athletes like the ones mentioned would promote more interest in the  country club  sports.
Kids of color are untapped resources in  country club  sports.

Besides the international sports that are practiced in the Basque Country today, the Basques have also developed several unique sports that are still very popular.
But in addition to these international sports, there are several games that have originated in the Basque Country and are still played today.

Josphat Nyataya, co-captain of Team Kenya from Nakuru town and a rock-solid handler, “loved the sport at first sight.
Due to its accessibility, ultimate is a perfect sport for low-income places like Kenya.
In a country where the average annual income is $862, this is a very important point.
Since he started playing ultimate three years ago, “I have met many new friends both in Kenya and outside the country.
It really fascinated me at first that the sport could be played without a referee, with just the spirit of the game.
As Clement points out, “Our country’s major undoing has been opposing political stances that fuel ethnic animosity.
Josphat sees the potential for societal benefit if the sport grows: “The Kisumu team has players from at least six different tribes despite the fact that Kisumu is predominantly Luo.
If the game can be publicized to become a major sport like football, it might help change the tribal dynamics in the country.
Kenyan players have never played elsewhere so they’ve never had direct exposure to the broader sport.
It is critical for them be able to see all of this at WCBU 2015 so that they can bring it all back to Kenya and sow the seeds for real grassroots development of the sport in Kenya.
I have never played Ultimate, but I have been a huge fan ever since my daughters took up the sport in high school.
