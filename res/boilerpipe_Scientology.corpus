This article is about the belief system and practices.
For the organization, see Church of Scientology .
The Scientology symbol is composed of the letter S, which stands for Scientology, and the ARC and KRC triangles , two important concepts in Scientology.
Scientology teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature.
9] Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counselling known as auditing , in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience painful or traumatic events in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.
10] Study materials and auditing sessions are made available to members on a fee-for-service basis, which the church describes as a  fixed donation .
11]  Scientology is legally recognized as a tax-exempt religion in the United States , Italy ,   South Africa ,  Australia ,  Sweden ,  the Netherlands ,  New Zealand ,   Portugal ,  and Spain ;      the Church of Scientology emphasizes this as proof that it is a bona fide religion.
27] In contrast, the organization is considered a commercial enterprise in Switzerland , a cult  secte  in France and Chile , and a non-profit in Norway , and its legal classification is often a point of contention.
A large number of organizations overseeing the application of Scientology have been established,  the most notable of these being the Church of Scientology.
Scientology sponsors a variety of social-service programs.
28]  These include the Narconon anti-drug program, the Criminon prison rehabilitation program, the Study Tech education methodology, the Volunteer Ministers , the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises , and a set of moral guidelines expressed in a booklet called The Way to Happiness .
Scientology is one of the most controversial new religious movements to have arisen in the 20th century.
The church is often characterized as a cult , and it has faced harsh scrutiny for many of its practices, which, critics contend, include brainwashing and routinely defrauding its members,  as well as attacking its critics and perceived enemies with psychological abuse, character assassination, and costly lawsuits.
12]   In response, Scientologists have argued that theirs is a genuine religious movement that has been misrepresented, maligned, and persecuted.
34] The Church of Scientology has consistently used litigation against its critics, and its aggressiveness in pursuing its foes has been condemned as harassment.
35]  Further controversy has focused on Scientology s belief that souls   thetans   reincarnate and have lived on other planets before living on Earth  and that some of the related teachings are not revealed to practitioners until they have paid thousands of dollars to the Church of Scientology.
38]  Another controversial belief held by Scientologists is that the practice of psychiatry is destructive and abusive and must be abolished.
The word Scientology is a pairing of the Latin word scientia   knowledge ,  skill  , which comes from the verb scīre   to know  , and the Greek λόγος lógos   word  or  account   .
42]  Scientology, as coined by L.
Ron Hubbard, comes from the Latin scio, which means  knowing, in the fullest meaning of the word  and the Greek word logos, which means  study of .
In 1901, Allen Upward coined Scientology  as a disparaging term, to indicate a blind, unthinking acceptance of scientific doctrine  according to the Internet Sacred Text Archive as quoted in the preface to Forgotten Books  recent edition of Upward s book, The New Word: On the meaning of the word Idealist.
45] Continuing to quote, the publisher writes  I m not aware of any evidence that Hubbard knew of this fairly obscure book.   In 1934, philosopher Anastasius Nordenholz published a book that used the term to mean  science of science .
47] It is also uncertain whether Hubbard was aware of this prior usage of the word.
L.
Scientology was developed by L.
Ron Hubbard as a successor to his earlier self-help system, Dianetics .
Dianetics uses a counseling technique known as auditing, to enable conscious recall of traumatic events in an individual s past.
49] It was originally intended to be a new psychotherapy and was not expected to become the foundation for a new religion.
50]  Hubbard variously defined Dianetics as a spiritual healing technology and an organized science of thought.
52] The stated intent of Dianetics is to free individuals of the influence of past traumas by systematic exposure and removal of the engrams these events have left behind, in a process called clearing.
Hubbard, an American writer of pulp fiction , especially science fiction ,  first published his ideas on the human mind in the Explorers Club Journal and the May 1950 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine.
54] The publication of Dianetics in May 1950 is considered by Scientologists a seminal event of the century.
55] Two of Hubbard s key supporters at the time were John W.
Astounding Science Fiction, and Dr.
Joseph A.
Winter .
Winter, hoping to have Dianetics accepted in the medical community, submitted papers outlining the principles and methodology of Dianetic therapy to the Journal of the American Medical Association and the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1949, but these were rejected.
May 1950 saw the publication of Hubbard s Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health .
His book entered the New York Times best-seller list on June 18 and stayed there until December 24 of that year.
58] Dianetics appealed to a broad range of people who used instructions from the book and applied the method to each other, becoming practitioners themselves.
54]  Hubbard found himself the leader of a growing Dianetics movement.
54] He became a popular lecturer and established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey , where he trained his first Dianetics counselors or auditors.
Rutgers scholar Beryl Satter says that  there was little that was original in Hubbard s approach  with much of the theory having origins in popular conceptions of psychology.
60] Satter observes that,  keeping with the typical 1950s distrust of emotion, Hubbard promised that Dianetic treatment would tap dangerous emotions in order to release and erase them, thereby leaving individuals with increased powers of rationality.   Hubbard s thought was parallel with the trend of humanist psychology at that time, which also came about in the 1950s.
60] Passas and Castillo write that the appeal of Dianetics was based on its consistency with prevailing values.
Dianetics soon met with criticism.
Morris Fishbein , the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association and well-known at the time as a debunker of quack medicine , dismissed Hubbard s book.
62] An article in Newsweek stated that  the dianetics concept is unscientific and unworthy of discussion or review .
63] In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for teaching medicine without a license, which eventually led to that foundation s bankruptcy.
Some practitioners of Dianetics reported experiences which they believed had occurred in past lives, or previous incarnations.
59] In early 1951, reincarnation became a subject of intense debate within Dianetics.
67] Campbell and Winter, who was still hopeful of winning support for Dianetics from the medical community, championed a resolution to ban the topic.
67] But Hubbard decided to take the reports of past life events seriously and postulated the existence of the thetan , a concept similar to the soul .
59] This was an important factor in the transition from secular Dianetics to the more supernaturalistic Scientology, but more to the point, Hubbard saw that Dianetics was about to fail from its inherent individualism which set each person as his own authority.
It has been suggested that Hubbard started the more religious mode of Scientology to establish an overarching authority—his own.
Also in 1951, Hubbard introduced the electropsychometer   E-meter for short , a kind of galvanometer , as an auditing aid.
67] Based on a design by Hubbard, the device is held by Scientologists to be a useful tool in detecting changes in a person s state of mind.
Publishers Weekly gave a plaque posthumously to L.
Ron Hubbard commemorating the appearance of Dianetics on its bestseller list for one hundred consecutive weeks.
One scholar has called Dianetics the bestselling non-Christian religious book of the century.
The 1950 book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health has influenced Scientologists so much that they use a  dating system based on the initial appearance of this book. For example,  A.D. 25  does not stand for Anno Domini, but  After Dianetics.    Scholarly conjecture discusses the likelihood of the Church of Scientology falsifying the numbers of Dianetics books sold; the Church says more than 90 million.
Nevertheless, the book has seen very little attention from scholars.
In 1952, Hubbard built on the existing framework set forth in Dianetics, and published a new set of teachings as Scientology, a religious philosophy.
70] In December 1953, Hubbard incorporated three churches – a  Church of American Science , a  Church of Scientology  and a  Church of Spiritual Engineering  – in Camden, New Jersey .
71] On February 18, 1954, with Hubbard s blessing, some of his followers set up the first local Church of Scientology, the Church of Scientology of California, adopting the  aims, purposes, principles and creed of the Church of American Science, as founded by L. Ron Hubbard.    The movement spread quickly through the United States and to other English-speaking countries such as Britain, Ireland, South Africa and Australia.
73] The second local Church of Scientology to be set up, after the one in California, was in Auckland, New Zealand .
C.
59] In 1957, the Church of Scientology of California was granted tax-exempt status by the United States Internal Revenue Service  IRS , and so, for a time, were other local churches.
62]  In 1958 however, the IRS started a review of the appropriateness of this status.
62] In 1959, Hubbard moved to England, remaining there until the mid-1960s.
The Church experienced further challenges.
The United States Food and Drug Administration  FDA  began an investigation concerning the claims the Church of Scientology made in connection with its E-meters.
62] On January 4, 1963, they raided offices of the Church of Scientology and seized hundreds of E-meters as illegal medical devices.
The devices have since been required to carry a disclaimer saying that they are a purely religious artifact.
In the mid-sixties, the Church of Scientology was banned in several Australian states, starting with Victoria in 1965.
76] The ban was based on the Anderson Report , which found that the auditing process involved  command  hypnosis, in which the hypnotist assumes  positive authoritative control  over the patient.
Many scientology techniques are in fact hypnotic techniques, and Hubbard has not changed their nature by changing their names.
The Australian Church was forced to operate under the name of the  Church of the New Faith  as a result, the name and practice of Scientology having become illegal in the relevant states.
76] Several years of court proceedings aimed at overturning the ban followed.
In the course of developing Scientology, Hubbard presented rapidly changing teachings that some have seen as often self-contradictory.
78]  According to Lindholm, for the inner cadre of Scientologists in that period, involvement depended not so much on belief in a particular doctrine but on unquestioning faith in Hubbard.
78] In 1966, Hubbard stepped down as executive director of Scientology to devote himself to research and writing.
59]  The following year, he formed the Sea Organization or Sea Org , which was to develop into an elite group within Scientology.
59]  The Sea Org was based on three ships, the Diana, the Athena, and the Apollo, which served as the flag ship.
81] One month after the establishment of the Sea Org, Hubbard announced that he had made a breakthrough discovery, the result of which were the  OT III  materials purporting to provide a method for overcoming factors inhibiting spiritual progress.
81] These materials were first disseminated on the ships, and then propagated by Sea Org members reassigned to staff Advanced Organizations on land.
In 1967, the IRS removed Scientology s tax-exempt status, asserting that its activities were commercial and operated for the benefit of Hubbard, rather than for charitable or religious purposes.
74] The decision resulted in a process of litigation that would be settled in the Church s favor a quarter of a century later, the longest case of litigation in IRS history.
In 1979, as a result of FBI raids during Operation Snow White , eleven senior people in the church s Guardian s Office were convicted of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property.
In 1981, Scientology took the German government to court for the first time.
On January 1, 1982, Scientology established the Religious Technology Center  RTC  to oversee and ensure the standard application of Scientology technology.
On November 11, 1982, the Free Zone was established by former top Scientologists in disagreement with RTC.
84] The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and believes that the Church of Scientology has departed from its original philosophy.
In 1983, in a unanimous decision, the High Court of Australia recognized Scientology as a religion in Australia, overturning restrictions that had limited activities of the church after the Anderson Report.
On January 24, 1986, L.
Ron Hubbard died at his ranch in Creston, California ,  and David Miscavige became the head of the organization.
Starting in 1991, persons connected with Scientology filed fifty lawsuits against the Cult Awareness Network  CAN , a group that had been critical of Scientology.
88] Although many of the suits were dismissed, one of the suits filed against the Cult Awareness Network resulted in $2 million in losses for the network.
88] Consequently, the organization was forced to go bankrupt.
88] In 1996, Steven L.
Hayes, a Scientologist, purchased the bankrupt Cult Awareness Network s logo and appurtenances.
88]  A new Cult Awareness Network was set up with Scientology backing, which operates as an information and networking center for non-traditional religions, referring callers to academics and other experts.
S.
Church of Scientology against Steven Fishman, a former member of the Church, Fishman made a court declaration which included several dozen pages of formerly secret esoterica detailing aspects of Scientologist cosmogony .
92] As a result of the litigation, this material, normally strictly safeguarded and used only in Scientology s more advanced  OT levels , found its way onto the Internet.
92] This resulted in a battle between the Church of Scientology and its online critics over the right to disclose this material, or safeguard its confidentiality.
92] The Church of Scientology was forced to issue a press release acknowledging the existence of this cosmogony, rather than allow its critics  to distort and misuse this information for their own purposes.   Even so, the material, notably the story of Xenu , has since been widely disseminated and used to caricature Scientology, despite the Church s vigorous program of copyright litigation.
In 2005, the Church of Scientology stated its worldwide membership to be eight million, although that number included people who took only the introductory course and did not continue on.
5 million members in the United States,  but a 2001 survey conducted by the City University of New York found only 55,000 people in the United States who claimed to be Scientologists.
Europe, South Africa and Australia.
95] In 2008, the American Religious Identification Survey found that the number of American Scientologists had dropped to 25,000.
Scientologists tend to disparage general religious surveys on the grounds that many members maintaining cultural and social ties to other religious groups will, when asked their religion, answer with their traditional and more socially acceptable affiliation.
The Church of Scientology claims to be the fastest growing religious movement on earth.
97] On the other hand, religious scholar J.
Gordon Melton has said that the church s estimates of its membership numbers are significantly exaggerated.
98] In the UK scientology is declining.
Scientology beliefs revolve around the thetan, the individualized expression of the cosmic source, or life force, named after the Greek letter theta  θ .
101]   The thetan is the true identity of a person – an intrinsically good, omniscient, non-material core capable of unlimited creativity.
In the primordial past, thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure.
101] The universe has no independent reality, but derives its apparent reality from the fact that most thetans agree it exists.
102] Thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation, rather than their original state of spiritual purity.
101] Eventually they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers.
As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.
Thetans are reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called  assumption  which is analogous to reincarnation .
101] Like Hinduism , Scientology posits a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one s present life, and with each rebirth, the effects of the MEST universe  MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time  on the thetan become stronger.
Scientology presents two major divisions of the mind.
105] The reactive mind is thought to absorb all pain and emotional trauma, while the analytical mind is a rational mechanism which is responsible for consciousness.
102]  The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical  conscious  mind; these are referred to as engrams.
107] Engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity.
101] To avoid this fate is Scientology s basic goal.
101] Dianetic auditing is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the Clear state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind s engrams, and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan.
Scientology uses an emotional classification system called the tone scale.
108] The tone scale is a tool used in counseling; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person s place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering his or her condition.
The Scientology symbol is composed of the letter S, which stands for Scientology, and the ARC and KRC triangles, two important concepts in Scientology.
Scientology emphasizes the importance of survival, which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as dynamics.
110]  An individual s desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family.
110]  The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and the Infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being.
110] The optimum solution to any problem is held to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics.
Scientology teaches that spiritual progress requires and enables the attainment of high ethical standards.
113] In Scientology, rationality is stressed over morality.
113] Actions are considered ethical if they promote survival across all eight dynamics, thus benefiting the greatest number of people or things possible while harming the fewest.
The ARC and KRC triangles are concept maps which show a relationship between three concepts to form another concept.
These two triangles are present in the Scientology symbol.
The lower triangle, the ARC triangle, is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for.
101] It encompasses Affinity  affection, love or liking , Reality  consensual reality  and Communication  the exchange of ideas .
101] Scientologists believe that improving one of the three aspects of the triangle  increases the level  of the other two, but Communication is held to be the most important.
115] The upper triangle is the KRC triangle, the letters KRC positing a similar relationship between Knowledge, Responsibility and Control.
Among Scientologists, the letters ARC are used as an affectionate greeting in personal communication, for example at the end of a letter.
117] Social problems are ascribed to breakdowns in ARC – in other words, a lack of agreement on reality, a failure to communicate effectively, or a failure to develop affinity.
118] These can take the form of overts – harmful acts against another, either intentionally or by omission – which are usually followed by withholds – efforts to conceal the wrongdoing, which further increase the level of tension in the relationship.
While Scientology states that many social problems are the unintentional results of people s imperfections, it asserts that there are also truly malevolent individuals.
118] Hubbard believed that approximately 80 percent of all people are what he called social personalities – people who welcome and contribute to the welfare of others.
118] The remaining 20 percent of the population, Hubbard thought, were suppressive persons.
5 percent of this 20 percent are hopelessly antisocial personalities; these make up the small proportion of truly dangerous individuals in humanity:  the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords.    Scientologists believe that any contact with suppressive or antisocial individuals has an adverse effect on one s spiritual condition, necessitating disconnection.
In Scientology, defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons,     and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors.
125] A Scientologist who is actively in communication with a suppressive person and as a result shows signs of antisocial behaviour is referred to as a Potential Trouble Source.
Scientology asserts that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized.
128] It is believed that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as auditing .
129] Through auditing, it is said that people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams.
95] This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be at cause in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams.
130] Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of Preclear to Clear and Operating Thetan.
131] Scientology s utopian aim is to  clear the planet , a world in which everyone has cleared themselves of their engrams.
Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or auditor.
133] It bears a superficial similarity to confession or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice the way a pastor or priest might do.
133] Instead, the auditor s task is to help a person discover and understand engrams, and their limiting effects, for him- or herself.
133] Most auditing requires an E-meter , a device that measures minute changes in electrical resistance through the body when a person holds electrodes  metal  cans  , and a small current is passed through them.
Scientology asserts that watching for changes in the E-meter s display helps locate engrams.
133] Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it, in order to help him or her eliminate the engram, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the engram s  charge  has been dissipated and the engram has in fact been cleared.
133] As the individual progresses, the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity.
133] At the more advanced OT auditing levels, Scientologists perform solo auditing sessions, acting as their own auditors.
Seeking spiritual development within Scientology is undertaken by studying Scientology materials.
Scientology materials  called Technology or Tech in Scientology jargon   are structured in sequential levels  or gradients , so that easier steps are taken first and greater complexities are handled at the appropriate time.
This process is sometimes referred to as moving along the   Bridge to Total Freedom  , or simply  the Bridge .
115] It has two sides: training and processing.
113] Training means education in the principles and practices of auditing.
113] Processing is personal development through participation in auditing sessions.
The Church of Scientology believes in the principle of reciprocity, involving give-and-take in every human transaction.
12] Accordingly, members are required to make donations for study courses and auditing as they move up the Bridge, the amounts increasing as higher levels are reached.
12] Participation in higher-level courses on the Bridge may cost several thousand dollars, and Scientologists usually move up the Bridge at a rate governed by their income.
These are the OT levels, the levels above Clear, whose contents are guarded within Scientology.
The OT level teachings include accounts of various cosmic catastrophes that befell the thetans.
134] Hubbard described these early events collectively as   space opera  .
In the OT levels, Hubbard explains how to reverse the effects of past-life trauma patterns that supposedly extend millions of years into the past.
135] Among these advanced teachings is the story of Xenu  sometimes Xemu , introduced as the tyrant ruler of the   Galactic Confederacy  .
According to this story, 75 million years ago Xenu brought billions of people to Earth in spacecraft resembling Douglas DC-8 airliners, stacked them around volcanoes and detonated hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes.
The thetans then clustered together, stuck to the bodies of the living, and continue to do this today.
Scientologists at advanced levels place considerable emphasis on isolating body thetans and neutralizing their ill effects.
The material contained in the OT levels has been characterized as bad science fiction by critics, while others claim it bears structural similarities to gnostic thought and ancient Hindu beliefs of creation and cosmic struggle.
134]  Melton suggests that these elements of the OT levels may never have been intended as descriptions of historical events and that, like other religious mythology, they may have their truth in the realities of the body and mind which they symbolize.
134] He adds that on whatever level Scientologists might have received this mythology, they seem to have found it useful in their spiritual quest.
Excerpts and descriptions of OT materials were published online by a former member in 1995 and then circulated in mainstream media.
This occurred after the teachings were submitted as evidence in court cases involving Scientology, thus becoming a matter of public record.
135]  There are eight publicly known OT levels, OT I to VIII.
139] The highest level, OT VIII, is disclosed only at sea on the Scientology cruise ship Freewinds .
139] It has been rumored that additional OT levels, said to be based on material written by Hubbard long ago, will be released at some appropriate point in the future.
A large Church of Spiritual Technology symbol carved into the ground at Scientology s Trementina Base is visible from the air.
In Scientology, ceremonies for events such as weddings, child naming, and funerals are observed.
101] Friday services are held to commemorate the completion of a person s religious services during the prior week.
101] Ordained Scientology ministers may perform such rites.
101] However, these services and the clergy who perform them play only a minor role in Scientologists  religious lives.
The general orientation of Hubbard s philosophy owes much to Will Durant , author of the popular 1926 classic The Story of Philosophy ; Dianetics is dedicated to Durant.
144] Hubbard s view of a mechanically functioning mind in particular finds close parallels in Durant s work on Spinoza .
Sigmund Freud  s psychology, popularized in the 1930s and 1940s, was a key contributor to the Dianetics therapy model, and was acknowledged unreservedly as such by Hubbard in his early works.
146] Hubbard never forgot, when he was 12 years old, meeting Cmdr.
S.
Navy officer who had studied with Freud  and when writing to the American Psychological Association in 1949, he stated that he was conducting research based on the  early work of Freud .
Another major influence was Alfred Korzybski  s General Semantics .
146] Hubbard was friends with fellow science fiction writer A.
E.
Vogt , who explored the implications of Korzybski s non-Aristotelian logic in works such as The World of Null-A , and Hubbard s view of the reactive mind has clear and acknowledged parallels with Korzybski s thought; in fact, Korzybski s  anthropometer  may have been what inspired Hubbard s invention of the E-meter.
Beyond that, Hubbard himself named a great many other influences in his own writing – in Scientology 8-8008, for example, these include philosophers from Anaxagoras and Aristotle to Herbert Spencer and Voltaire , physicists and mathematicians like Euclid and Isaac Newton , as well as founders of religions such as Buddha , Confucius , Jesus and Mohammed  – but there is little evidence in Hubbard s writings that he studied these figures to any great depth.
As noted, there are elements of Eastern religions evident in Scientology,  in particular the concepts of karma , as present in Hinduism and in Jainism , and dharma .
149]  In addition to the links to Hindu texts, Hubbard tried to connect Scientology with Taoism and Buddhism .
In the 1940s, Hubbard was in contact with Jack Parsons , a rocket scientist and member of the Ordo Templi Orientis then led by Aleister Crowley , and there have been suggestions that this connection influenced some of the ideas and symbols of Scientology.
154]  Religious scholars Gerald Willms and J.
Gordon Melton have stated that Crowley s teachings bear little if any resemblance to Scientology doctrine.
According to James R.
Lewis , Scientology is in the same lineage of supernatural religious movements such as New Thought .
Scientology goes beyond this and refers to their religio-therapeutic practices as religious technology.
There are a considerable number of Scientology organizations  or orgs  which generally support one of the following three aims: enabling Scientology practice and training, promoting the wider application of Scientology technology, or campaigning for social change.
157] These organizations are supported by a three-tiered hierarchical structure comprising lay practitioners, staff and, at the top of the hierarchy, members of the so-called Sea Organization or Sea Org .
158] The Sea Org, comprising over 5,000 members, has been compared to the monastic orders found in other religions; it is composed of the most dedicated adherents, who work for nominal compensation and symbolically express their religious commitment by signing a billion-year contract.
The internal structure of Scientology organizations is strongly bureaucratic, with detailed coordination of activities and collection of stats – or statistics, to measure organizational and individual performance.
158] Organizational operating budgets are performance-related and subject to frequent reviews.
158] Scientology has an internal justice system  the Ethics system  designed to deal with unethical or antisocial behavior.
158]  Ethics officers are present in every org; they are tasked with ensuring correct application of Scientology technology and deal with violations such as non-compliance with standard procedures or any other behavior adversely affecting an org s performance, ranging from errors and misdemeanors to crimes and suppressive acts, as defined by internal documents.
A controversial part of the Scientology justice system is the Rehabilitation Project Force  RPF .
161] When a Sea Org member is accused of a violation, such as lying, sexual misconduct, dereliction of duty, or failure to comply with Church policy, a Committee of Evidence examines the case.
161] If the charge is substantiated, the individual may accept expulsion from the Sea Org or participate in the RPF to become eligible to rejoin the Sea Org.
161] The RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep.
161] Douglas E.
Cowan and David G.
Bromley state that scholars and observers have come to radically different conclusions about the RPF and whether it is  voluntary or coercive, therapeutic or punitive .
Many Scientologists  first contact with Scientology is through local informal groups and field auditors practicing Dianetics counseling.
162] In addition to these, Scientology operates hundreds of Churches and Missions around the world.
163] This is where Scientologists receive introductory training, and it is at this local level that most Scientologists participate.
163] Churches and Missions are licensed franchises; they offer services for a fee, and return a proportion of their income to the mother church.
163] They are also required to adhere to the standards established by the Religious Technology Center  RTC , which supervises the application of Scientology tech, owns the trademarks and service marks of Scientology, and collaborates with the Commodore s Messenger Organization to administer and control the various corporate entities within Scientology.
164]  According to Melton, the Religious Technology Center “preserves, maintains and protects Scientology against misuse or misinterpretation” but is not involved in Scientology daily affairs or management.
166] The RTC s Chairman is David Miscavige , who, while not the titular head of the Church of Scientology, is believed to be the most powerful person in the Scientology movement.
Once an individual has reached Clear and wishes to proceed further, he or she can take OT auditing and coursework with Advanced Organizations located in Los Angeles, Sydney, East Grinstead and Copenhagen .
168] Beyond OT V, the Flag Service Organization in Clearwater, Florida , offers the auditing and course work for OT levels VI and VII, while OT VIII is offered only by the Flag Ship Service Organization aboard the Scientology ship Freewinds.
169] Since 1981, all of these Churches and organizations have been united under the Church of Scientology International umbrella organization, with the Sea Org providing staff for all levels above the local Churches and Missions.
In 2012, the Ideal Center of Scientology for the Middle East opened in a refurbished historic building in Jaffa , Israel .
A number of Scientology organizations specialize in promoting the use of Scientology technology as a means to solve social problems.
Narconon is a drug education and rehabilitation program.
The program is founded on Hubbard s belief that drugs and poisons stored in the body impede spiritual growth, and was originally conceived by William Benitez, a prison inmate who applied Hubbard s ideas to rid himself of his drug habit.
163]  Narconon is offered in the United States, Canada and a number of European countries; its Purification Program uses a regimen composed of sauna , physical exercise, vitamins and diet management, combined with auditing and study.
Criminon is a program designed to rehabilitate criminal offenders by teaching them study and communication methods and helping them reform their lives.
163] The program originally grew out of the Narconon effort and today is available in over 200 prisons.
171] According to Melton, it has experienced steady growth, based on a good success rate, with low recidivism .
Applied Scholastics promotes the use of Hubbard s educational methodology, known as study tech .
172] Originally developed to help Scientologists study course materials, Hubbard s study tech is now used in some private and public schools as well.
173] Applied Scholastics is active across Europe and North America as well as in Australia, Malaysia , China and South Africa.
173] It supports literacy efforts in American cities and Third World countries, and its methodology is sometimes included in management training programs.
The Way to Happiness Foundation promotes a moral code written by Hubbard, to date translated into more than 40 languages.
The World Institute of Scientology Enterprises  WISE  is a not-for-profit organization which licenses Hubbard s management techniques for use in businesses.
172] The most prominent training supplier to make use of Hubbard s technology is Sterling Management Systems .
The Church of Scientology has also instituted a Volunteer Ministers program to provide disaster relief; for example, Volunteer Ministers were active in the aftermath of 9 11 , providing food and water and applying Scientology methods such as   Assists   to people in acute emotional distress.
176]  The Scientology Volunteer Ministers also used the  assist  to help Haiti quake victims.
178]  The Volunteer Ministers have also been sent to the site of relief efforts in Southeast Asia in the wake of the December 2004 tsunami and to London Underground stations that were attacked in July 7, 2005 London bombings.
Eight hundred were sent to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina.
180]  In March 2010, twelve Volunteer Ministers sailed from Miami to Haiti to bring medical supplies and join the existing 61 volunteers who were already in Haiti.
Since the earthquake, the Volunteer Ministers have been a consistent presence in the area, aiding in disaster relief.
Some Scientology organizations are focused on bringing about social change.
172] One of these is the Citizens Commission on Human Rights  CCHR .
Founded in 1969, it has a long history of opposing psychiatric practices such as lobotomy , electric shock treatment and the use of mood-altering drugs .
183]  The psychiatric establishment rejected Hubbard s theories in the early 1950s.
184] Ever since, Scientology has argued that psychiatry suffers from the fundamental flaw of ignoring humanity s spiritual dimension, and that it fails to take into account Hubbard s insights about the nature of the mind.
183] Scientology holds psychiatry responsible for a great many wrongs in the world, saying it has at various times offered itself as a tool of political suppression and  that psychiatry spawned the ideology which fired Hitler s mania, turned the Nazis into mass murderers, and created the Holocaust.    In recent years, the CCHR has conducted high-profile campaigns against Ritalin , given to children to control hyperactivity , and Prozac , a commonly used antidepressant .
184] Neither drug was taken off the market as a result of the campaign, but Ritalin sales decreased, and Prozac suffered bad press.
The main other organization in this field is the National Commission on Law Enforcement and Social Justice, devoted to combating what it describes as abusive practices by government and police agencies, especially Interpol .
Church of Spiritual Technology , a non-profit organization that owns the copyrights to Scientology books.
Although Scientology is most often used as shorthand for the Church of Scientology , a number of groups practice Scientology and Dianetics outside of the official church.
These groups, collectively known as the Free Zone or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the official Church of Scientology, as well as entirely new members.
Capt.
Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s.
187] The church labels these groups as   squirrels   in Scientology jargon and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.
188]   More recently, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder have championed the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church.
The Church of Scientology has pursued an extensive public relations campaign for the recognition of Scientology as a religion in the various countries in which it exists.
39]   Opinions around the world still differ on whether Scientology is to be recognized as a religion or not,  and Scientology has often encountered opposition due to its strong-arm tactics directed against critics and members wishing to leave the organization.
122] A number of governments now view the Church as a religious organization entitled to protections and tax relief, while others continue to view it as a pseudoreligion or cult.
196]  The differences between these classifications have become a major problem when discussing religions in general and Scientology specifically.
Scientology is officially recognized as a religion in the United States.
The New York Times noted in this connection that the Church of Scientology had funded a campaign which included a whistle-blower organization to publicly attack the IRS, as well as the hiring of private investigators to look into the private lives of IRS officials.
74] In 1991, Miscavige, the highest-ranking Scientology leader, arranged a meeting with Fred T.
Goldberg Jr.
Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service at the time.
201] The meeting was an  opportunity for the church to offer to end its long dispute with the agency, including the dozens of suits brought against the IRS.  The committee met several times with the Scientology legal team and  was persuaded that those involved in the Snow White crimes had been purged, that church money was devoted to tax-exempt purposes and that, with Mr. Hubbard s death, no one was getting rich from Scientology.   In August 1993, a settlement was reached; the church would receive its tax-exempt status and end its legal assault on the IRS and its personnel.
The church was required only to resubmit new applications for exemption to the IRS exempt organizations division; the division was told  not to consider any substantive matters  because those issues had been resolved by the committee.
74] The secret agreement was announced on October 13, 1993, with the IRS refusing to disclose any of the terms or the reasoning behind its decision.
74] Both the IRS and Scientology rejected any allegations of foul play or undue pressure having been brought to bear upon IRS officials, insisting that the decision had been based on the merits of the case.
202] IRS officials  insisted that Scientology s tactics had not affected the decision  and that  ultimately the decision was made on a legal basis .
74] Miscavige claims that the IRS’s examination of Scientology was the most exhaustive review of any non-profit organization in history.
Elsewhere, Scientology has been able to obtain religious recognition in such countries as Australia,   Portugal,  Spain,   Slovenia ,  Sweden,    Croatia ,  Hungary  and Kyrgyzstan .
211] In New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department classified the Church of Scientology as a charitable organization and stated that its income would be tax exempt.
212] It has gained judicial recognition in Italy,  and Scientology officials have won the right to perform marriages in South Africa.
Scientology has so far failed to win religious recognition in Canada.
14] In the UK, the Charity Commission for England and Wales ruled in 1999 that Scientology was not a religion and refused to register the Church as a charity, although a year later, it was recognized as a not-for-profit body in a separate proceeding by the UK Revenue and Customs and exempted from UK value added tax .
14]  In December 2013, the United Kingdom’s highest court officially recognized Scientology as a religion.
The ruling was a response to a five-year legal battle by Scientologist Louisa Hodkin, who legally fought for the right to marry at the Church of Scientology chapel in central London.
Since 1997 Germany has considered Scientology to be in conflict with the principles of the nation s constitution.
It is seen as an anticonstitutional sect and a new version of political extremism and because there is  evidence for intentions against the free democratic basic order  it is observed by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
219]  In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl , published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune , drew parallels between the  organized oppression  of Scientologists in Germany and the treatment of Jews in 1930s  Nazi Germany.
221]  The letter was signed by Dustin Hoffman , Goldie Hawn and a number of other Hollywood celebrities and executives.
S.
Department of State said that Scientologists were discriminated against in Germany, but condemned the comparisons to the Nazis  treatment of Jews as extremely inappropriate, as did a United Nations Special Rapporteur .
S.
State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists and began to note Scientologists  complaints of harassment in its annual human rights reports,  as well as the annual International Religious Freedom Reports it has released from 1999 onwards.
225] Germany will continue to monitor Scientology s activities in the country, despite continued objection from Scientology which cites such monitoring as abuse of freedom of religion.
226] France and Belgium have not recognized Scientology as a religion, and Stephen A.
Kent , writing in 2001, noted that no such recognition had been obtained in Ireland , Luxembourg , Israel or Mexico either.
227] The Belgian State Prosecution Service has recommended that various individuals and organizations associated with Scientology should be prosecuted.
228]  An administrative court is to decide if charges will be pressed.
228]  In Greece, Scientology is not recognized as a religion by the Greek government, and multiple applications for religious status have been denied, for example in 2000 and 2003.
In 2000, the Italian Supreme Court ruled that Scientology is a religion for legal purposes.
231]  In recent years, religious recognition has also been obtained in other countries, including Sweden,   Spain,   Portugal,  Slovenia ,  Croatia  and Hungary,  as well as Kyrgyzstan  and the Republic of China  Taiwan .
Describing the available scholarship on Scientology, David G.
Bromley and Douglas E.
Cowan stated in 2006 that  most scholars have concluded that Scientology falls within the category of religion for the purposes of academic study, and a number have defended the Church in judicial and political proceedings on this basis.   Hugh B.
Bromley and Cowan noted in 2008 that Scientology s attempts  to gain favor with new religion scholars  had often been problematic.
Frank K.
Flinn, adjunct professor of religious studies at Washington University in St.
Louis wrote,  it is abundantly clear that Scientology has both the typical forms of ceremonial and celebratory worship and its own unique form of spiritual life.   Flinn further states that religion requires  beliefs in something transcendental or ultimate, practices  rites and codes of behavior  that re-inforce those beliefs and, a community that is sustained by both the beliefs and practices , all of which are present within Scientology.
While acknowledging that a number of his colleagues accept Scientology as a religion, sociologist Stephen A.
Kent writes:  Rather than struggling over whether or not to label Scientology as a religion, I find it far more helpful to view it as a multifaceted transnational corporation, only one element of which is religious  .
A belief does not need to be stated in traditional terms to fall within First Amendment protection.
J.
Scientology can be seen as a UFO religion in which the existence of extraterrestrial entities operating unidentified flying objects  UFOs  are an element of belief.
In this context, it is discussed in UFO Religions by Christopher Partridge,  and The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions by James R.
Lewis ,  while Susan Palmer draws several parallels with Raelianism .
Scientology is unique within the UFO culture because of this secretiveness, as well as because of the capitalist format under which they operate.
Scientology is also difficult to categorize.
While it bears strong similarities to the Ashtar Command or the Aetherius Society , its emphasis upon the Xenu event as the central message of the group seems to place them within the ancient astronaut tradition.
Either way, Scientology is perhaps most different from other UFO groups in their attempt to keep all of the space opera stuff under wraps.
They really would have preferred the rest of us not to know about Xenu and the galactic federation.

While NRM scholars have generally accepted the religious nature of Scientology, media reports have tended to express the opinion that  Scientology is a business, often given to criminal acts, and sometimes masquerading as a religion.    During his lifetime, Hubbard was accused of using religion as a façade for Scientology to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims.
248] The IRS cited a statement frequently attributed to Hubbard that the way to get rich was to found a religion.
249]  According to Melton, the statement is unsubstantiated, although several of Hubbard s science fiction colleagues do recall Hubbard raising the topic in conversation.
Hubbard grew up in a climate that was very critical of organized religion, and frequently quoted anti-religious sentiments in his early lectures.
251] The scholar Marco Frenschkowski   University of Mainz   has stated that it was not easy for Hubbard  to come to terms with the spiritual side of his own movement. Hubbard did not want to found a religion: he discovered that what he was talking about in fact was religion. This mainly happened when he had to deal with apparent memories from former lives. He had to defend himself about this to his friends.   Frenschkowski allows that there naturally were practical considerations about  how to present Scientology to the outside world , but dismisses the notion that presentation as a religion was just an expedient pretense, pointing to many passages in Hubbard s works that document his struggle with this issue.
The Church of Scientology denounces the idea of Hubbard starting a religion for personal gain as an unfounded rumor.
252] The Church also suggests that the origin of the rumor was a quote by George Orwell which had been misattributed to Hubbard.
253] Robert Vaughn Young , who left the Church in 1989 after being its spokesman for twenty years, suggested that reports of Hubbard making such a statement could be explained as a misattribution of Orwell, despite having encountered three of Hubbard s associates from his science fiction days who remembered Hubbard making statements of that sort in person.
254] It was Young who by a stroke of luck came up with the  Orwell quote :  but I have always thought there might be a lot of cash in starting a new religion, and we ll talk it over some time  It appears in a letter by George Orwell  signed Eric Blair   to a friend Jack Common, dated 16-February-38  February 16, 1938 , and was published in Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, vol.
1.
255] In 2006, Rolling Stone  s Janet Reitman writes Hubbard said the same thing to science fiction writer Lloyd Eshbach , a fact quoted in Eshbach s autobiography.
Scientology maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, icons, and names.
It claims copyright and trademark over its  Scientology cross , and its lawyers have threatened lawsuits against individuals and organizations who have published the image in books and on Web sites.
Because of this, it is very difficult for individual groups to attempt to publicly practice Scientology on their own, independent of the official Church of Scientology.
Scientology has filed suit against a number of individuals who have attempted to set up their own auditing practices, using copyright and trademark law to shut these groups down.
The Church of Scientology and its many related organizations have amassed considerable real estate holdings worldwide, likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
35] Scientology encourages existing members to  sell  Scientology to others by paying a commission to those who recruit new members.
35] Scientology franchises, or missions, must pay the Church of Scientology roughly 10% of their gross income.
258] On that basis, it is likened to a pyramid selling scheme .
259] While introductory courses do not cost much, courses at the higher levels may cost several thousand dollars each.
260] As a rule, the great majority of members proceeds up the bridge in a steady rate commensurate with their income.
Most recently the Italian Supreme Court agreed with the American IRS that the church s financial system is analogous to the practices of other groups and not out of line with its religious purposes.
In conjunction with the Church of Scientology s request to be officially recognized as a religion in Germany, around 1996 the German state Baden-Württemberg conducted a thorough investigation regarding the group s activities within Germany.
262] The results of this investigation indicated that at the time of publication, Scientology s main sources of revenue   Haupteinnahmequellen der SO   were from course offerings and sales of their various publications.
50 to about DM 30,000 – the equivalent today of approximately $119 to $19,560 USD.
Revenue from monthly, bi-monthly, and other membership offerings could not be estimated in the report, but was nevertheless placed in the millions.
Defending its practices against accusations of profiteering , the Church has countered critics by drawing analogies to other religious groups who have established practices such as tithing , or require members to make donations for specific religious services.
Official German information leaflets from the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution on  from left to right  Islamic extremism , Scientology, and organized crime .
Several states published pamphlets about Scientology  and other religious groups  that detailed the Church s ideology and practices.
States defended the practice by noting their responsibility to respond to citizens  requests for information about Scientology as well as other subjects.
While many of the pamphlets were factual and relatively unbiased, some warned of alleged dangers posed by Scientology to the political order, to the free market economic system, and to the mental and financial well being of individuals.
Beyond the Government s actions, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church have been public opponents of Scientology.
Of the many new religious movements to appear during the 20th century, the Church of Scientology has, from its inception, been one of the most controversial , coming into conflict with the governments and police forces of several countries  including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada,  France  and Germany .
6]     It has been one of the most litigious religious movements in history, filing countless lawsuits against governments, organizations and individuals.
Reports and allegations have been made, by journalists, courts, and governmental bodies of several countries, that the Church of Scientology is an unscrupulous commercial enterprise that harasses its critics and brutally exploits its members.

Attempts to legally force search engines such as Google and Yahoo!
Scientology from their search engines  and in Google s case, AdSense  , or at least the first few search pages.
Allegations by a former high-ranking Scientologist that Scientology leader David Miscavige beats and demoralizes staff, and that physical violence by superiors towards staff working for them is a common occurrence in the church.
274]  Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis denied these claims and provided witnesses to rebut them.
In October 2009, a French court found the Church of Scientology guilty of organized fraud.
Four officers of the organization were fined and given suspended prison sentences of up to 2 years.
Prosecutors had hoped to achieve a ban of Scientology in France, but due to a temporary change in French law, which  made it impossible to dissolve a legal entity on the grounds of fraud , no ban was pronounced.
276] The sentence was confirmed by appeal court in February 2012.
In November 2009, Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used a speech in Federal Parliament to allege that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organization.
Due to these allegations, a considerable amount of investigation has been aimed at the church, by groups ranging from the media to governmental agencies.
Scientology social programs such as drug and criminal rehabilitation have likewise drawn both support and criticism.
Stephen A.
Kent , a professor of sociology, has said that  Scientologists see themselves as possessors of doctrines and skills that can save the world, if not the galaxy.   As stated in Scientology doctrine:  The whole agonized future of this planet, every man, woman and child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology.   Kent has described Scientology s ethics system as  a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefited  ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people s interests in things other than Scientology. .
Many former members have come forward to speak out about the Church and the negative effects its teachings have had on them, including celebrities such as Leah Remini .
Remini spoke about her split from the Church, saying that she still has friends within the organization that she is no longer able to speak to.
In the 1990s, representatives of Scientology began to take action against increased criticism of Scientology on the Internet.
The organization says that the actions taken were to prevent distribution of copyrighted Scientology documents and publications online, fighting what it refers to as  copyright terrorists .
Usenet servers to delete the group.
288] In practice, this rmgroup message had little effect, since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when sent to groups that receive substantial traffic, and newgroup messages were quickly issued to recreate the group on those servers that did not do so.
However, the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free-speech advocates.
289]  Among the criticisms raised, one suggestion is that Scientology s true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics.
An Internet-based group which refers to itself as   Anonymous   held protests outside Scientology centers in cities around the world in February 2008 as part of Project Chanology .
Issues they protested ranged from alleged abuse of followers to the validity of its claims to qualify as a state-sponsored religion.
The Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the World Wide Web , and lobbied for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general.
The Church supported the controversial Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act as well as the even more controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act  DMCA .
Some of the DMCA  s provisions  notably the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act   were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US Internet service providers over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers.
Beginning in the middle of 1996 and ensuing for several years, the newsgroup was attacked by anonymous parties using a tactic dubbed sporgery by some, in the form of hundreds of thousands of forged spam messages posted on the group.
Some investigators said that some spam had been traced to church members.
On January 14, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Tom Cruise was leaked to the Internet and uploaded to YouTube .
297]   The Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube requesting the removal of the video.
300] Subsequently, the group Anonymous voiced its criticism of Scientology and began attacking the Church.
301] Calling the action by the Church of Scientology a form of Internet censorship , participants of Anonymous coordinated Project Chanology , which consisted of a series of denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites, prank calls , and black faxes to Scientology centers.
302]     On January 21, 2008, Anonymous announced its intentions via a video posted to YouTube entitled  Message to Scientology , and a press release declaring a  war  against both the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center .
305]  In the press release, the group stated that the attacks against the Church of Scientology would continue in order to protect the freedom of speech , and end what they saw as the financial exploitation of church members.
A protester criticizes Scientology.
On January 28, 2008, an Anonymous video appeared on YouTube calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008.
309]  According to a letter Anonymous e-mailed to the press, about 7,000 people protested in more than 90 cities worldwide.
311] Many protesters wore masks based on the character V from V for Vendetta  who was influenced by Guy Fawkes   or otherwise disguised their identities, in part to protect themselves from reprisals from the Church of Scientology.
312]  Many further protests have followed since then in cities around the world.
The Arbitration Committee of the Wikipedia internet encyclopedia decided in May 2009 to restrict access to its site from Church of Scientology IP addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by Scientologists.
315]  A  host of anti-Scientologist editors  were topic-banned as well.
315]  The committee concluded that both sides had  gamed policy  and resorted to  battlefield tactics , with articles on living persons being the  worst casualties .
During the auditing process, the auditor may collect personal information from the person being audited.
317] Auditing records are referred to within Scientology as preclear folders.
318] The Church of Scientology has strict codes designed to protect the confidentiality of the information contained in these folders.
317] However, people leaving Scientology know that the Church is in possession of very personal information about them, and that the Church has a history of attacking and psychologically abusing those who leave it and become critics.
318] On December 16, 1969, a Guardian s Office order  G.
O.
121669  by Mary Sue Hubbard authorized the use of auditing records for purposes of  internal security.   Some former members have said that while they were still in the Church, they combed through information obtained in auditing sessions to see if it could be used for smear campaigns against critics.
Hubbard envisaged that celebrities would have a key role to play in the dissemination of Scientology, and in 1955 launched Project Celebrity, creating a list of 63 famous people that he asked his followers to target for conversion to Scientology.
322] In a church policy letter in 1973, L.
Ron Hubbard wrote,  The purpose of  Celebrity Centre is, to forward the expansion and popularization of Scientology through the arts.   Former silent-screen star Gloria Swanson and jazz pianist Dave Brubeck were among the earliest celebrities attracted to Hubbard s teachings; in recent decades, prominent actors—including Tom Cruise and John Travolta —have spoken publicly about their commitment to Scientology.
Scientology operates eight churches that are designated Celebrity Centres , the largest of these is in Hollywood, California, called Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International.
The Celebrity Centre International was the first one that was opened in 1969 and its opening is celebrated the first week of August each year in an evening gala.

It further presents the only complete chronological overview of his life and discoveries.
If you happened to be in Copenhagen, Denmark the afternoon of October 25, you could have seen the future of Scientology in Europe unfold literally before your eyes.
It all began in 1984, a time when Scientology could be found in just 39 nations on the planet.
Thirty years later, members of the International Association of Scientologists  IAS  hail from 130 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, fortifying the Churchâ€™s stature as the only world religion to emerge in the 20th century that s also thriving well into the 21st.
More than 4,000 Scientologists gathered in downtown Clearwater, Florida, on Sunday, June 29, to mark the dedication of the landmark Coachman Building.
The historic structure now stands transformed as the religious training and counseling center for more than 2,000 members comprising the ecclesiastical ministry of the Flag Land Base, the international spiritual headquarters of Scientology.
There are only two tests of a life well lived, L.
Ron Hubbard once remarked: Did one do as one intended?
And were people glad one lived?
In testament to the first stands the full body of his lifeâ€™s work, including the more than 12,000 writings and 3,000 tape-recorded lectures of Dianetics and Scientology.
You are an immortal spiritual being.
Your experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.
And your capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.
Furthermore, Man is basically good.
He is seeking to survive.
And his survival depends upon himself and his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe.

Dating back to 2009, the reports shed unprecedented light on the inner workings of the secretive church, which has its spiritual headquarters in Clearwater.

Check out the Church of Scientology s latest glossy Freedom magazine, and you ll see some advice for the city of Clearwater from former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco.

And they won t say why.
Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige has sidestepped giving a deposition in a high-profile harassment lawsuit filed in Texas by Monique Rathbun, wife of vocal church critic Marty Rathbun.
Attorney General Pam Bondi, who already has raised millions for her re-election campaign, can expect to pull in more dollars tonight at a Clearwater fundraiser where all six organizers are prominent members of the Church of Scientology.
CLEARWATER — For downtown Clearwater to thrive, city leaders and the Church of Scientology should work together and communicate better, a group of outside experts recommended Friday.

Rathbun left the Church of Scientology staff in late 2004, ending a 27-year career that saw him rise to be a top lieutenant under church leader David Miscavige.
He spent the next four years living a low-profile existence in Texas.
Some speculated he had died.
In February 2009, Rathbun surfaced on the Internet, announcing on a new web page that he was available to counsel other disaffected Scientologists.
Contacted that month by the Tampa Bay Times, Rathbun agreed to tell the story of his years in Scientology and what led to his leaving.
Thus began the long-running Tampa Bay Times series,  Inside Scientology,  which sheds unprecedented light on the internal workings of a secretive church that counts Clearwater as its spiritual home.
The organization also generates interest and controversy around the world.
The Times  conversations with Rathbun led to interviews with scores of other people in the Scientology world, including former staffers, former parishioners and current church members.
Times journalists often traveled the country to meet their subjects face-to-face.
They also requested interviews with church officials, who initially spoke with the reporters but later responded to Times inquiries with only written answers.
The newspaper has given prominence to the church s responses.
Scientologists and former Scientologists revealed aspects of the church previously unknown to the public, including how church upper level managers engaged in violent behavior, how the church controls its members and how it pressures and pesters them to donate far beyond their financial means.
The result of the Times  reporting is this multi-part special report, the latest in a long history of Scientology coverage by the newspaper.
The Times won a Pulitzer Prize for a 1979 report on Scientology.
And in the years since, with the church s Clearwater headquarters in the Times  prime coverage area, the in-depth reporting has continued.
Two veteran Times journalists have reported this series.
Joe Childs, Senior Editor At Large, ran the Times Clearwater operation dating to 1993 and supervised the newspaper s Scientology coverage.

This is going to make history.

I m leaving stuff out.
Brother is amazing, and you are in for a treat.
I m in for some trouble, and you re about to find out why.
Mr.
Jamie DeWolf.
Jamie DeWolf: Every family has their black sheep.
On my mother s side, our black sheep was a shepherd who enslaved his own flock, the king of cons, a man who made himself a messiah even though he never called himself a god.
Even tonight, his words are written in steel, in titanium capsules, in a nuclear reinforced bunker miles underground.
So if our whole species goes extinct, his words will still survive.
He was a subject we never talked about at the kids  table at family reunions, but he was my great grandfather, L.
Ron Hubbard.
Lafayette Ron Hubbard, he was born a storyteller, a science fiction writer, a golden tongued grifter who could write a book in any genre while the publisher waited downstairs in the hotel lobby.
You want to know how you really get rich?
A year later, he kept to his word, wrote  Dianetics,  transforming science fiction into fact until you could pay to flat line your mind for a fee.
Overnight, he went from pennies to a prophet until the world demanded to see his evidence.
But L.
Ron knew if you don t have facts, all you need is faith.
So he transformed his science into a religion, and Scientology was born.
A few years later, his son arrived, a baby who survived an early abortion attempt, born premature at two pounds, two ounces, abandoned by his father as he sought fame and fortune.
Now he emerged to take his part of the new family business.
He was my grandfather, L.
Ron Hubbard Jr.
Carrying his father s name and his red hair, Junior became his right hand man and was a devout disciple and a believer, helping them to construct the church.
It took him years to realize he was only another accomplice.
Trained in the arts of electrified hypnotism, blackmail and beat downs, he learned to hide his crimes behind his charisma.
And it took him a decade to see the holes behind the holy, the man behind the myth, his father, stuffing thousands of dollars in a shoe box he kept secret underneath the bed.
His father, burning incriminating documents before dawn.
His father, escaping criminal charges as he ran from state to state as Junior watched his family and friends, brains washed, banks broken.
Sickened by what he had seen behind the curtain, in 1959, Junior left.
But his Father always understood retribution better than redemption, and he stalked his son with wiretaps, break ins and death threats, my grandfather coming home to photographs of his children in his mailbox playing on playgrounds alone and unguarded to remind him the eye of the pyramid never blinks.
While every one of my aunts and uncles were taught how to use a gun, the son forced to live like his dad, permanently on the run until he changed his last name from Hubbard to DeWolf, a lie to protect him from every having to tell the truth.
When your father has created a religion in your lifetime, there s no sun big enough to ever escape his shadow.
But there s a thin line between prophecy and psychosis, and the bare faced messiah run from countries and criminal charges, an international outlaw on a ship escaping extradition, his sanity slipping as he started confusing his past from his fiction.
Until one day, he vanished before a courtroom or a jail cell could ever make him real again.
Junior, now buried under debt, tried to flush his father out of hiding to write him a check.
So he litigated the holy ghost to prove he still had flesh.
The son took his war public, scraped the idol s gold down to rust.
Junior, now a dying diabetic with an amputated foot, buried and battered from a decade of lawsuits against the man who carried his same name until the day his dad died in hiding, cremated the next morning, leaving only a legacy of ashes.
The church gave the son on final offer.
Arrest your tongue, swallow the truth for one final check, or you and your next of kin will suffer a lifetime of threats.
So he signed away his silence and took his secrets and two heart attacks to his grave, another victim the church stopped pretending to save.
On Thanksgiving in a house a self-made god paid for, his grand children never said his name.
He was the one god we never gave grace to.
One day, my grandfather led me to a bookshelf and showed me his father s works.
Your mom says you want to be a writer.
I never met the man who gave me my red hair.
The manic depression is still twisted in the strains of my DNA.
And the first time I saw a psychiatrist.
I could say was,  Yes. Yes it does.  When I told him my great grandfather was a cult leader that enslaved the minds of millions, he accused me of having delusions of grandeur.
What can I say?
It runs in my veins.
I ve been, in secret, to L.
Ron Hubbard Hollywood Life Exhibits, where his latest victim leads me on a tour of a life he never led, my family written out of existence.
And this disciple will never know the legacy of lies that I still carry in my last name.
DeWolf, a cover story to protect us from my great grandfather s true children, the army of empty who greet me in train stations with an E-meter and a personality test.
And they ask me if I ve ever heard of L.

Church of Scientology web site.
The Church of Scientology is a relatively new faith, founded by American  science fiction fantasy author Lafayette Ronald Hubbard   1911-1986 .
He is most commonly referred to as L.
Ron Hubbard.
The word Scientology means the  study    of knowledge or truth.  The Church attempts to address the rehabilitation and salvation of     humanity.
Unlike many new religions, Scientology survived the death of his founder in 1986.
It is now led by David Miscavige, a friend of Hubbard.
The total number of Scientologists in the world    is extremely difficult to estimate, for a variety of reasons.
Estimates range    from 8 million  as stated by the Church itself  to 100,000 as estimated by skeptics.
The Church of Scientology has been recognized as a religious organization by some countries, and banned in others.
It has been criticized by some critics as more of a cult or a corporation than a religion.
Currently, it is perhaps the most controversial of the new religious movements  NRMs .
Until 2014-OCT, this menu included links to a number of essays on Scientology.
However, after reassessing their quality, we concluded that they do not meet the standards expected of essays on this web site.
On 2014-OCT-05, we  temporarily removed these essays from the Internet.
We are rewriting them.
Negative publicity, however, has not prevented the Church from experiencing    remarkably steady growth.
Official national census figures indicate that the    number of Scientologists grew significantly in Canada, New Zealand, and    Australia throughout the 1990s, and studies show that the Church gained 10,000    members in the United States during that decade.
This has led Scientology to    begin referring to itself as  The World s Fastest Growing Religion.  But despite    its highly public profile, recently enhanced by celebrity spokespersons like Tom    Cruise and Isaac Hayes, little has been published about the Church, its history,    theology, and mission.
The present volume brings together an international group of top scholars on New    Religious Movements to offer an extensive and even-handed overview and analysis    of all of these aspects of Scientology, including the controversies to which it    continues to give rise.
The book s six parts take a detailed look at the Church    through its similarities to and differences from other religions, conflicts with    various groups, overseas missions, and its theology, history, and sociology.
James R.
Lewis has assembled an unusually comprehensive anthology, incorporating    a wide range of different approaches.
This volume is a welcome and long-overdue    resource for scholars, students, and others interested in this controversial and    little-understood religious movement.
Lawrence Wright,  Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief,  Vintage, 2013-NOV, 560 pages.
27 plus shipping in Paperback.
This book was honored as a National Book Award Finalist,    National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist,    A New York Times Notable Book,  A Best Book of the Year: The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, New York magazine, Slate, Chicago Tribune, Huffington Post, Newsday, Entertainment Weekly, People, The Week, Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews and a GoodReads Reader s Choice!
Scientology presents itself as a scientific approach to spiritual   enlightenment, but its practices have long been shrouded in mystery.
Now   Lawrence Wright -- armed with his investigative talents, years of archival   research, and more than two hundred personal interviews with current   and former Scientologists -- uncovers the inner workings of the church.
We   meet founder L.
Ron Hubbard, the highly imaginative but mentally   troubled science-fiction writer, and his tough, driven successor, David   Miscavige.
We go inside their specialized cosmology and language.
We   learn about the church’s legal attacks on the IRS, its vindictive   treatment of critics, and its phenomenal wealth.
We see the church court   celebrities such as Tom Cruise while consigning its clergy to hard   labor under billion-year contracts.
Through it all, Wright asks what   fundamentally comprises a religion, and if Scientology in fact merits   this Constitutionally-protected label.
Brilliantly researched,   compellingly written, Going Clear pulls back the curtain on one of the most secretive organizations at work today.

Along with Tom and Katie, who else is a Scientology couple in Hollywood?
The word Scientology is taken from the Latin scio, which means  knowing, in the fullest sense of the word,  and the Greek word logos, meaning  study of.  It literally means knowing how to know.
Scientology is a twenty-first-century religion.
It comprises a vast body of knowledge extending from certain fundamental truths, and prime among those truths: Man is a spiritual being endowed with abilities well beyond those which he normally envisions.
He is not only able to solve his own problems, accomplish his goals and gain lasting happiness, but he can achieve new states of awareness he may never have dreamed possible.
In one form or another, all great religions have held the hope of spiritual freedom—a condition free of material limitations and misery.
The question has always been, however, how does one reach such a state, particularly while still living amidst a frantic and often overwhelming society?
Although modern life seems to pose an infinitely complex array of problems, Scientology maintains that the solutions to those problems are basically simple and within every man s reach.
Difficulties with communication and interpersonal relationships, nagging insecurities, self-doubt and despair—each man innately possesses the potential to be free of these and many other concerns.
Because the fundamentals upon which Scientology rests embrace all aspects of life, certain key principles can be broadly employed to improve any condition.

For no matter the situation, with Scientology, something can be done about it.
Scientology is a religion in its highest meaning, as it helps bring man to total freedom and truth.
Developed by L.
Ron Hubbard, Scientology is a religion that offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one’s true spiritual nature and one’s relationship to self, family, groups, Mankind, all life forms, the material universe, the spiritual universe and the Supreme Being.
Scientology addresses the spirit—not the body or mind—and believes that Man is far more than a product of his environment, or his genes.
Scientology comprises a body of knowledge which extends from certain fundamental truths.
His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.
His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.
Scientology further holds Man to be basically good, and that his spiritual salvation depends upon himself, his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe.
Drawn from half a century of research, the articles in this book encompass Scientology basics for all parts of existence, answers to questions Man has sought through the ages; answers you hoped could be found somewhere, answers that work.
Scientology follows a long tradition of religious practice.
Its roots lie in the deepest beliefs and aspirations of all great religions, thus encompassing a religious heritage as old and as varied as Man himself.
Though it draws on the wisdom of some 50,000 years, Scientology is a new religion, one that has isolated fundamental laws of life and, for the first time, developed a workable technology that can be applied to help people achieve a happier and more spiritual existence in the here and now.
That Scientology’s development and rapid promulgation was made possible, in part, by advances in the physical sciences through the first half of the twentieth century is significant.
For it bridges Eastern philosophy with Western thought.
In that way, Scientology constitutes Man’s first real application of scientific methodology to spiritual questions.
For thousands of years Man has searched for the true meaning of life.
In Scientology, that search has culminated—for the secret has now been discovered.
Here are the answers.
And with exact Scientology techniques, you’ll discover them for yourself.
Because Scientology is the knowledge of you.
Scientology is a truly unique contemporary religion—the only new major religion to emerge in the twentieth century.
While the hope for spiritual freedom is ancient, what Scientology is doing is new.
The way it is organized is new.
The technologies with which it can bring about a new state of being in Man are likewise new.
Because Scientology addresses Man as a spiritual being, it stands completely apart from other fields which see Man as a product of his environment or his genes—fixed in the limitations under which he was born.
In contrast, Scientology is the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes and other life.
Based upon the tradition of 50 thousand years of thinking men, it is built upon the fundamental truths of life.
From these principles, exact methods by which one can improve conditions were derived.
And unlike other efforts of improvement, which offered only rules by which men should live, Scientology offers real tools for use in everyday life.
Thus, it does not depend upon a system of beliefs or faith.
In Scientology no one is asked to accept anything as belief or on faith.
That which is true for you is what you have observed to be true.
An individual discovers for himself that Scientology works by personally applying its principles and observing or experiencing results.
What are your goals?
Where are you going?
Why are you here?
What are you?
Scientology has answers to these questions, good answers that are true, answers that work for you.
No matter the difficulties you may be facing in life, Scientology offers answers.
It provides an exact technology with step-by-step procedures you can use to handle problems and better your life and the lives of those around you.

For no matter the situation, with Scientology, something can be done about it.
Scientologists come from all walks of life.
They are concerned about social problems and support numerous social betterment programs, which provide effective drug-abuse rehabilitation, improve educational standards and help reduce crime and moral decay.
Scientologists come from diverse lands, cultures and backgrounds.
They are doctors, educators, inventors, athletes, actors, musicians, students, photographers, business owners and more.
To understand how practicing Scientology has impacted their lives, it is best to hear directly from them.
So we present the opportunity to  Meet a Scientologist  with a series of short documentaries profiling the lives and careers of Church members.
To meet the global demand for Dianetics and Scientology, a new breed of Scientology Church is being opened in major cities around the world.
An Ideal Org is configured to provide the full services of the Scientology religion to its parishioners, while also serving the community with social betterment and outreach programs.
To date, dozens of Ideal Orgs have opened their doors in major cities across four continents, and new ones are dedicated each month.
The Church sponsors Global Social Betterment & Humanitarian Programs which set in motion broad-scale movements in the name of morality, literacy, drug prevention and rehabilitation.
Karen de la Carriere, 70, was a member of the Church of Scientology for 35 years.
She was married to its President.
She held a level of  enlightenment  and a rank within its organization shared by only a handful of others.
She was one of its  rock stars .
But when she left in 2010 she was branded a  Suppressive Person , cast out, harassed and cut off from her son so completely that, when he died in 2012, she learned of his passing via a Facebook posting by a stranger.
Now, for the first time, she has given her full, personal and excoriating account and shared a treasure trove of previously unseen pictures from her years inside the notoriously secretive organization.
Devoted then devoured: Karen left the church finally in 2010 and her husband has not been seen in public since 2004.
In an emotional interview with MailOnline she told of the punishments she claims she endured, often stretching across months.
In the name of spiritual enlightenment they all but broke her physically and mentally.
She said they made her feel like an  amoeba .
She says she had to run for 12 hours a day for three months.
She says she was ordered to chip paint off metal bars for days on end.
And for six months, she claims she was held against her will in a section of Scientology’s Int Base in the Californian desert known by members as  The Hole , while her husband was sent to Germany and her baby kept from her.
Scientology is like tsunami of destruction.
She spoke of a culture of fear and financial dependence  on leaving she was told she had a debt of $90,000 to clear  and showed MailOnline documents which suggest its international management team, Sea Org, bans members who have children from remaining in service, which she claims has led to members having abortions to keep their status within the church.
The Church of Scientology has vigorously responded to Karen s claims and dismissed her as somebody who  will literally say anything to get attention .
A spokesman claims she has previously made  false and unsubstantiated claims about the church .
To its celebrity members the church is part concierge, part fixer.
But for the rest, according to Karen, it governs through constant observation, oppressing rebellion and nurturing informants.
Karen said:  Scientology is like tsunami of destruction.
It launches at you and when it retreats it leaves behind broken lives, damaged people, bankrupt people, people who thought they were buying a dream but were sold a monster .
Speaking from her home in Los Angeles, barely 40 minutes drive from the compound in which she was held all those years ago, she explained:  The dark part of Scientology never surfaces as you enter the door, but the higher up the levels you go the more it s brought out.
Look, if you throw a frog in boiling hot water it will leap out on its back feet in a New York second.
But put it in and slowly turn up the heat and it will slowly take it hotter and hotter and hotter .
Trusted: Heber, left, often appeared on TV as a spokesperson for the church.
I know that Travolta would phone up Heber and talk about his worries, or troubles, ask him questions.
It was more than an official thing,  said Karen.
It was a friendship.
He was close enough to ask Heber what should he do in any situation.
Karen was in her early twenties and living in London when she was introduced to Scientology by a boyfriend.
The love affair didn t last, but she was hooked on Scientology from her first Audit.
Auditing is central to Scientology.
The subject, or  Pre-Clear   PC  answers questions posed by a trained  auditor  while hooked up to an E-meter, a polygraph of sorts that purports to read moods and gauge signs of spiritual distress.
The goal is to attain a  Clear  state.
In 1975 she signed a simple pledge and entered the Sea Org – the management team styled as a sort of faux navy by church s founder and sci-fi writer L Ron Hubbard.
She thought the whole enterprise  benign  and well intentioned.
She wanted to do well.
Within three years Karen had achieved Class XII Case Supervisor status.
To this day there are less than 60 auditors to have received what is, for them, the highest honor.
She met Heber Jentzsch, a senior officer in the public relations department, and they married in 1978.
David Mayo – L Ron Hubbard s personal auditor - gave her away.
I know that Travolta would phone up Heber and talk about his worries, or troubles, ask him questions.
It was more than an official thing.
It was a friendship.
He was close enough to ask Heber what should he do in any situation.
Heber often appeared on television as a spokesperson for the church.
According to Karen that role was later taken over by David Miscavige who jealously guarded the church s VIP members.
But for many years Heber counted John Travolta in particular as a friend.
The star would regularly visit Heber in his office and was fond of her son Alex.
Karen would never, she said, have dreamed of asking Heber what secrets they shared but she said:  I know that Travolta would phone up Heber and talk about his worries, or troubles, ask him questions.
It was more than an official thing.
It was a friendship.
He was close enough to ask Heber what should he do in any situation.
Travolta loved Heber.
But in 1982 she was confronted with a reality that made her question everything.
In an attempt to raise funds, she said, the church was drawing members from all over the country and offering procedures called L10, L11 and L12.
These intense auditing courses promised miraculous results to truly troubled – desperate - individuals and charged $1,000 an hour.
Karen was the Case Supervisor in charge but to her dismay she was presented with people she claims were suicidal and psychotic day after day and who she says were already under psychiatric care.
Jazzing up the church: Chick Corea attends a wedding pictured with Karen s son, Alex  center .
No child policy: Karen produced an order that was handed down to all Sea Org members  the elite branch of the church  that set out a ban on children.
Badge of honor: Karen reached Class XII Case Supervisor status.
Karen recalled:  I had people threatening to throw themselves from the tenth floor onto the cement below.
Scientology is mindlessly anti-psychiatry and here we were disingenuously and hypocritically accepting psychiatric patients.
Karen complained, she said, she fought  tooth and nail , to eject the Pre-Clears she believed she simply was not qualified to help.
And she was punished for it.
She recalled:  The church has an intelligence bureau.
It used to be called the Guardians Office, now it s the Office for Special Affairs.
I was summoned and told I was being sent to the Rehabilitation Project Force .
That is the mind control, Gulag of the church.
It s rough – sleep deprivation, cold left over Oliver Twist food, hard manual labor.
But Karen s particular punishment was as bizarre as it was brutal, she claimed.
She said:  I was a guinea pig.
For 12 hours a day I had to run around a pole.
Today it s called the Running Program – they sell it.
On the sixth floor of their  cathedral  in Florida there s a running track and you give the church $2,500 and you run for 5 hours a day or more.
And it did give Karen an enlightenment of sorts.
She explained,  I was on that every single day for three months.
I hit a very low point.
I was squashed like a subatomic particle.
I was an amoeba.
I was crushed, just moving robotically like a puppet to move my body round the track.
But I swore as I ran round that track, one day I will tell the story about what really goes on in the Church of Scientology.
Until that point, Karen admitted, she had been aware of punishments but had believed completely Scientology s teaching that any punishment was something a person  pulled in  towards themselves through their own  evil intentions .
But now, she said,  I saw there was no humanity, there was no mercy I had served the church now I saw I was a slave within the church.
You have no possessions.
You have no money reserves, you re making peanuts, you can t fend on your own .
For 12 hours a day I had to run around a pole.
I hit a very low point.
I was squashed like a subatomic particle.
In 1984 her son Alexander was born and her joy at motherhood blotted out the darkness she now felt.
She wanted another child but according to Karen, the year after Alex s birth,  I saw the pressure starting - no more children, bulletins  were issued about it .
The church loves only itself.
Children get in the way of productivity .
It might be hard for an outsider to understand how the threat of expulsion would be enough to see a woman abort a longed for child but for members this wasn t about losing a job.
This was about losing an entire life.
MailOnline has seen a bulletin of one of the many  orders  posted by Sea Org on the subject.
It states,  The Sea Org is the only group which is taking complete responsibility to handle the whole planet.
This is a huge task and…requires complete dedication from its staff.
The Sea Org is not set up to handle or take care of children.
Sea Org members getting children has resulted in unpractical burden…and inhibited efficiency.
It goes onto explain that expectant parents will be  sent to a Class V org for duty  - a lower level of the church.
His eyes were  cold, cold steel : Karen claims that once she was summoned without warning by David Miscavige, above, who told her to  hit the decks .
He d condemned her to the most brutal treatment in the name of spiritual cleansing.
The Hole: Karen was sent to the Suppressive Persons  Hold at Int Base, California, white roofed building above.
There she did ten days of hard manual labor, chipping paint off iron bars.
I was not allowed any personal hygiene.
When you work for hours and sweat, it s humiliating to smell and not be allowed to even brush your teeth or chance your clothes,  she said.
Karen claimed Heber was sent to Germany and her son was taken to a Scientology Nursery.
A church spokesman told MailOnline that since 1986  it has been the policy of the Church that if married members of its religious order, the Sea Organization, wish to have children, they must do so outside the Sea Organization and return once the children are grown .
The spokesman added that it has never recommended abortions to staff or parishioners.
Karen said:  Heber and I petitioned the International Executive Director – a puppet of David Miscavige.
It took us weeks to put together.
We attached all the evidence that we are productive people of magnitude.
The petition came back denied and Heber was severely punished and reprimanded .
Throughout the interview Karen veers between high passion and weary sorrow.
Invariably when she speaks of Heber it is with a deep sadness.
Heber has not been seen or heard from publicly since 2004.
Yet back then they accepted that they could not have more children.
Heber took his punishment and they carried on.
The church responded to Karen s claims saying that  Reverend Jentzsch turns 79 next month and is living in semi-retirement at a church facility.
He is in regular touch with family and friends, participates in Scientology services as a church parishioner, but given his age no longer makes public appearances on behalf of the church .
In 1986 L Ron Hubbard died and Miscavige rose to power – today his official title is Chairman of the Board of Religious Technology Center  RTC .
Today, according to Karen:  David Miscavige runs the show with an iron fist and a dark heart .
There have been many allegations of violence leveled against Miscavige by members of Sea Org who have left the church.
All have been hotly denied.
WANT  TOTAL FREEDOM ?
They join to cross the Bridge to  Total Freedom .
But first members of the Church of Scientology sign contracts locking them into the faith not only for this lifetime but all the lives they believe come after.
They are bound for a billion years by legal documents in which they sign away their spiritual, physical and mental freedom.
In never-before-seen contracts for potential members of the elite Sea Org - seen by MailOnline - members jettison family or friends opposed to Scientology, absolve the church of any liability, surrender their right to sue or reclaim donations and give the church license to hold them hostage under 24 hour guard with no limit of time.
They accept the church’s  unalterably opposed  stand to psychiatry, instead placing their physical and mental health entirely in the hands of the church.
Similarly though the church denies any policy of  disconnecting  believers from family who are critical, members must state:  I am not connected with any person, such as by marital or familial ties, of known antagonism to spiritual treatment or to Scientology .
And in a clause that both Karen and her husband, Jeff Augustine - a retired corporate executive who has researched the legal make-up of the church extensively - dub a license to kidnap members surrender themselves to the  intensive, rigorous Religious Service , known as the Introspection Rundown.
They accept that this means  being isolated from all sources of potential upset, including but not limited to family members, friends or others ,  specifically consent to Church members being with me 24 hours a day ,  fully accept that the duration of any such isolation is uncertain  and determined by the church and absolve Scientology of any  known and unknown risks of injury, loss or damage  that might result.
Karen never witnessed any acts of violence through the years, but there was talk and Miscavige was someone she feared.
By the time he took over she was working in LA as Heber s assistant.
She was in the office when, one day she was summoned without warning by Miscavige.
She will never forget the look in his eyes that day.
It was  just cold, cold steel,  she said.
He didn t shout, he showed no emotion or empathy at all.
Instead he calmly told how she was to  hit the decks .
With those three words he brought Karen down to the  lowest of the low , she said, and condemned her to the most brutal treatment in the name of spiritual cleansing.
Her crime was to gossip about two senior members of the executive who had been removed from their posts.
She had shared information she had no business sharing, she said, and was told that this was the reason behind the punishment that followed.
That was a blood curdling sentence.
It meant,  Drive her to the limit  .
For ten days I did hard manual labor, chipping paint off iron bars,  she said.
I was not allowed any personal hygiene.
When you work for hours and sweat, it s humiliating to smell and not be allowed to even brush your teeth or change your clothes.
Heber was sent off to Germany – the government was investigating Scientology as a dangerous cult – and my son who was about two-years-old at the time was left in Los Angeles in a Scientology Nursery.
That s what drove me crazy.
David Miscavige s order was  Work her till those manicured fingernails are worked to the bone.  That was a blood curdling sentence.
He was completely orphaned.
For the next six months Karen claims she was subjected to the  Truth Rundown .
She was questioned for hours every day, sometimes woken at 2am and questioned by multiple interrogators.
When she finally emerged she was, she says, damaged and broken.
It is the only way she can explain why she remained in the church as long as she did and, to her eternal regret, why she allowed her son to enter Sea Org.
In 1988 under extreme pressure she and Heber divorced.
She later learned that Heber had been summoned and filed 24  Knowledge Reports  against her in one evening.
She explained:  The church uses intelligence as weapons.
This is a culture where husband reports on wife.
The child reports on the father…everybody reports to the mother church.
In 1990 Karen finally gathered the strength to  route out  of Sea Org.
This is a process of interrogations which can take weeks, months or even years.
All her auditors wanted to know, she said, was whether or not she intended to speak publicly against the church or try to claim child support.
She was told she had a debt of $90,000 for the training she had received.
She paid off that debt racking up huge credit card bills in the process.
She established a life, she remarried to husband Jeff Augustine, she built a career first in real estate and finally as successful online dealer in Thomas Kinkade paintings.
Yet she kept donating to the church.
She said,  I must was damaged, I was off-center.
When Alexander was eight he had asked to join Sea Org and to her enduring regret she let him.
In 2010 three Sea Org representatives visited her home and accused her of speaking with  supressive people .
They had learned that she had been in touch with friends who had left the church and spoken out.
They invited her to come back and be  cleared .
She refused.
Three weeks later she received a letter from Alexander.
She claimed:  He said to me that I had to make good with the Office of Special Affairs for him to have any kind of relationship with me.
Alexander was brought up in the church.
He was in their power.
Ripped apart: Her son Alex, with Karen on his wedding day.
When she left the church, he turned against her as he was part of Sea Org.
The church has always strenuously denied forcing members to  disconnect  from those who leave or speak out against it.
Every member has a choice.
But it is a stark one.
Sever contact or lose everything – job, community and eternal life.
When it comes down to it, the line between faith, and force, is very thin.
I m not speaking because I have some vendetta.
I m not saying that people can t believe what they want to believe.
I m speaking against the abuses that take place in the name of Scientology.
When Karen refused to come back she became  Fair Game .
This principle laid down by L Ron Hubbard states that a suppressive person can be  lied to, stolen from and destroyed .
Once out of the church they are fair game.
A bizarre and aggressive campaign attacking Karen s reputation followed, which the church denied to MailOnline.
She claims she was accused of trafficking children, she was reported to the health department for insanitary living conditions, she was reported to animal welfare for cruelty to the many pets she dearly loves, and claims details of a medical procedure were posted online even though she had only shared that information with her auditor.
And in the midst of all this, came the death of her son, and her exclusion from it.
Karen will always blame Scientology for her son s death.
Had he been in touch with her and had he not believed so strongly in their healing hands method of  Touch Assist , she is convinced he would have received proper medical care for the pneumonia that killed him at such a young age.
However, the church insists that her son was staying with his wife s parents when he contracted pneumonia and died.
A spokesman said that Karen has  shamelessly exploited this tragedy to wage an internet war against her son s father and to falsely blame him and the church even though the official autopsy found no such evidence exists , adding it was a  frivolous, false accusation .
In the statement the church has denied harrassing Karen as has dismissed her as being like a  biased lunatic who spreads falsehoods about the church because they have personal axes to grind .
But she insisted, her reason for speaking out, her motivation for blogging against the church and posting frequent and highly critical videos on  YouTube , goes beyond this deep personal pain.
She explained,  I’m not speaking because I have some vendetta.
I m not saying that people can t believe what they want to believe.
I m speaking against the abuses that take place in the name of Scientology.

Ex-Scientology Kids is designed, owned, and operated by three young women who grew up in Scientology, and later left the Church.
We feel that growing up in the Scientology environment is a unique experience that’s almost impossible to comprehend unless you’ve lived it yourself.
For what it’s worth, we offer non-judgmental support for those who are still in Scientology, discussion and debate for those who’ve already left, and a plethora of easy-to-understand references for the curious.
For the record, while the site admins make every effort to be non-judgemental, that doesn’t mean we’re unbiased.
Most of the people that write for this site have had extremely negative experiences in Scientology.
Some of us have lost our families due to Scientology’s Disconnection Policy, some of us have experienced physical abuse, and some of us were denied a proper education.
However, we do welcome pro-Scientology email, comments and forum posts.
There’s even a “no registration required” forum area where anyone may anonymously post questions, comments and advice.
Scientologists: We understand that you don’t want to ruin your case by accidentally looking at the OTIII materials, and we respect that.
We’ve done our best to keep all info on confidential materials clearly marked and partitioned off from the rest of the site.
If you want to look, look.
If ya don’t, ya don’t have to.
ESK is proud to announce the Voices in Unison project, a unique campaign created to help those who have never before told their Scientology story to speak out without fear of reprisal.

The celebrity is a special public,” a Church official says.
Franklin Avenue, skimming past the mouths of Hollywood’s eastern canyons, at the disappearing far-north edge of city maps, forms a halfhearted high street for the apartment dwellers clustered on its banks.
Public life happens in the Mayfair grocery store, and in a block-long stretch of sidewalk cafés and used-book stores.
The apartment buildings are old, and in some cases beautiful, like the Villa Carlotta, a late-nineteen-twenties Mediterranean-style structure designed by Arthur Harvey, where the architect Wallace Neff lived for many years.
Across from the Villa Carlotta is the avenue’s defining anomaly: a monumental turreted castle, also designed by Harvey, on a three-acre site, with formal gardens, a bubbling stream, a tennis court, and a pair of rubber trees that are more than a hundred years old.
Seven stories tall, the castle is an overgrown folly the color of farm cream, with swaying long-necked palms that seem to graze its roofs.
You want to circle the block and look at it,” Richardson Robertson III, a local architect, says.
Built as the Château Élysée, a long-term residential hotel for movie stars, it is considered by preservationists to be one of the city’s grandest Norman-revival buildings.
Since 1973, the Château Élysée has been owned by the Church of Scientology, which calls it Celebrity Centre.
Scientology, the religion that grew out of L.
Ron Hubbard’s popular self-help manual “Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,” incorporates aspects of Eastern philosophy, management theory, and science fiction—a genre in which Hubbard was prolific.
The first Scientology church was established in downtown Los Angeles, in 1954.
Although the Church’s spiritual headquarters are in Clearwater, Florida, and it has facilities around the world, Scientology is most deeply associated with Los Angeles and its entertainment industry.
A.
Hollywood and seventies-style art direction and signage.
At Celebrity Centre, where a large yellow sign affixed to a south-facing roof overlooking the 101 Freeway announces the building and its owner, this juxtaposition is especially acute.
Diane Kanner, an architectural historian who specializes in twentieth-century Los Angeles, calls the building Château Scientology.
From the outset, the conversion of celebrities was important to Scientology.
An internal newsletter produced by the Hubbard Communications Office, probably in the mid-fifties, asserts, “There are many to whom America and the world listens.
It goes on, “It is obvious what would happen to America if we helped its leaders to help others.
Project Celebrity is part of that program.
Though Scientology is not known to have had success with this early group, the movement now counts Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, and many other celebrities as members.
Celebrity Centre is used for Scientology courses and for “auditing,” a mainstay of the religion, in which a person undergoes a guided talk-therapy session, usually while holding a device known as an E-Meter, which is supposed to measure one’s spiritual state.
The goal is to eliminate “mental image pictures” associated with traumatic events; when a person is “Clear”—freed of all such associations—he can advance to the mystical and esoteric levels of Scientology.
Completion of the Bridge takes years, and each stage requires a cash investment.
An initial twelve-and-a-half-hour auditing session costs between six and seven hundred dollars, Greg LaClaire, a vice-president of Celebrity Centre, says.
In the Holiday 2007 Dianetics and Scientology catalogue, a deluxe Planetary Dissemination Edition E-Meter—billed as a “tool for Golden Age of Tech certainty,” to assist in “faster progress up The Bridge”—was offered, in “Diamond Blue,” for five thousand five hundred dollars.
On Celebrity Centre’s upper floors, there are thirty-nine hotel rooms to accommodate visiting Scientologists.
In the basement, there’s a drug detox facility.
The castle also fosters a feeling of community.
Hollywood’s not a very easy industry to bust into,” Hilary Royce, a former dancer who went to Sarah Lawrence and is now the director of community affairs for the Church of Scientology International, told me.
Any artist at Celebrity Centre would tell you it’s a safe place to study scripts, to network.
The promise of connectedness attracts many Hollywood hopefuls.
Celebrity Centre offers a range of Success in the Industry Seminars—Breaking Into Commercials, How to Get Cast in the Pilot Season, Hollywood Acting Class—which it promotes with flyers posted at auditions around town.
I stood in the foyer and watched this massive indoctrination presentation, where Marissa Ribisi, Juliette Lewis, and a casting director came out talking about how great it is to be in Scientology,” he said.
Then I was followed by auditors, who tried to get me to go into another room and get audited.
It was a pervasive, invasive type of sales pitch.
Those seminars are absolutely, utterly, entirely an introduction to Scientology,” Greg LaClaire told me.
But he said that he found the actor’s account otherwise suspect.
There’s so much interest in Scientology.
A longside glowing testimonials from people—celebrities and not—who credit Scientology for personal transformation, there are stories of savings spent, lives derailed, critics harassed.
Non-Scientologists tend to get a thrill from the aura of coercion and seduction—not to mention kitsch—that clings to the Church.
To them, the castle is a particular object of fascination, a magnificent confection that must not be tasted.
The offerings of its kitchen are another matter.
Celebrity Centre’s restaurant, the Renaissance, is open to anyone who cares to eat there.
A Hollywood producer, who asked that I not use her name in case she ever needs to deal with John Travolta’s agent, recalled a brunch at the Renaissance some years ago, attended by non-Scientologist movie executives, agents, directors, and actors.
Everyone was titillated,” the producer said.
In this case, she said, that meant some peculiar waiters, who repeatedly photographed them, rather than any recognizable celebrity.
After the brunch, the producer and her friends asked for a tour of the building, and were taken upstairs to a penthouse suite where, they were told, Ginger Rogers used to stay.
The room is totally tricked out,” the producer said.
As the tour moved on, the producer and her boyfriend dallied.
We actually considered getting on the bed and having sex.
I so wish that we had done that.
Two years ago, Julien Nitzberg, a writer and director, decided to have a fortieth-birthday dinner at the Renaissance.
His friend John Dutton, an architect, said that he was delighted at the chance to see the inside of the building.
I had always wanted to go there out of architectural curiosity, but you hear stories about people who go in and don’t come out,” he said.
It was a cold, dark night in early December.
The Christmas lights were going up.
It was like a theme park—well manicured and clean and very carefully arranged and designed,” Dutton recounted dreamily.
The Renaissance was nearly empty, the wine served warm.
The waiters seemed like actors impersonating waiters.
Dutton and his fiancée, not relishing being in the deserted building late at night, left right after dinner.
Others in the group went for a tour, and at the end were taken into separate rooms and asked if they would like to sign up for an introductory course.
Nitzberg recalled that one of the tour guides kept saying things like “Woooo, it’s so spooky, we’re Scientologists,” and wiggling his fingers at them.
Subject: I just hacked this computer.
We are locked in the Centre and can’t get out.
When I went to Celebrity Centre in December, for “Christmas Stories,” an annual variety show, which, like the Renaissance, is open to the public but attended mainly by Scientologists, I detected nothing more threatening than a familiar air of Hollywood clubbiness.
The stage, in a large iron-and-glass orangery known as the Garden Pavilion, was dressed to resemble the set of a nineteen-thirties radio show, with an electric “On Air” sign, a wide-mouthed fireplace stacked with logs and laden with red poinsettias, and a giant Christmas tree decorated with red and gold ornaments.
The audience, with the exception of a couple of heavily made-up women in slinky, discover-me!
NPR-listening folks.
Celebrity Centre’s song-and-dance troupe, Kids on Stage for a Better World.
Jenna Elfman came out dressed as an elf, in striped tights and a green hat, along with a pigtailed Kelly Preston, also in an elf costume; at the end of their skit, about being laid off by Santa, Ella Bleu Travolta  Preston’s daughter, with John Travolta  appeared, a confident child with glossy dark hair in a red hoodie, to tell them they could have their jobs back.
At intermission, cookies and hot cider were served.
The highlight of Act II was Kirstie Alley, in a formal green gown, making fat jokes while pretending to judge the Westminster Tree Show.
Proceeds from the tickets  seventy-five dollars for a reserved seat  benefitted the Hollywood Police Activities League, and went toward holiday gifts for underprivileged children in the neighborhood.
A newspaper story from 1928 announcing the plans for the Château Élysée reported, “A grassed moat will surround the building.
There were also six-paned casement windows and gargoyles in the eaves.
But the Gothic aura of the château, which cost just under a million dollars to construct, was always more than architectural.
The château was built by Eleanor Ince, on land she had owned with her husband, Thomas Ince, a silent-film pioneer who was known as the Father of the Western.
In the teens, the Inces homesteaded on the property in a one-story ranch house decorated with Indian headdresses and Western gear.
On Ince’s forty-third birthday, in 1924, he was invited onto William Randolph Hearst’s yacht, with Charlie Chaplin, Louella Parsons, Hearst, and Hearst’s girlfriend, Marion Davies.
While on board, Ince fell ill; he died at home a few days later.
Some time after Ince’s death, rumors emerged that Hearst had murdered him upon discovering him with Davies.
This sinister version of events, which includes the speculation that Eleanor built the Château Élysée with hush money from Hearst, was immortalized in Kenneth Anger’s “Hollywood Babylon,” and persists—promoted by noir tours of Hollywood—to the Ince family’s dismay.
People said that Hearst gave Eleanor the money,” Marc Wanamaker, a Hollywood historical consultant who has worked with the Inces, says.
No.
She was vice-president of Ince Studios and a partner in the business.
She sold the assets to friends and built the Château Élysée, where she lived in a big suite.
Throughout the thirties and forties, the château was an industry hangout.
Luminaries who stayed there include Errol Flynn, Carole Lombard, Katharine Hepburn, and Cary Grant, and the Church invokes its Hollywood lore proudly.
In the reception area of the Renaissance hangs a framed menu from 1937  creamed turnips, gooseberry cobbler, a filet-mignon dinner for a dollar-fifty , discovered in the attic by the building manager, Art Medeiros.
This was the dining room when Humphrey Bogart would’ve eaten here,” Medeiros told me.
It’s as if Falun Gong bought the Algonquin and advertised the gin Martinis that Dorothy Parker used to drink, but the Church’s emphasis on the entertainment industry has made the building’s transition to its current use seem almost logical.
The Church of Scientology bought the Château Élysée for a million dollars from a group affiliated with the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, which had been using it since the nineteen-fifties as a retirement home.
The building was run-down, with rebar poking through its shell, and, as studios moved to the valley and stars moved to Bel Air and the beach, the neighborhood, too, was becoming increasingly desolate.
The Church used volunteers and staff for the restoration.
L.
Church staff members who get out of line—is a volunteer program for self-improvement.
They get frequent breaks, eight hours of sleep, and three healthy meals,” he said.
F.
In the late eighties, the city designated the château a historic-cultural monument and effectively prevented the Church from gutting it.
I think somebody noticed that we were prettying it up, and that’s when the historians got involved,” Medeiros says.
The acquisition of the Château Élysée marked the beginning of a spending spree by the Church in Hollywood.
In 1977, it bought the expansive Art-Deco Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, near Silver Lake, and painted it a chalky azure color.
The complex, which comprises ten buildings on and around L.
Ron Hubbard Way—including the American Saint Hill Organization, a Scientology college—is known to Church members as Pacific Area Command.
Hollywood Boulevard, too, is a major stronghold.
In 1979, the Church bought the Christie Hotel, a 1923 Georgian-revival, and the adjacent lot, where the chic Club New Yorker, owned by the actor Jean Malin, used to be.
In the mid-eighties, the Church bought a 1923 bank building near Grauman’s Chinese, as an office for Author Services, a literary agency that manages the publication and translation of L.
Ron Hubbard’s work, and in 2000 it acquired the late-forties mission-style church next door.
In 1988 came the Guaranty Bank, a twelve-story 1925 Italianate Beaux-Arts building where Hedda Hopper once had an office.
Now it houses the L.
C.
David Miscavige, the most powerful figure to emerge in the Church since Hubbard’s death, in 1986.
Across the street is the former Regal Shoe store, a pinkish-beige nineteen-forties streamline-moderne structure, with papered-over and black-curtained windows, bought by the Church in 1996 and used by its in-house architecture-and-design team.
6 million on the El Cadiz, a gracious 1937 Spanish-style garden-apartment complex just off the boulevard.
Six months later, the city—perhaps concerned for the building’s fate—designated it a historic-cultural monument.
The boulevard is also marked by more covert references to the Church’s reach.
Scientology’s cosmology.
Shrouded in secrecy and said to be intended only for upper-level Operating Thetans, it involves a malevolent galactic warrior known as Xenu or Xemu.
In the seventies and eighties, the Church, despite its fortifying real-estate acquisitions, found itself besieged.
Dissatisfied former members alleged financial and psychological abuse; some asked for their money back.
Journalists wrote exposés.
Lawsuits abounded.
S.
L.
Ron Hubbard’s wife was sentenced to four years in prison for her role in the conspiracy.
But for the Church of Scientology, a new religion with limitless ambition and a sharp awareness of the importance of image, rehabilitating elegant old buildings serves both as a powerful means of repairing its reputation and as a tangible metaphor for that work.
It has spent tens of millions of dollars on seismic upgrades and historic restoration of its Hollywood properties, and would have spent far more had it paid market rates.
The exteriors of its buildings are spotless, and many of them are watched over by twenty-four-hour cameras and security guards.
They do it to enhance their visual status,” Robert W.
Nudelman, the director of preservation at Hollywood Heritage, told me.
By the time the Church began to buy on Hollywood Boulevard, most other investors had fled, and the street belonged to dealers, runaways, and bums.
Tourists came on coaches, saw the Walk of Fame, and got straight back on the bus.
The Church of Scientology was one of the few things going; often, in those days, theirs were the only lights on after dark.
Meanwhile, the Church worked to identify itself with the dream-factory aspect of Hollywood, both through its celebrity adherents and by promoting L.
Ron Hubbard’s gig, in the late thirties, as a writer of pre-feature cliffhangers and serials.
It made little difference to the Church that Hollywood the neighborhood no longer had much to do with the entertainment industry.
Hollywood’s blessing and its curse is that it’s always been at once a place and an ideal,” Eric Garcetti, the city-council member who represents Hollywood, says.
The Church of Scientology has always made those two things synonymous in its work.
They consciously draw on the glamour of old Hollywood.
Nowadays, the Scientologists are part of the local establishment.
The Church has hosted Chamber of Commerce mixers in its buildings; it helps out with an annual police- and fire-department barbecue, has a representative on the board of the Hollywood Arts Council and another on the board of the local business-improvement district, and maintains a strong presence in the Hollywood Thanksgiving-weekend parade.
During the Christmas season, the lot next to the Christie is fashioned into “Winter Wonderland,” a display with a towering fir tree and a resident Santa Claus on a faux-snow-and-glitter-encrusted set.
The longer they’re here, the more credibility they have and the more respect,” Leron Gubler, who runs the Chamber of Commerce, says.
Kip Rudd, a senior planner at a city-redevelopment agency which came into Hollywood in the eighties to spur investment, says, “The Scientologists were the jewels along the boulevard in terms of keeping it vital.
Last year, the Los Angeles Business Journal gave the Church an award for adaptive reuse.
Other developers, encouraged by friendly politicians and incentives, have followed the Church’s lead.
There’s no question that people saw the beauty of old Hollywood in the buildings that they own and maintain,” Garcetti says.
The Broadway Hollywood, on the eastern end of the boulevard, a luxury apartment building whose interiors were designed by Kelly Wearstler, recently opened in an old department store.
Night clubs have moved into the old storefronts and are attracting movie stars again.
A W hotel is under construction.
Hilary Royce, Scientology’s community liaison, says that other property owners on the boulevard have come to the Church for advice about how to renovate their buildings.
We were some of the first people restoring our buildings to their original grandeur,” she told me.
The Renaissance is directly on the right, in a delicately proportioned main room with an enclosed terrace.
One afternoon in December, after an extensive tour of Scientology properties, I went to the Renaissance for lunch with Royce, Adams, and Greg LaClaire, of Celebrity Centre.
It was past two, and the place was empty, except for Girard, a lugubrious French maître d’, and a pale young woman pouring ice water.
We sat on the terrace, in carved-wood chairs with upholstered backs and seats, reproductions of the reproduction Louis XIV furniture found in the Château Élysée.
I ordered lobster salad, and watched a security guard on a bike turn circles near a babbling fountain on the winter-brown lawn.
A radio played fuzzy Christmas music.
The Scientologists set about explaining the special role of the artist in society, and how, by enhancing the lives of artists, the Church enhances culture as a whole.
Royce mentioned that Hubbard had written on this subject, and excused herself from the table.
She returned a few minutes later with a dusty green book, “Organization Executive Course, Public Division, Volume 6,” part of a series written by Hubbard that is used in the management and standardization of all areas of Church activity.
She looked momentarily flummoxed, and began flipping through the pages, perhaps searching for something more ennobling.
After a few more attempts, she closed the cover and set it down beside me.
I opened the book.
The pages were copies of typed memos by Hubbard.
After a few moments, Royce took the book away, saying that I could find more helpful information in the glossy Celebrity Centre brochure.
Outside, a woman in work pants and a beige shirt maneuvered a wheelbarrow over a little bridge leading toward the Garden Pavilion.
Now she elaborated.
Here’s the big picture with Scientology and Dianetics,” she said.
The religion is expanding and expanding and there’s a particular public and that public has needs.
Celebrities are just a special public.
They are.
She rambled on a bit, before returning to her original point.
The celebrity is a special public,” she said.
Art Medeiros, the building manager, met us in the dining room and showed me molding, hand-painted in pastel colors by Church members, which he said had been refashioned from fragments found at the site.
Hand-painted images of theatre masks, music stands, and dancing slippers decorated the walls.
We restored this room to be like the palace in Versailles,” he said.
We sent a couple of our designers to France and they went to châteaus and hotels.
They found that things were very eclectic in Europe, so we re-created that here.
The renovations in this room added a lot more details and colors and stuff—before, it was a lot plainer.
This was the first room to be done, in ’87.
It was a prototype for the rest.
The historians loved this room.
The Scientologists improve upon the past in the spirit of Sir Arthur Evans reconstructing the Palace of Knossos—call in the carpenters, fresco the walls, and suddenly the old heap looks like something.
We walked down the hall—triple-coated with pink, cream, and salmon paint, applied to the walls with sea sponge—to the former lobby, where Church artisans had painted the ceiling with a trompe-l’oeil landscape of ancient columns dripping with vines.
The walls were hung with colorful posters and flat-screen televisions playing videos to illustrate the major principles of Scientology.
In a corner, near a roaring fire, was an E-Meter.
I saw lots of people in their twenties and thirties, casually but deliberately dressed, streaming downstairs, like college students let out of class, or gathered at a small outdoor café, smoking.
I recognized Patrick Renna—Frosty—but no one else.
In front of the elevator, there was a long-haired kid in expensive skate-inspired clothes, talking on a cell phone.
Maybe he will be famous someday.
We took the elevator to the fourth floor, where the walls were decorated with paintings made by Scientologists in the style of seventeenth-century portraits.
Medeiros let us into No.
407, a suite with a large living room, a kitchen, and a bedroom up a flight of stairs.
Kirstie Alley designed this suite,” he said.
Bronze-and-blue Chinese toile wallpaper ran through the living room and kitchen and covered the hood of the oven.
A porcelain statuette of an Asian woman formed the base of a lamp with a square bell shade.
The kitchen cabinets were original, and painted white.
A small-tiled sink was new but probably historically accurate, except for the metallic color of some of the tiles.
She went for gold,” Medeiros said.
Upstairs, in the bedroom, there were silver-gelatin prints of Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, Rudolph Valentino.
The floors were bamboo, in keeping with the Asian theme.
Tasselled floor-to-ceiling drapes in robin’s-egg blue were drawn back to reveal a green landscape of treetops and fronds.
The late-afternoon sun made the Villa Carlotta and its tile roof glow orange.
The Hollywood sign was visible high up on the hill.
I stood there and tried to fix it in my mind.
It was likely the best view of it I’ll ever get.

The Scientology religion contains workable answers to the problems people face in their lives.
The subject matter of Scientology is all life.
It contains practical means through which predictable improvement can be obtained in any area to which it is applied.
Scientology recognizes that man is not just so many vials of chemicals fortuitously combined into a remarkable stimulus-response machine.
Scientology views man as a spiritual being with native capabilities which can be improved far beyond what is generally believed possible.
In fact, it has been demonstrated that man deteriorates to the degree that he denies his spiritual nature and ceases to live with moral values, such as trust, honesty, integrity and other sometimes intangible characteristics.
By seeing man as essentially spiritual, Scientology follows in the traditional view of man and his relationship to the universe.
Scientology, however, is unique in that it contains practical means of enabling man to resolve his material concerns and so come to achieve his spiritual aspirations.
In this regard Scientology is an improvement over any earlier practice in terms of what it can actually do to help man.
The problems of drugs, education, morals, relationships, trust and others contain solutions in Scientology which do not beget further problems.
The situations to which Scientology can be applied are as varied as human activity itself.
If a child cannot read well and is falling behind the rest of the class, Scientology study technology can help dispense with a liability that would otherwise affect the rest of his or her life.
With Scientology, many, many marriages have been saved and strengthened.
The emphasis in Scientology is on the application of exact methodologies in order to bring about change in the conditions of an individual’s life.
The aim of Scientology is to put a person into a condition where he can be more self-determined about living a happier, more fulfilling life.
We are all involved in some sort of communication in our day-to-day lives, but the real meaning of communication is what I learned in the online course.
By definition, I only knew that communication means getting across ideas and information to another person and for communication to take place, it should originate from an individual and be transmitted to another who receives it and acknowledges it.
After completing this course, I learned the real purpose and importance of communication.
I learned not only how to communicate effectively, but also how to get myself recognized by using an effective means of communication.
I have also learned the cycles of one-way and two-way communication.
This course definitely helped me to improve my work efficiency.
I am a secretary in the healthcare sector and communication is one of my main duties.
It was really of great benefit and was truly a great experience completing this course.
K.
Scientology offers practical solutions to help you improve conditions in your life and the lives of those around you.

Combined, these chapters provide all the tools you need to confront and resolve virtually any life situation: from resolving marital strife to recovering a friend from drugs and managing a company for optimum success.
There can be no purpose worth contemplating which does not include happiness and experience.
L.
Millions of people all over the world have used Scientology to improve their lives and help their fellows.
This handbook contains the basic Scientology principles and methods most often employed to help people get along better in interpersonal relationships, be more successful in their work, improve their family life, and effectively help their friends, family and associates do the same.
Scientology does not require that one change his or her beliefs or convictions to use it successfully.
All you have to do is apply the data and observe for yourself whether or not it works.
You as you are now, can do more good for yourself and for those around you than you ever imagined, and gain enormous personal satisfaction doing it.

Screenshot from Mark Rathbun s video.
A former executive of the Church of Scientology said three members of the church’s top management ambushed him at Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday morning, and that he has video footage to prove it.
The video, in which top Scientology leaders are seen yelling obscenities, is the first public glimpse of the secretive church’s top management in four years.
Mark Rathbun, a former senior executive of the Church of Scientology who has been an outspoken critic since quitting in 2004, said he had just cleared security at the airport when the three ambushed him.
The video “affords a very rare glimpse at the personalities who are actually running Scientology at the highest levels,” Rathbun told International Business Times.
According to him, Scientology’s top leaders have not been seen in public since appearing on CNN in 2010.
No one has seen hide nor hair of them since,” Rathbun said.
During his 27-career in the church, Rathbun became one of the top leaders.
He said he was responsible for “auditing,” a procedure practiced by some of the most high-profile members, including actor Tom Cruise.
In 2009 , Rathbun told the St.
Petersburg Times of Florida that top management physically abused colleagues to demonstrate loyalty to Miscavige.
In 2010 he appeared on CNN’s  Anderson Cooper 360  and described similar incidents.
He has also produced several documentaries about the church, wrote the book “Memoirs of a Scientology Warrior” that appeared last year, and runs a blog .
Rathbun said a recent lawsuit may have been the trigger for the latest incident.
His wife Monique, who is not a Scientologist, filed suit against Miscavige charging she was harassed by the church for four years.
I believe they were attempting to incite me to assault one of them so that they could arrange an arrest to discredit me,” Rathbun said about the incident he documented on video.
A request for comment from the Church of Scientology had not been answered by the time of publication.
The organization has a reputation for litigiousness.
Since its inception in 1953 the church has launched numerous intellectual property suits, religious discrimination suits, and libel suits.
Ex-members have also brought lawsuits against the church, alleging it has been involved in human trafficking , forced labor, fraud and misrepresentation.
This isn’t the first time, Rathbun said, he has experienced intimidation tactics by church executives.
In 2011 , members of the church appeared at Rathbun’s house in Corpus Christi, Texas, armed with video cameras.
During that encounter, Rathbun lost his temper and grabbed one of the microphones.
They know how to discern our travel plans in advance as we have been confronted by, or been overtly tailed by private investigators, nearly every time we arrive in another city at the airport,” Rathbun said.
He said the Church of Scientology has not contacted him since Sunday s video appeared on YouTube, where it has garnered 340,000 views so far.
Wolfram Alpha is a pretty handy extension for solving explaining complicated math problems  and simple ones too .
On March 13, 2003, Jeremy Perkins, a 28 year old untreated schizophrenic, stabbed his mother Elli 77 times .
She bled to death on her bedroom floor.
Jeremy is currently being held at Rochester Psychiatric Center, having been found not responsible for Elli s murder by reason of mental disease or defect.
Perkins, his mother and father, his sister, and her husband are all members of the Church of Scientology, a group that believes modern psychiatric medicine derives from an ancient alien civilization s plot to drug and enslave humanity.
Scientologists like Tom Cruise vehemently and publicly oppose the pharmacological treatment of mental illness.
Unfortunately, Scientology s own brand of therapy, called  auditing , is worthless.
Elli Perkins was a senior auditor  counselor  at the Church of Scientology of Buffalo, New York .
Her son-in-law, Jeff Carlson, was the Executive Director of that church.
Jeremy himself had taken Scientology courses there, and was even flown out to Los Angeles to join Scientology s paramilitary Sea Organization, although he was promptly sent back home due to his mental problems.
After consulting a Scientologist osteopath, Dr.
Conrad Maulfair, Elli was treating Jeremy with vitamins, which he disliked.
Within hours of Elli s murder, which occurred on L.
Ron Hubbard s birthday, the Church of Scientology initiated a crash cover-up to hide its connections to the case.
Jeremy s family has since  disconnected  from him, per Scientology policy.
This web site reveals Scientology s true role in the death of Elli Perkins and the destruction of Jeremy s life.

10 10 - a perfect response to idiots like this.
For the 60th time.
I love this guy.
I took their personality test at a center here in Tampa and can assure you, probably 8 years ago, their actions are all strategic.
It s a bunch of psych bullshit to make you feel like you are inferior to them.
When I got my results, after waiting an hour and trying to leave, they would say  you re results are just about ready  and  if you didn t care about the results you wouldn t still be here .
Then when they read off the results, everything was a backhanded compliment.
It s something very hard to miss.
Ahh OK, Great idea.
Ill start by posting this video.
Ideally, the best response would be a genuine one that demonstrates that you could not possibly care any less than you currently do.
Mostly it involves going about your business without outright ignoring the other person.
Acknowledgment combined with total indifference.
The challenge in executing this response is that it requires a genuine feeling of indifference.
As if the person had asked you what time it was.
It requires a belief structure that stops your fight or flight response from ever kicking in.
It means never feeling that you have something to prove to anyone but yourself.
A lot of people can fake this really well but it s never as convincing as when it s real.
It always has that hint of defensiveness.
Saying things like,  U mad bro,  if intended to anger the other guy,  shows them that you care that they were trying to get under your skin.
However, if you really could not care any less  on the inside , the other person is going to know it.
They will feel it.
While the intended goal is not to make the other person feel powerless over you  because you don t care whether or not they feel that way , it has that effect.
It is absolutely crippling to their ego.
Part of the training Scientologists pay for gives them the ability to speak at a person without any regard to the behavior or words of the target.
Their eyes look empty because, when they want to overpower someone in conversation, they aren t looking at the target s eyes.
They re focusing on a point far behind that person while keeping the person s face in that line of sight.
It s meant to make the target feel insignificant and overwhelmed.
They are taught to speak without being flustered by their own messages or the words and actions of the target.
It starts with ridding of all awkward feelings when facing another person.
They know how to look at people, unblinking, and not feel anything.
They progress to training which teaches this lack of emotion while saying crazy things.
Part of their lessons involve Alice in Wonderland readings, which are silly by nature.
This video explains what they do .
While it s a classic behavior of a higher-level member of the organization, Scientologists aren t the only people to use these techniques.
Drill Instructors can do these sorts of things, but the intent is not to harass people outside of military training.
Scientologists use this to dominate people wherever they go.
EDIT: This isn t necessarily a negative thing.
Anyone who s ever practiced a speech for a large audience is essentially using the same techniques.
The point is to maintain the attention of your audience without stumbling.
To use those techniques on individuals for domination that s wrong here.
These people are kinda sad.
Wow, really pulling out their top material there.
Also, the whole secret police spiriting away dissenters thing.
I m not saying dianetics is a secret nazi manefesto, but isn t it weird that nobody is denying that claim?
He s probably very intimidating to a little league team.
He s probably very intimidating to a little league team.
Where do you think he learned to chomp on his Big League Chew like that?
Wait, so can we expect some legal justice to follow up?
Operation Snow White was the Church of Scientology s internal name for a major criminal conspiracy during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L.
Ron Hubbard.
These guys don t fuck around.
I have NO idea why the government hasn t yet pulled RICO and torn these guys apart.
More than anything, this is what you should worry about.
I protested them back in 2008 and they sent me a certified letter with a DVD called  Anonymous  Hate Crimes.  That didn t stop me, but their point was to show me that they knew where I lived, etc.
They will go to your boss and spread lies about you.
Several people had their tires slashed at protests.
However, they are most well known for bankrupting dissenters by claiming  hate speech  against their religion.
They re like radical islamists, but with the law on their side.
I was at a couple of the  08 protests  their HQ was is 30 minutes away from my house- Clearwater .
Some friends of mine were followed after the first protest, and got letters or some shit that didn t amount to anything.
Most of our group had our faces covered with bandanas; the one guy who didn t worked with the USAF under a basic security clearance, and pretty much wanted them to run a background check on him because apparently trying to dox someone who has a clearance gets you a warning from some agency that cares about shit like that.
They re an asshole troll religion with too much money.
90% of their bullshit is posturing.
2 which would be entertaining.
Maybe even worth a flight back home for a vacation and some free protest pizza to eat while listening to the 90th replay of Fresh Prince of Bellair.
As I m sure nearly everyone has seen on TIL at least once, they actually hired people to spy and background check both Trey Parker and Matt Stone, but found nothing they could use because they are just normal guys.
And of course Issac Hayes left after that Scientology episode.
So I guess the Scientologists win!
Yeah, well, that s the thing, it was all dirt, all the way down.
Dirty great heapings of shit just lying around everywhere.
This guy Mark Bunker* is a real hero.
He has dozens of videos documenting how scientologists have been harassing him for years for attempting to expose them.
He s teamed up with ex members to uncover their operation.
They absolutely HATE him.
If he wasn t relatively independently wealthy he wouldn t have been able to do this for so long.
EDIT: If you want to see how far Scientology will go to ruin you, and to appreciate Bunker all the more, google Bob Minton, who was one of Bunker s closest allies and was frequently in his videos picketing the CoS until they got to him and forced him to turn on the critics.
Sadistic wanks.
Remember it s an organization whose members join because they feel like they might need some psychological help.
Then they are denied medicine or access to help and emotionally abused until they die or run out of money.
They literally aren t allowed to interact with regular people, and probably have no way to gauge their communication skills.
I believe one of the lawsuits brought up was about a woman on their sea-org thing who hadn t been allowed to talk for 3 years and slept in a closet after working 100 hours a week with no days off.
Imagine what that would do to your brain when you started trying to talk to someone again.
Weiiiiiird.
Scientology isn t outlawed in Germany, they just don t get any kind of foothold whatsoever.
Fascists are fascists, we don t like any of their kind.
Proselytising doesn t fall under freedom of religion, in Germany, and the  tech  is banned from any government contract and any company that has any kind of sense.
One of my favorite Vanity Fair articles of all time.
These are classic cult tactics.
Just be wary because this behavior crops up in other ideologies.
If you don t think it s infected yours, then you probably need to look a little harder.
If you re ever in a group, say you re leaving or joining the opposition.
Then see how people react.
It will tell you a lot about the people you are with.
Why?
Why would you want to leave?
You re selfish for doing this.
Fuck, you.
You were worthless anyway.
No one ever liked you.
In fact we made fun of you behind your back.
And that is when you know you ve won.
The leader, Miscavige, beats and verbally abuses his employees.
Confessional  auditing sessions  are recorded for later use.
Blackmail and such.
Or just watching and laughing at people s problems.
Esp.
HOW CAN ANYONE STILL BE IN THIS CULT?
Also, this guy is still a Scientologist, just not practicing in the  Church .
He s a  squirrel  as they say: a scientologist who uses L.
Ron Hubbard s  teachings  outside the church.
And they hate that.
Sorry for all the  quotes .
2: I ve been informed that he is no longer a Squirrel.
Which is good.
L.
Ron Hubbard should be relegated to the dustbin of history.

I first became aware of what the Church of Scientology was when I was 4.
My friends would be playing outside, but my parents kept taking me to these meetings.
They d go off to do whatever adult Scientologists do, and us kids would be shuffled off to an empty room to play, but without any distracting  toys,   books,  or  supervising adults  to get in the way.
Yes, Scientology s answer to Sunday school is to lock all the kids up together.
Even as a 4-year-old, I suspected that this wasn t the healthiest way to treat small children.
The room seems foreboding in my memories: Only the barest amount of natural light graced us through the tiny windows, and the teenagers they left in charge weren t exactly child-care pros.
They wouldn t even let my baby sister go to the bathroom.
Also?
No food .
My mom had to hide food in our pockets so we didn t starve while she spent hours in their meeting.
Oh, and they actually locked all the doors into and out of these meetings.
We had to leave early for a doctor s appointment once, and my mom realized this fact rather suddenly when she found she couldn t get out of the service.
The whole congregation had been locked inside.
So, you know, good thing there wasn t a fire.
L.
Ron had no fear of fire, for he was flame incarnate.
Scientology  schools  are another mess altogether.
They place a lot of emphasis on something called word clearing.
L.
Ron Hubbard believed that misunderstood words were quite literally the only possible way for a child to lose interest in a subject at school.
Nerdy kids who read during math class can attest to the absurdity of this claim, but it s a lynchpin of Scientologist tech   tech  is Scientology s equivalent to scripture, crossed with the owner s manual for a 1994 Buick Century .
So if you go to a Scientologist school, you can look forward to a lot of time with your dictionary.
One of the kids my family knew wasn t very good at his dictionary reading.
He had trouble reading at all, or even making out diagrams on the blackboard.
He was held back for three years because he just couldn t hack the coursework.
Eventually his mom took him to the optometrist, and surprise, the kid was desperately in need of glasses.
Somehow Hubbard s tech failed to account for that possibility.
E-meters make notoriously bad contact lenses.
4.
Scientology s answer to first aid is something called touch assist .
Imagine you re a little kid who just scraped your knee.
They ll take you to a quiet room, lay you down, and touch you on various parts of your body.
So they ll touch you with a finger and say  Feel my finger,  and you ll say  I can feel it.  Gradually that finger gets closer and closer to the injured spot.
After like a half hour, they ll finally reach your knee.
By that point, the injury should have healed.
Look, everyone!
Scientologists aren t real big fans of modern medicine in general.
My little sister once got sick for two months.
Since I was of age to be a guardian for her at that point, I took her to the doctor during one of the days my mom had custody.
I lied and told her dad  my stepdad  I was taking her shopping.
Because that s terribly sad, have this incredibly racist pulp illustration of an old Hubbard story.
The doctor prescribed penicillin, which she was supposed to take three times a day, but my sister insisted that her dad wasn t going to let her take it.
She was crying her eyes out, because that s what sick kids do when they think someone s going to steal their medicine.
My mom thought that was shit.
I don t really know what was said, but she put the fear of God Xenu in him.
He didn t give my sister any shit for taking her pills, but he made damn sure to take me aside and let me know what an awful person I was for going behind his back like that.
Another time, I went to a friend s house for a play date.
My friend wound up cutting her toe on a rake, and the family, who were Scientologists, just washed the cut out with water.
It got severely infected, but none of the Scientologists around her would let her go to the doctor.
It wasn t until the wound started to smell weird and she stopped being able to walk that they finally tried something besides touch assist.
Thankfully,  actual fucking medicine assist  proved moderately more useful.
The doctor took one look and declared her a day or two away from blood poisoning.
This girl nearly lost her foot because none of the adults taking care of her thought to sterilize her wound.
Jehovah s Witnesses won t take blood transfusions, but I m pretty sure they re down with putting rubbing alcohol on a cut before it turns fucking septic.
3.
When a close friend of our family turned 16, she joined the church group known as the Sea Org, so named because it was founded to, among other things, operate a series of naval vessels .
Basically the Org exists to maintain church structures in exchange for free room and board and the chance to pretend you re a member of a space navy.
As it turns out, being the thin line between the rest of the world and chaos doesn t net a great benefits package.
The conditions for Org members are pretty messed up -- my friend got sick on their diet of rice and beans  and nothing else .
She wound up too weak to move, or even eat.
And if you read the previous entry, you know how this was handled.
See, Scientologists use something called the tone scale to determine your emotional state by your voice.
Since my friend was  low  tone, no one was allowed to talk to her.
They didn t even come to check on her when she was sick.
So, a 16-year-old spent several days stuck on her bathroom floor, unable to move or cry for help.
According to Scientology, the whole  being deathly ill  thing was her fault anyway -- if she d been following her tech, she couldn t possibly have fallen ill, damn it!
Sadly, no one considered mixing this tech with some bed rest and antibiotics.
Another girl I knew joined the Sea Org at 14.
She was shipped off to Florida near Flag, the Church of Scientology s headquarters.
They put her to work on a construction project but refused to follow silly ol  rules about wearing hard hats or any kind of protective gear at all.
My friend wound up getting knocked in her helmetless head and hospitalized.
She was actually sort of lucky, because as you can guess, the Sea Org doesn t usually allow its members to see doctors.
When I was 7 or 8, the Sea Org tried to recruit me.
This nice lady in a smart uniform asked me and a friend if we wanted to join the Org when we came of age.
We said  Sure!  The recruiter took us into the back room and handed us a pair of billion-year contracts   seriously  , set to begin in a few years.
My friend and I signed with our left hands, operating on the child logic that our signatures wouldn t count if we didn t sign with our right hands.
With our luck, our membership will finally expire just in time for us to see the sun go supernova and swallow the Earth.
Choosing to  Like  Cracked has no side effects, so what s the worst that could happen?

Could Scientology help save Flint?
City Council considers endorsing L.
L.
FLINT, MI -- The City Council might endorse a program authored by Scientology creator L.
Ron Hubbard, a  nonreligious moral code  that some councilmembers think could help change Flint s violent culture.
Councilwoman Monica Galloway.
Flint has suffered for decades from high rates of violent crime, poverty and blight, leaving officials on the lookout for help, possibly including  The Way to Happiness,  a program based on a 73-page, pocket-sized book of Hubbard s writings.
Scientologist Monika Biddle asked council members on Wednesday, Aug.
22, to consider endorsing the program as a way to help introduce the ideas to the Flint area.
His 1948 book   Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,   sold millions of copies.
Scientology is aimed at promoting mental and spiritual health by training adherents to overcome the aftereffects of past traumas, including those believed to have been experienced in previous lifetimes.
Through the use of what has been termed an E-meter, somewhat like a lie detector, church members undergo exercises and counseling to eliminate negative mental images and achieve a   clear state,   according to the church.
Biddle presented council members with information from the  The Way to Happiness,  distributing the booklet and showing several public service announcements during Wednesday s committee meeting.
I think it s a good deal, yes,  Police Chief James Tolbert said of the program.  From the information I ve seen, apparently it works.
Tolbert said he met Biddle, who is not from Genesee County, during a conference and said she has already met with Mayor Dayne Walling and emergency manager Darnell Earley.
MLive-The Flint Journal could not reach Biddle Friday, Aug.
22, but some council members said public service announcements that reinforce messages like,  Do not murder, Don t Do Anything Illegal, and Do Not Steal,  can t hurt the city.
Biddle suggested Flint officials investigate  The Way to Happiness  programs in St.
The Way to Happiness Foundation web site says the organization was established as a resource center to assist the public in reversing  the current moral decline  and says about 100 million copies of  The Way to Happiness  have been distributed in more than 97 languages and in more than 170 countries.
The foundation web site says communities can deal with a lack of moral values and crime by distributing  The Way to Happiness  book or book-on-film to offenders to get them back on the right track.
The group suggests police officers give the book to members of the community, to neighborhood watch groups and those involved in community policing; get  The Way to Happiness  public service announcements played for youth groups, schools, after-school programs and detention centers; and get educators using the booklet in tutoring and mentoring programs.

What s at this site?
The badass star of films like Cape Fear and Natural Born Killers opens up about her memorable roles, new film Kelly & Cal, and her Scientology conspiracy theories.
Juliette Lewis has finally come full-circle.
Twenty years after portraying Mallory Knox, one-half of a deranged murder-happy couple in Oliver Stone’s highly controversial satire Natural Born Killers, the 41-year-old actress-turned-punk rocker will star as a hard-boiled detective  alongside Ryan Phillippe  solving a murder in the ABC series Secrets & Lies, which will premiere in early 2015.
Lewis.
It’s one of several upcoming projects for the refreshingly unique actress who, in recent years, had been focusing a bit more on her musical efforts  first, as front woman of Juliette and the Licks, and then a solo artist  over acting.
But first comes her excellent turn in Kelly & Cal, opening in theaters Sept.
19.
Directed by Jen McGowan, the film stars Lewis as Kelly—former singer for the punk group Wetnap who experiences an “existential crisis” when she gives birth to a child.
Fearful of her transition to boring suburban mom wife, she strikes up a strange relationship with Cal  Jonny Weston , her 16-year-old neighbor in a wheelchair.
Lewis candidly discussed her career, the legacy of Natural Born Killers, why the mainstream media will never give Scientology a fair shake, and much more.
There seems to be a lot of you in the character of Kelly.
Well, I guess Jen McGowan and the writer, Amy Lowe Starbin, said that they had me in mind, but they don’t know my pain, and they don’t know my inner struggles.
Even though I’m not a new mother like Kelly is, I was going through a similar existential crisis.
It’s gotten better, but I guess I’m still going through it—where you question all the things that drove you when you were younger and how those things aren’t going to sustain you in mid-life, and you find yourself reflecting, and feeling lost.
What were you struggling with?
I think the big thing, for me, is facing my parents’ mortality.
That is horrifying, and I’m still dealing with it.
There’s just so much wrapped up in it.
My Dad is older and has Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and it’s taken me seven years to accept it—and I still haven’t accepted it.
I was going through that, and with my band, I’d been playing music for six years, but I realized that I still loved acting, storytelling, and characters, so that was doing my head in because I didn’t know how to balance both.
I was struggling to strike a balance.
Hollywood can be unwelcoming to women as they age.
Did that very unfortunate reality factor in to your struggle?
With age, there’s definitely that stuff.
But I don’t think so, because I’ve tried to stay pretty disengaged from the politics of Hollywoodism.
I’ve always been an outsider.
I’ve always been attracted to roles that would challenge me, and that wouldn’t come around very often.
I sort of got lucky in that I was able to carve a niche for myself.
I haven’t made a career off my looks, thank God, but hopefully how I’ve moved people emotionally, the directors I’ve been able to work with, and the stories I’ve been a part of.
There is a great in-joke in the film where your character is pleasuring herself to George Clooney’s Rolling Stone cover, and of course you two starred in From Dusk Till Dawn together.
OK, that has such a cute story to it.
That was written in the movie, and a few months prior I’d just done August: Osage County, which he produced.
I hadn’t talked to George in years, so it was really easy to reach him having just done August.
You have to get the rights approved to the picture, so I emailed George and said, “Hey!
I’m doing a beautiful little indie and there’s a scene where the girl looks longingly at your image…” I didn’t say, “I’m going to be masturbating with a dildo to your face,” but I’m sure he wouldn’t have minded that, either.
Anyway, he gave his approval!
You probably don’t get enough credit for this, but you’re a Cassandra of sorts when it comes to starring in movies with future A-list hunks on the cusp of superstardom.
Yeah, this is now part of my history that I can say we all came up together—Brad, Leo, Johnny Depp, George Clooney.
It’s so funny.
And you’re thinking, “Dude!
Are you kidding?
It’s amazing to think that it was even a question.
You’re a Scientologist.
What do you think are the biggest misconceptions about Scientology?
The thing about Scientology is it is anti-drug in that you’re seeking relationship or communication tools—simple basics on how to live better.
So, when Tom came out about that, I’ve never seen someone get torn down so hard, and they still brutalize him with Scientology pieces to this day.
It’s a religious philosophy and self-help movement.
And you’ll never see a truthful word written about it in mainstream media.
Now, many of your films have aged really well, which I think is the true barometer for success.
But then, I remember that when I was younger I was listening to music from the ’60s.
And in the ’90s, with the exception of The Pixies, I was listening to trippy music from two decades prior.
Although you did cover some PJ Harvey songs in Strange Days.
How amazing is that?
It was Kathryn Bigelow who directed that, and she is who hipped me to PJ Harvey.
I didn’t know about her until Kathryn introduced me.
Your first big splash was in Cape Fear, and that auditorium scene between you and De Niro is beyond creepy to this day.
It is creepy.
They were so upset at the character for standing there and chatting.
I read that you developed a crush on De Niro during the making of Cape Fear?
Well… look at him.
He’s beautiful.
All sun-kissed from the Florida sunshine… But I think it was more of a creative crush.
I had someone who was treating me as an equal, and I cannot tell you enough how important it was working with De Niro and Marty.
They validated my instincts and I was all instinct—because I didn’t go to any acting school.
That was just fuckin’ magic.
Looking back on Natural Born Killers, there aren’t too many female protagonists like Mallory Knox.
She’s just a pure badass who is every bit Mickey’s equal.
I wanted to fill her with pain and primal rage, which was really fun for me.
I love talking about that movie—especially in hindsight, because I didn’t appreciate it enough at the time.
It was pretty shrouded in controversy, with a bunch of “copycat” murders having been blamed on the film.
Thankfully, the case was thrown out.
That is a lawyer’s wet dream.
If you could place blame on entertainment for all the crimes people commit, you’d be in court all the livelong day.
I love that movie.
I got to do street fighting and shoot all these guns before I got the part, and I’d never shot a gun before.
Now, people think I’m all violent when I’m quite the opposite.
Oliver was so funny.
He didn’t tell me for months that I’d gotten the part and he’d call me into his office and say, “I want to see you do pull-ups,” and he’d put a pull-up bar in his doorway.
I want to say I got to about 10 pull-ups… but I probably only got to seven!
At around noon yesterday, The Atlantic posted an advertorial package for the Church of Scientology .
The promotional piece spoke of Scientology’s growth and the key role of the church’s “ecclesiastical leader,” David Miscavige.
Its timing was not curious, in that it hit the Atlantic site just days before the release of an exhaustive investigative book by the New Yorker’s Lawrence Wright on Scientology .
Whatever the timing of the advertorial, it took a rough ride on the Internet yesterday and is now gone from the Atlantic’s site.
The piece was classified as “sponsor content,” hardly a novel approach to generating online revenue.
Native ads are critical to The Atlantic’s livelihood.
They are one element of digital advertising revenue, which in 2012 accounted for a striking 59 percent of the brand’s overall advertising revenue haul.
Unclear just how much of the digital advertising revenue stems from sponsor content.
We’re working on that.
Though the Atlantic has done many such advertorial packages in the past, Raabe says that it hasn’t received complaints — at least that she’s aware of.
This is the first such package that The Atlantic has done with Scientology.
Comments!
Commentators sniffed close moderation of the comments on the Scientology piece.
Here’s some history on the topic: Advertorial sponsors in the past haven’t always opted to activate comments on their posts, according to Raabe.
Makes a lot of sense, given all the abuse that can pile up in that territory, not to mention the labor required to clean it all up.
The outcry over the Scientology post trickled up to the level of the Atlantic’s president, M.
Scott Havens.

Basically its a falsetto  religion  in which eternal happiness is attained by donating all of your money to the leaders.
Founded by L.
Ron Hubbard as a way to scheme money and make a fast buck off his books.
One of the  holiest  days in this religion is Hubbard s birthday.
Because most celebrites such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta are too stupid to realize it, they belong to this group.
A cult founded by science fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard.
This area of the galaxy was once ruled by an alien warlord named Xenu.
65 million years ago his empire was overpopulated horribly, so to combat the overpopulation he had trillions of citizens called in for psychiatric evalutations and tax audits, where they were given paralytic drugs, loaded onto space planes, and flown to Planet Teegeeack.
Once on this planet, their bodies were stacked in huge piles around volcanoes, while atom bombs were dropped into these volcanos, instantly killing trillions of galactic citizens.
To keep these people from reincarnating in the rest of the galaxy, Xenu set up a special trap.
Powerful force-fields kept their souls  called  Thetans  in Scientology jargon  from escaping, and these thetans were then shown special holographic movies about the various lies they are supposed to believe, with characters like Jesus, Mohammed and Buddha.
Over time, these thetans began to believe Xenu s lies about false gods, and began to reincarnate on Teegeeack  but the thetans called this world  Earth  .
When intelligent life appeared on Teegeeack, thousands or millions of  Thetans  cling to every native soul  er,  thetan   and fill it s head with nonsensical thoughs and irrational beliefs.
The key idea of Scientology is to avoid tax officials and psychiatrists at all costs, while paying the church a large amount of money for special  counseling   called  auditing  in their jargon  to help you reach a special enlightened state called  Clear  where you telepathically communicate with these  thetans  clinging to you and force them out of your body, and rid yourself of evil Xenu s influence.
By the way, most Scientologists don t know this, like the Mystery Cults of the Greco-Roman world, Scientology doles it s doctrine out in tiny doses to it s new recruits, and tells the public next to nothing about what it believes.
You don t hear that whole story until you reach a special rank in their group called  OT3  for  Operating Thetan 3 .
The Church of Scientology takes advantage of the gullibility of the American people to make a tidy profit.
A new-age religion thought up by ex-sci-fi writer L.
Ron Hubbard.
They try to recruit new members by offering them  personality tests  to determine the  root cause  of the person s unhappiness.
Interestingly, the solution to this  root cause  is usually paying lots of money to the Church of Scientology.
Scientologists have been rightly satirised in several TV programmes, films and computer games, for example the movementarian cult in The Simpsons or the hubologists in Fallout 2, but despite this Scientology is still attracting a steady stream of new converts.
The main reason for this is that people are idiots.
The science of making money.
A pseudo-religion set up by a money grabbing black magician adulterer corrupt bastard called L.
Ron Hubbard.
Scientology will suck your money out of you quicker than Hoover sucks shit.
A religous cult who s beliefs revolve around an intergalactic warlord named  Xenu  who nuked a bunch of aliens here on Earth billion of years ago.
The souls of these aliens, called  Thetans , now inhabit our bodies and make us unhappy.
The only way to get rid of these  Thetans  is to pay a bunch of money to these con men for the rest of your life.
Scientology is the biggest con of all time.
Scientologists give a lot more than their money.
Scientology is a living hell once you reach the stage  Clear .
You are then informed about  Operating Thetan III  whereupon you are asked to join  The Sea Organisation  or  Sea Org .
Since they have you brainwashed by now, you eagerly except.
The Sea Org is like a concentration camp on a boat.
You are forced to undergo intense physical labor.
If you displease the slave masters, or  Captains  in anyway, you are punished in a manner called  Ethics .
You are subject to phsyical torture, sleep deprivation, things like running from 7AM to 9PM, or mopping the deck all day in the sun in a black jumpsuit.
They put you in a  recovery group  if you are being punished, and they try to brainwash you further so that you won t act out again.
In this group, there s no telling if or when you might eat, or how much food you get, and living quarters are dark, hellish, roach infested, and damp.
If you act out again, you are either put in a second level of  Recovery , where most people perish from exhaustion.
If you have done anything seirous,  Most reasons were as minor as improperly addressing a Captain , but if you have done anything that they consider serious  plans to leave, treason, mutiny , there is a book that shows level of ways to execute.
The most common way is blindfolding the prisoner, tying the hands and feet together, and dropping them off the edge of the boat into the ocean.
Scientology is like some creepy science fiction movie, but it s all really happening.
They have  Churches of $cientology  set up everywhere, they have an army, and endorsements from celebrities like Tom Cruise, Nancy Cartwright, Chick Corea, and John Travolta.
Scientology is very clever and manipulative.
A gullible person could easily fall for it by thinking they are just participants in a simple personality test.
Next thing they know, they are slaves at a concentration camp.
Brainwashed, tortured, deprived of food and sleep, and possibly being tied up and tossed into the sea.
And if they end up surviving, that s hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a good chunk out of your life, gone, never able to get back.
If you ve already started taking the courses, you are already being brainwahsed and you don t know it.
Of course they tell you to disregard this sort of talk.
By tuning it out, and not listening to the anti- Scientologists, you are proving their point.
You are being brainwashed.
The religion created by the minor Science Fiction writer, L.
Ron Hubbard in 1952.
Scientology teaches that you are an immortal  thetan  that is entrapped in the physical universe and your own problems by your thoughts  considerations and postulates .
In practice, Scientology is the exact opposite of what it teaches.
It claims to free you, but most people would say that Scientologists are brainwashed and enslaved.
It claims to promote freedom of speech, but Scientology sues anyone who says anything bad about Scientology.
It claims to want to improve the earth, but sues anyone who tries to use it s books and techniques without paying a license.

Mareka Brousseau was born a third generation Scientologist.
She discusses her childhood and the harsh conditions in Sea Org nurseries.
Mareka signed a Sea Org contract when she was nine years old.
Mareka’s mother and stepfather are Haydn and Lucy James.
Her husband John Brousseau did a couple of amazingly revealing interviews with Tony Ortega.
This is a long interview that is worth the time to listen to.
Grab a cuppa and listen to this description of a life as a Sea Org child.
Stacey Brooks  Young  interviews a young girl raised in the “Cadet Org”.
The indoctrination and mind set starts early on.
Scientology Inc based schools are hunting grounds for recruiters who get Sea Org contracts signed at a very young age.
The Delphi Academy in Oregon is a prime example.
The “Church” has vehemently denied using child labor.
Listen to what she says about the manual Labor.
The stories of Child Labor are voluminous and confirmed and re-confirmed.
From 2010 to the present, the Scientologists have targeted me specifically for harassment.
They have worked to drive a wedge between me and my husband, family, and co-workers.
Scientology investigators have visited my mother, my father, my former husband, my friends, and my co-workers.
The investigators have falsely claimed to all of these contacts that my life is at risk as long as I remain with my husband.
These malicious allegations are hateful and distressing.
Presumably because I am a woman, the Defendants seem obsessed with my sexuality.
They sent a sex toy to me at my workplace, which was very embarrassing.
With their constant surveillance of me, they knew when I was away from the office, at which time they sent flowers to one of my female co-workers with a “romantic” message purporting to be from me.
Of course this was distressing to me.
Scientology websites have published bizarre and sometimes vile allegations against me, including false claims that I am a sexual pervert.
They have even alleged that I am not even a woman, but a man who has had a secret sex-change operation.
So, I have even had my womanhood questioned as part of this sick campaign to inflict maximum emotional distress on me.
To view the full documentation and discussion, go to The Underground Bunker by Tony Ortega.

The series exposed Scientology’s unquenchable thirst for cash donations, and it also exposed Sindy Fagen to the disconnection policy.
By going public in a newspaper story critical of the church, she had crossed a line that Scientology members know is a step too far.
Scientologists close to Sindy knew they had a decision to make: disconnect from her or risk being excommunicated themselves.
One woman in particular, who we are not going to name, was especially close to Sindy and had been for many years.
She knew, however, that she actually had no choice — if she didn’t immediately disconnect from Sindy, her own status in the church was threatened.
In tears, she called Sindy and left a voice message, saying how much she regretted that she would have to disconnect.
But with Sindy going so public, she really had no alternative.
Sindy Fagen has held on to that message for two years.
She is only now allowing us to make it public because of Karin Pouw’s recent public declarations that the Church of Scientology does not force disconnection on its members.
I was standing in a doorway in Dublin on a dark and rainy evening back in March 2013.
I’m not from the city so I wasn’t sure which direction I needed to take.
A woman came along and stood next to me in the doorway.
She noticed I was upset and asked why but I couldn’t tell her because I was ashamed.
She went on to offer me her spare umbrella and when I told her I was ok and she should keep it , she told me it was fine and she had a spare one in her bag  .
She said this old umbrella had served her well and I was welcome to it.
So I took it and said I’d nothing to repay her with and she said if I said a prayer for her that would be plenty.
The umbrella is now mine.
It’s black with leopard print edges and it was a random act of kindness from a stranger that made me cry.
I don’t know who the woman was but I won’t forget her because what she didn’t know was I couldn’t say a prayer for her or feel I even had the right.
I couldn’t tell her I have a different religion because on that night back in March I was ashamed of the religion I was a part of but no longer choose to be a member of.
The church of Scientology promised her a cure for dyslexia using Tom Cruise as an example.
Instead, she had 18 years of her life and her sanity ripped away.
We ask that you please help make this post go viral so that justice can finally be done for this family.
Ex Scientologists, Anons and people who just care about justice who live in South Africa and around the world who can help with free legal advise, helping to set up legal funding in S A, and people who want to help in other ways, please contact me through the Contact the Author   and leave me your name, e-mail address and how you can help, so I can send it along to Jane.
Jane contacted me and said “I am at my wits end and don’t know what to do.
I have never exposed these crimes.
I asked Jane about her experience in Scientology.
Since 1993 I kept a low profile to prevent disconnection.
I only really found out  that my family was not alone in this boat  in July 2009, when I connected to the Internet to search for the email address of ‘The International Justice Chief’’ – but I found more than what I bargained for when I typed into Google ‘Justice   Scientology’.
I asked her to tell me about Janine.
Janine and Trinity in happier times.
If she was still ‘on lines’ when this happened – I know without a shadow of doubt she would have suffered the same fate as Lisa McPherson.
I stood by her side in hospital, day and night and at a moment’s notice as she was hospitalized for four months.
Not all wounds are visible.
Being under strict mind control for years has its price.
I hope my personal stories will serve to inform and warn you about the danger of being connected to anti social groups and people, manipulative cults, psychopaths and narcissists.
I was lucky to survive.
Others were not so fortunate.

Organizations of the Scientology Religion: The Advanced Organization and Saint Hill Europe.
The Church of Scientology was established in 1954.
Today its more than 6,000 churches, missions, related organizations, groups and activities span the globe and minister the religion to more than eight million people in 159 countries in over 66 languages.
The rapid emergence of the Scientology religion within the world’s changing spiritual community has led many to ask what kind of religion it is, how it compares with other faiths and in what ways it is different.
What is its understanding of a Supreme Being and the spiritual aspects of life which transcend the temporal world?
What social and community work is done by Scientology Church members and how do these activities relate to the greater religious purpose of the Scientology belief ?
This volume provides answers to these and other such questions about the Scientology religion and its members.
In it, leading scholars provide diverse and insightful perspectives into Scientology, resulting in a unique and comprehensive overview of the religion.
The goal of the Scientology religion is to achieve complete certainty of one s spiritual existence, one s relationship to the Supreme Being, and his role in eternity.
In this regard, countless authorities have affirmed that Scientology sits squarely within the tradition of the world s major religions.
A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology.
First announced to an enturbulated world in 1950, these aims are well within the grasp of our technology.
Nonpolitical in nature, Scientology welcomes any individual of any creed, race or nation.
Gardner 1957: 267 .
In 1950, Lafayette Ronald Hubbard  1911-1986  published Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health  The American Saint Hill Organization, Los Angeles.
The book is treated as if it were a      holy scripture by Scientologists and they treat it as if it were the      cornerstone of their church, their religion, and what they consider to be      their science.
Hubbard tells the     reader that dianetics  ...contains a therapeutic technique with which can be treated     all inorganic mental ills and all organic psycho-somatic ills, with assurance of complete     cure....  He claims that he has discovered the  single source of mental     derangement   Hubbard 6 .
However, in a disclaimer on the frontispiece of the book, we are     told that  Scientology and its sub-study, Dianetics, as practiced by the     Church...does not wish to accept individuals who desire treatment of physical illness or     insanity but refers these to qualified specialists of other organizations who deal in     these matters.  The disclaimer seems clearly to have been a protective mechanism     against lawsuits for practicing medicine without a license; the author repeatedly     insists that dianetics can cure just about anything that ails you.
He also repeatedly     insists that dianetics is a science.
Yet, just about anyone familiar with scientific texts     will be able to tell from the first few pages of Dianetics that the text is no     scientific work and the author no scientist.
Dianetics is a classic example of a pseudoscience .
On page 5 of Dianetics, Hubbard asserts that a science of mind must find  a     single source of all insanities, psychoses, neuroses, compulsions, repressions and social     derangements.  Such a science, he claims, must provide  Invariant scientific     evidence as to the basic nature and functional background of the human mind.  And,     this science, he says, must understand the  cause and cure of all psycho-somatic     ills....  Yet, he also claims that it would be unreasonable to expect a science of     mind to be able to find a single source of all insanities, since some are caused by  malformed, deleted or pathologically injured brains or nervous systems  and     some are caused by doctors.
Undaunted by this apparent contradiction, he goes on to say     that this science of mind  would have to rank, in experimental precision, with     physics and chemistry.  He then tells us that dianetics is  ...an organized     science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of natural laws on the order of     those of the physical sciences   Hubbard, 6 .
There are broad hints that this so-called science of the mind isn t a science at all in     the claim that dianetics is built on  definite axioms  and in his a priori notion that a science of mind must find a single source of mental and psychosomatic     ills.
Sciences aren t built on axioms and they don t claim a priori knowledge of     the number of causal mechanisms which must exist for any phenomena.
Of      course, science presupposes a regular order to nature and assumes there are      underlying principles according to which natural phenomena work.
It assumes      that these principles or laws are relatively constant.
But it does not      assume that it can know a priori either what these principles are or what      the actual order of any set of empirical phenomena is.
A real science is     built on tentative proposals to account for observed phenomena.
Scientific knowledge of     causes, including how many kinds there are, is a matter of discovery not stipulation.
Also, scientists generally respect logic and would have difficulty saying with a straight     face that this new science must show that there is a single source of all insanities     except for those insanities that are caused by other sources.
There is other evidence that dianetics is not a science.
For example, his theory of     mind shares little in common with modern neurophysiology and what is known about the brain     and how it works.
According to Hubbard, the mind has three parts.
The analytical     mind is that portion of the mind which perceives and retains experience data to compose     and resolve problems and direct the organism along the four dynamics.
It thinks in     differences and similarities.
The reactive mind is that portion of the mind which files     and retains physical pain and painful emotion and seeks to direct the organism solely on a     stimulus-response basis.
It thinks only in identities.
Hubbard, 39 .
According to Hubbard, the single source of insanity and psychosomatic ills is the engram.
The  reactive mind,  he says,  can give a man arthritis,     bursitis, asthma, allergies, sinusitis, coronary trouble, high blood pressure, and so on     down the whole catalogue of psycho-somatic ills, adding a few more which were never     specifically classified as psycho-somatic, such as the common cold   Hubbard,     51 .
One searches in vain for evidence of these claims.
We are simply told:  These are     scientific facts. They compare invariably with observed experience   Hubbard,     52 .
An engram is defined as  a definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the     protoplasm of a tissue. It is considered as a unit group of stimuli impinged solely on the     cellular being   Hubbard, 60 note .
We are told that engrams are only recorded during     periods of physical or emotional suffering.
During those periods the  analytical     mind  shuts off and the reactive mind is turned on.
The analytical mind has all kinds     of wonderful features, including being incapable of error.
It has, we are told, standard     memory banks, in contrast to the reactive bank.
These standard memory banks are recording     all possible perceptions and, he says, they are perfect, recording exactly what is seen or     heard, etc.
What is the evidence that engrams exist and that they are  hard-wired  into     cells during physically or emotionally painful experiences?
Unless       we postulate a human soul entering the sperm and ovum at conception, there are things       which no other postulate will embrace than that these cells are in some way       sentient  Hubbard, 71 .
This explanation is not on the  level of laboratory observation  but is a     false dilemma and begs the question .
Furthermore, the theory of souls entering zygotes has     at least one advantage over Hubbard s own theory: it is not deceptive and is clearly     metaphysical.
Hubbard tries to clothe his metaphysical claims in scientific garb.
The cells as thought units evidently have an influence, as cells, upon the body as a       thought unit and an organism.
We do not have to untangle this structural problem to       resolve our functional postulates.
The cells evidently retain engrams of painful events.
The reactive mind may very well be the combined cellular intelligence.
One need not       assume that it is, but it is a handy structural theory in the lack of any real work done       in this field of structure.
The reactive engram bank may be material stored in the cells       themselves.
The scientific fact, observed and tested, is that the organism, in the presence of       physical pain, lets the analyzer get knocked out of circuit so that there is a limited       quantity or no quantity at all of personal awareness as a unit organism  Hubbard,       71 .
Hubbard asserts that these are scientific facts based on observations and tests, but     the fact is there hasn t been any real work done in this field.
The following illustration     is typical of the kind of  evidence  provided by Hubbard for his theory of     engrams.
A woman is knocked down by a blow.
She is rendered  unconscious.  She is     kicked and told she is a faker, that she is no good, that she is always changing her mind.
A chair is overturned in the process.
A faucet is running in the kitchen.
A car is passing     in the street outside.
The engram contains a running record of all these perceptions:     sight, sound, tactile , taste, smell, organic sensation, kinetic sense, joint position,     thirst record, etc.
Hubbard, 60 .
She       has been told that she is a faker, that she is no good, and that she is always changing       her mind.
When the engram is restimulated in one of the great many ways possible , she has a       feeling that she is no good, a faker, and she will change her mind        Hubbard, 66 .
There is no possible way to empirically test such claims.
A  science  that     consists of nothing but such claims is not a science, but a pseudoscience.
Hubbard claims that enormous data has been collected and not a single exception to his     theory has been found  Hubbard, 68 .
We are to take his word on this, apparently, for all the  data  he presents are in the form of anecdotes or made-up examples like the one     presented above.
Another indication that dianetics is not a science, and that its founder hasn t a clue     as to how science functions, is given in claims such as the following:  Several     theories could be postulated as to why the human mind evolved as it did, but these are     theories, and dianetics is not concerned with structure   Hubbard, 69 .
This is his way of     saying that it doesn t concern him that engrams can t be observed, that even though they     are defined as permanent changes in cells, they can t be detected as physical structures.
It also doesn t bother him that the cure of all illnesses requires that these  permanent  engrams be  erased  from the reactive bank.
He claims that     they aren t really erased but simply transferred to the standard bank.
How this     physically or structurally occurs is apparently irrelevant.
He simply asserts that it     happens this way, without argument and without proof.
He simply repeats that this is a     scientific fact, as if saying it makes it so.
Another  scientific fact,  according to Hubbard, is that the most harmful     engrams occur in the womb.
The womb turns out to be a terrible place.
It is  wet,     uncomfortable and unprotected   Hubbard, 130 .
Mama sneezes, baby gets knocked  unconscious.  Mama runs lightly and       blithely into a table and baby gets its head stoved in.
Mama has constipation and baby, in       the anxious effort, gets squashed.
Papa becomes passionate and baby has the sensation of       being put into a running washing machine.
Mama gets hysterical, baby gets an engram.
Papa       hits Mama, baby gets an engram.
Junior bounces on Mama s lap, baby gets an engram.
And so       it goes  Hubbard, 130 .
We are told that people can have  more than two hundred  prenatal engrams and     that engrams  received as a zygote are potentially the most aberrative, being wholly     reactive. Those received as an embryo are intensely aberrative. Those received as the     foetus are enough to send people to institutions all by themselves   Hubbard,       130-131 .
What is the evidence for these claims?
How could one test a zygote to see if it records     engrams?
Hubbard, 133 .
But you must take L.
Ron Hubbard s word for it.
Scientists     generally do not expect others to take their word for such dramatic claims.
Furthermore , to get cured of an illness you need a dianetic therapist, called an     auditor.
Who is qualified to be an auditor?
Hubbard, 173 .
The auditor must     use  dianetic reverie  to effect a cure.
The goal of dianetic therapy is to     bring about a  release  or a  clear.  The former has had major stress     and anxiety removed by dianetics; the latter has neither active nor potential     psycho-somatic illness or aberration  Hubbard, 170 .
The  purpose of therapy and its sole     target is the removal of the content of the reactive engram bank. In a release, the     majority of emotional stress is deleted from this bank. In a clear, the entire content is     removed   Hubbard, 174 .
The  reverie  used to achieve these wonders is described as an     intensified use of some special faculty of the brain which everyone possesses but which  by some strange oversight, Man has never before discovered   Hubbard,       167 .
Hubbard     has discovered what none before him has seen and yet his description of this  reverie  is     of a man sitting down and telling another man his troubles  Hubbard, 168 .
In a glorious non     sequitur, he announces that auditing  falls utterly outside all existing     legislation,  unlike psychoanalysis , psychology and hypnotism which  may in some way injure individuals     or society   Hubbard, 168-169 .
It is not clear, however, why telling others one s     troubles is a monumental discovery.
Nor it is clear why auditors couldn t injure     individuals or society, especially since Hubbard advises them:  Don t evaluate     data....don t question the validity of data. Keep your reservations to yourself   Hubbard, 300 .
This does not sound like a scientist giving sound advice to his followers.
This     sounds like a guru giving advice to his disciples.
What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key      element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims.
The key      elements of Hubbard s so-called science don t seem testable, yet he      repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from      many experiments.
It isn t even clear what such  data  would look like.
Most      of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations such as the one      about a patient who believes she was raped by her father at age nine.
Hubbard, who goes on to claim      that the patient was  raped  when she was  nine days beyond conception....The pressure and upset     of coitus is very uncomfortable to the child and normally can be expected to give the     child an engram which will have as its contents the sexual act and everything that was     said   Hubbard, 144 .
Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.
Thus, we may say that Scientology is a religion built on a fiction, but what      religion isn t?
One of the more      controversial fictions of L.
Ron Hubbard involves a story about Xenu , an alien leader who      lead a contingent of space ships to Earth 75 million years ago.
The great      leader parked the ships around volcanoes and blew them up.
Something of      these annihilated aliens remains as a sort of  original sin  to be passed on      by humans, causing us continual spiritual harm.
The Church of Scientology      considers the story of Xenu a piece of  religious writing  on par with the      Old Testament.

His Blown for Good: Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology made for a gripping read, about a low-level grunt who spent                  years at Scientology s secret HQ in the California desert until                  he finally made a mad dash for freedom.
This year, we can                  report that Headley s book has been equaled.
In Counterfeit Dreams: One Man s Journey Into and Out of the World                  of Scientology , ex-Scientologist Jefferson Hawkins                  provides his own dramatic tale of getting sucked into and                  ultimately escaping from Scientology, but Hawkins was no                  low-level scrub.
He may be the reason                  Scientology became as popular as it did.
It was Hawkins s ideas                  for television ads  the  volcano  TV spot, for example  that                  propelled Dianetics to meteoric heights, leading many to                  wonder if Scientologists themselves weren t just buying up the                  books by the truckload to make sure it topped the New York                  Times Bestsellers List.

Why?
The church magazine, called inappropriately Freedom, has an issue devoted, in part, to discrediting Cooper.
To drive      traffic to its magazine for the story on  the least trusted name in news,  the church has bought ad space on Google.
Truth they refused to tell.

The church used  commercial harassment  against recruits and was fined more      than half a million euros.
Four of the leaders were given suspended      sentences of between 10 months and two years.
The original complaint in the      case dates back more than a decade, when a young woman said she took out      loans and spent the equivalent of €21,000 on      books, courses and  purification packages  after being recruited in 1998.
Russia: Scientology Ban Is Ruled Illegal The European Court of Human      Rights has ruled that Russia acted illegally when it banned the Church of      Scientology.
Marty Rathbun      and Mike Rinder, the highest officials ever to leave Scientology, were      buttressed by detailed revelations of highly placed former managers Amy      Scobee and Tom De Vocht.
The leader of the Church of      Scientology struck his subordinates numerous times and set an example for      physical violence among the tightly controlled religion s management team,      four former high-ranking executives told a newspaper for a story published      Sunday.

WHAT IS SCIENTOLOGY ?
Scientology  is a religion that offers a path to full self   realization and  spiritual awareness and ability.
The word Scientology   means “the study  of knowledge” or literally “knowing how to know”.
Scientology follows  the older Eastern traditions of religious philosophy   dating back  10,000 years to the Vedic Hymns: that one is in a state   brotherhood  with the universe and that spiritual enlightenment comes   through  increasing knowledge of one’s self.
Through this process one   comes to  fully understand themselves, others and the universe and   ultimately  your relationship to the Creator.
Scientology is a personal journey and encompasses all of  life.
In   Scientology you will find answers to the big questions in life  such as Who am I really?
Where am I going?
What happens when I die?
Am I just a body or is there more to existence than this life and the physical universe?

A clear-sighted revelation, a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Looming Tower, the now-classic study of al-Qaeda’s 9 11 attack.
Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with current and former Scientologists—both famous and less well known—and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative ability to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology.
At the book’s center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant science-fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard, whose restless, expansive mind invented a new religion.
And his successor, David Miscavige—tough and driven, with the unenviable task of preserving the church after the death of Hubbard.
We learn about Scientology’s complicated cosmology and special language.
We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and how such stars are used to advance the church’s goals.
And we meet the young idealists who have joined the Sea Org, the church’s clergy, signing up with a billion-year contract.
In Going Clear, Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of this constitutional protection.
Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observation, understanding, and shaping a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that reveals the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.
From the Hardcover edition.
Starred Review* Immersed in this book, the reader is drawn along by tantalizing revelations while simultaneously exhausted, longing for escape from its cloistered world—mirroring the accounts of many former Scientologists on the record, here.
In efficient, unemotional prose, Wright begins with the biography of founder L.
Ron Hubbard: his days as a prodigiously prolific writer of pulp fiction, his odd military career, the publication of his breakthrough self-help book Dianetics  1950 , and the influence, riches, and controversy that have followed since he founded the Church of Scientology in 1954.
For those aware of Scientology through its celebrity adherents  Tom Cruise and John Travolta are the best known  rather than its works, the sheer scope of the church’s influence and activities will prove jaw-dropping.
S.
Even more shocking may be the portrayal of the Sea Org, a cadre of true believers whose members sign contracts for a billion years of service, and toil in conditions of indentured servitude, punished mercilessly for inadvertent psychic offenses.
Their treatment is a far cry from the coddling afforded to the much-courted celebrities.
The church categorically denies all charges of Miscavige’s abuse” and “Cruise, through his attorney, denies that he ever retreated from his commitment to Scientology” .
Readers will have to decide whether to believe the Pulitzer-winning author’s carefully sourced reporting, or the church’s rebuttals.
Going Clear offers a fascinating look behind the curtain of an organization whose ambition and influence are often at odds with its secretive ways.
HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: The publisher’s announced first printing of 150,000 seems right on the money.
Wright will be promoting the book on a seven-city tour, but its reputation precedes him.
An utterly necessary story.
Brings a clear-eyed, investigative fearlessness to Scientology .
A hotly compelling read.
Courageous.
Devastating .
Essential reading.
Lawrence Wright bend over backward to be fair to Scientology.
Not to be read home alone on a stormy night: Going Clear, Lawrence Wright s scary book about Scientology and its influence.
It’s a true horror story, the most comprehensive among a number of books published on the subject in the past few years, many of them personal accounts by people who have managed to escape or were evicted from the clutches of a group they came to feel was destroying them.
A fearless, compelling, exhaustive work of muckraking journalism and a masterpiece of storytelling.
A ripping yarn about ego, money, abuse, faith, and the corrupting nature of power when wielded by the wrong people.

Jaw-dropping.
Imagine if you were reading a novel that included a character who wrote sci-fi novels, was obsessed with wealth and status symbols, was paranoid about the government, treated others badly, and yet started a religion as a business venture that attracted thousands of devoted followers.
You d probably say,  yeah, right; a nice allegory for an aspect of the American psyche, but I don t think so.  Although, if you were familiar with Scientology, you might not be so surprised.
Many aren t familiar with Scientology, in part because the Scientologists have been relentless and devoted to stamping out dissent and negative portrayals of their religion  previous books on L.
Ron Hubbard, Scientology s founder ended up with the publisher abandoning the project due to law suits and the British publisher of this book, dropped it for fear of libel law suits  .
New Yorker writer Lawrence Wright, who is known as one of our great investigative journalists, has prepared himself by doing an incredible amount of due diligence and fact checking  apparently the fact checkers at the New Yorker, which first published an article on Scientology by Wright, made herculean efforts to make sure they got the facts right .
Scientology does not come off well in Going Clear.
Wright portrays Scientology as in large part an expression of L.
Even as Hubbard was inventing the doctrine, each of his decisions and actions would become enshrined in Scientology lore as something to be emulated -- his cigarette smoking, for instance, which is still a feature of the church s culture at the upper levels, as are his 1950s habits of speech, his casual misogyny, his aversion to perfume and scented deodorants, and his love of cars and motorcycles and Rolex watches.
More significant is the legacy of his belittling behavior toward subordinates and his paranoia about the government.
Wright, however, does not create a simple portrayal of Hubbard and Scientology.
He grants him greater complexity than a simple con man.
It seems Hubbard, who had a fertile imagination and intelligence  amazingly, he wrote 1,000 books--no small feat even if you were just the typist , believed in his own ideas.
Obviously, there was something powerfully charismatic about him, but as someone who tends to gloss over at Hubbard s cosmology and  discoveries,  it s hard to understand  and watching an interview of him online didn t shed any light for me on his appeal .
It seemed that Hubbard was a congenital fibber--one of those people for whom reality just wasn t good enough so he had to embellish it and ultimately couldn t himself separate out his fantasies from reality.
What s whacky and fascinating is that he got others to deeply believe in his ideas too.
Why though?
It was that part of this overall incredibly researched book that I found a bit lacking.
The big picture how he did it is that Hubbard parlayed the success of Dianetics, his self-help bestseller, into a religion.
In a way Scientology is a truly modern religion in that it mixes a faux-scientific veneer  it s founder after all was a sci-fi writer  with a belief system and psycho-spiritual approaches.
What I wanted was a better understanding of how that self-help book>religion initial transition actually worked.
Not what are Hubbard s beliefs, but how he created believers.
Hubbard seemed oblivious, even allergic, to practical details.
It seems his third ish wife  his marriage to his second wife wasn t legally sanctioned  Mary Sue, was the real organizer, but I still was left scratching my head about that leap from self-help and sci-fi writer to guru.
It was clear what was in it for Hubbard; he became fabulously wealthy and revered.
But what was in it for the followers, especially the initial ones who didn t have legions of fellow believers to bolster Hubbard s saintly status?
Going Clear, however, is not just about L.
Ron Hubbard.
Wright covers the violent and tight-shipped rule of David Miscaviage.
Miscaviage comes off as a classic tyrant  the purges and public community confessions reminded me of Mao s China  who needs to be deposed, yet he seems to have built an impregnable fort around him.
As an outsider, one is mystified as to why Scientologists would accept such abuse.
But by the time Miscaviage s associates get to his inner circle they have invested years in the religion and all their friends and often family are believers.
Being cast aside comes with a very heavy cost.
Overall, this is a very worthwhile book.
It reads well and raises interesting questions about what is a scam and what is a religion  for example, we mostly accept belief in a virgin births or parting seas as part of legitimate religions, but balk at Hubbard s visions of outer space theology .
There are no easy answers, but one is left by a very uneasy feeling about Hubbard s legacy.
I ve read another summary of Scientology - Wright s is far superior, and I especially like his detailing of the church s beliefs.
He traces Scientology from its origin in the imagination of science-fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard, its struggle to become accepted as a legitimate  and tax-exempt  religion, efforts to infiltrate governments  placed up to 5,000 Scientologists as spies in government agencies around the world, charging them with finding officials files on the church to help generate intimidating lawsuits,  vindictive treatment of critics  favorite weapon - lawsuits intended to bury the defendant in legal costs  and many who leave its ranks  often incarcerated in deplorable conditions for years and further punished if they tried to escape , and its impressive wealth.
The objective, per Wright, of Scientologists, is to climb up the Bridge to Total Freedom s innumerable steps and then achieve eternal life.
The organization s major goal is recruiting new members, increasingly achieved via exploiting celebrities such as Tom Cruise, John Travolta - he credits Scientology with putting his career into high-gear , and enlisting young members into its Sea Organization clergy - often as young 10 - 12 year-old children signing up for billion-year contracts and work under poor conditions for little no payment  eg.
90-hour weeks for $50 week, with one day off for schooling  and pressured to undergo abortions if they became pregnant.
4 million new people every year.
More credible is the estimate of a former high-level publicity person for the group - he estimated it only has 30,000 members, while the Statistical Abstract of the United States puts the number at 25,000.
The church is believed to hold about $1 billion in liquid assets and 12 million square-feet of property, including 26 properties in Hollywood valued at $400 million and 68 more in Clearwater, Florida, valued at another $168 million.
Besides donations from members, Scientology also obtains the revenues from 1,000+ books written by Hubbard.
David Touretzky, computer-science professor at Carnegie Mellon estimates that all the coursework costs nearly $300,000, and the additional auditing  including  repair auditing   and contributions expected of upper-level members may run the total to over half a million dollars.
There are three levels of Scientologists.
Public Scientologists  constitute the vast majority, many of these first solicited onto it in shopping malls or transit venues.
They re first led to a Scientology location where they re given  stress tests  with a quasi lie-detector  E-meter - again, adding to the  science  label  or personality inventories that entice them into paying for courses or auditing therapies that address problems most on their minds.
The second level is constantly pursued to boost its recruitment appeal and advance its causes such as attacks on psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry for their having spoken out against Scientology, and promotion of its theories of education and drug rehabilitation.
Anne Archer, Ted Danson, Michelle Pfeiffer, George Clooney, and Greta Van Susteren have been involved.
A.
Clearwater.
Scientologists believe Hubbard discovered the existential truths of their doctrine through extensive research  hence,  science   into the writings of Freud and others; he was not visited by an angel  eg.
Mormonism  or divine  eg.
Jesus , though he also states that his first insights came in a dentist s office while under sedation.
Hubbard then  realized  that 75 million years ago an evil overlord named Xenu sent human thetans to Earth in space vehicles resembling DC-8s.
S.
Navy records - supposedly because Hubbard was in secret intelligence work.
He defined Scientology s goals as creating a civilization without insanity, criminals, or war, where Man is free to rise to greater heights - this idealism appeals to the young.
Another fertile recruiting ground - drug users who have become open to the idea of alternative realities.
Often the process has led participants to recall past lives.
Hubbard contended we are thetens, immortal spiritual beings incarnated in numerous lifetimes.
The ultimate goals of evaluating is to not just liberate one from destructive mental phenomena, but also from the laws of matter, energy, space, and time.
Once free of these limitations, the theten can roam the universe or even create new ones.
Supposedly one who is Clear has flawless memory and the ability to perform mental tasks at great speed, as well as being less susceptible to disease.
No credible examples, however, have been found, per Wright s research.
Hubbard also reportedly cured 49er quarterback John Brodie s arm injury.
Film director Paul Haggis  Oscar-winning, with an extensive Hollywood background  is a major figure in  Going Clear,  with Wright documenting his story of indoctrination into the church and leaving 34 years later because he was ashamed of its support for California s gay-marriage ban ballot proposition and its is smearing of ex-members, and calling it a cult.
One has to wonder why those imprisoned by Scientology didn t walk out and call police.
One explanation is the  Stockholm syndrome,  lack of external friends is another, and a third is that they were told they would have to pay back eg.
100,000 for Scientology classes they had taken.
Wright also reports that Hubbard beat his second wife  married in a bigamous relationship, unknown to her , then tortured her with sleep deprivation, strangulations, and  scientific torture experiments,  kidnapped their daughter, reported her to the FBI as a Communist, and suggested that she kill herself so he didn t have to incur the stigma of a divorce.
She  Sara  declined, and after the divorce ran from him with her child as fast as she could.
The  bad news  is that Hubbard has been replaced by a reportedly authoritarian and violent David Miscavige.
Scientologists now are encouraged to sever relations with non-believing relatives, and some marrieds are forced to divorce.
Could such an obnoxious person who made things up science-fiction style as he went along also serve as a credible founder of a  real  religion, and would a  real  religion treat members such as Scientology has?
Read Wright s excellent  Going Clear  and decide for yourself.
Tom Cruise doesn t come out unscathed either.
Wow, this book is amazing.
Both this and Reitman s Inside Scientology: The Story of America s Most Secretive Religion are required reads for those interested in Scientology.
The Scientology website does not tell you the whole story.
That is a proven, documented, fact.
I also say this as a former Scientologist that left a few months ago.
This book not only follows the story of a prominent Scientologist that left after a long 34 years as a dedicated Scientologist, but also provides great insight into the founder of the organization, as well as the host of controversy that has followed Scientology since its founding.
If you re considering joining Scientology, I encourage you to not only read what they say about themselves on their website, but also read the neutral and critical perspectives of Scientology as well, including this book.
This organization is not a joke.
I quietly left in November, and to this day, I still receive daily phone calls, texts, emails, letters, etc.
They wanted me to forget about my education and work for Scientology, since they view their religion as the most important thing in the whole world, of all time.
I was told by one staff member that studying for a graduate entrance exam was not as important as studying Scientology.
I was also pressured to buy books and lectures, even when I said that I didn t have enough money.
I was pressured to join staff at  the org , even after repeatedly stating that I had no time with school and work, and even after explicitly stating that I didn t want to.
If you value your time, your education, and most importantly your money, do not join Scientology.
This book will only corroborate what other former members have been saying for a long time.
Xenu story, which can be found in Hubbard s own hand writing.
This material is discussed within the book.
Scientology provides no peer-reviewed, scientific studies to support its claims  especially for its purported efficacy over the medical specialty of psychiatry , besides  LRH said so .
You ll find out about how Hubbard was not who he said he was, according to official documents freely available.
Wright s statement that  Hubbard entered the School of Engineering at George Washington University in the fall of 1930.  He was a poor student-failing German and calculus-but he excelled in extracurricular activities  is classic.
Wright s overview of what a Suppressive Person is is important, especially as we see how Scientology is dealing with the release of this book.
He also covers Scientology s evolution from a  science of mental health  to a purported religion.
Of course no book on Scientology would be complete without discussing the two  first Clears , and how they didn t have the abilities Hubbard claimed Clears would have.
I also loved the discussion of life in the early Sea Org  Scientology s elite order of the most dedicated members, who sign billion-year contracts , as this is something that many of us are not familiar with.
Hubbard said  what is true for you is what you have observed yourself .
I and many others that have been there have observed Scientology to not be what it claims, and that it will ruin your life, as they try to mold you into what they want, to serve their purposes.
This well-researched book supports that observed truth.
I bought the Kindle edition but now will also buy the hardcover copy as well.
It s that good.

Scientology has been recognised officially as a “religion” after Britain’s    highest court swept aside 158 years of law to rule that worshipping a god is    not essential to religion.
In a landmark judgment, five Supreme Court Justices redefined religion in law    in order to enable the group to conduct weddings.
It follows a five-year legal battle by Louisa Hodkin, a 25-year-old    scientologist, who was seeking the right to get married at the Church of    Scientology chapel in central London, which she attends.
Miss Hodkin and her fiancé Alessandro Calcioli, who were at court to hear the    judgment handed down, hailed the decision as a victory for freedom of    worship.
But ministers voiced alarm that it could open the way for the group to claim    lucrative tax breaks worth hundreds of thousands of pounds a year and other    legal privileges.
The Government is now taking legal advice amid fears that the judgment could    open the way for organisations branded as “cults” to receive tax breaks.
It is understood they are examining the possibility of a change to the law.
Tory ministers immediately rounded on Labour, branding the Equality Act – steered through Parliament by Harriet Harman when in power – as “flawed”,    arguing the decision will leave “hard-pressed taxpayers” funding exemptions    from local rates for scientologist churches.
Miss Hodkin launched a legal challenge after the Registrar General of births,    deaths and marriages refused to register the chapel to conduct marriages    because it was not recognised as a place of  religious worship .
That decision stemmed from a 1970 court case which excluded scientology    because it did not fit within the terms of the 1855 Places of Worship    Registration Act which counts only groups which revere a “deity” as true    religions.
But even in the 1970 case Lord Denning observed that Buddhist temples are    already treated as an “exception”.
Miss Hodkin’s legal challenge was initially turned down by Mr Justice Ouseley    at the High Court last year on the basis of the legal definition but he    immediately passed the case to the Supreme Court to reassess the law.
The five justices, including Lord Neuberger, the President f the Supreme    Court, ruled that it amounted to discrimination to exclude groups which do    not formally worship a god or gods.
The court heard that although scientologists use the word “God” in services,    the term is understood to mean “inifinity” and not a specific being.
Unless there is some compelling contextual reason for holding otherwise,    religion should not be confined to religions which recognise a supreme    deity,” said Lord Toulson, delivering the lead judgment.
In the judgment he charted the development of religious toleration in England    since the Reformation and even delved into disputes within Christian    theology over the nature of God.
He concluded that religion could be defined more accurately as a “spiritual or    non-secular belief system” which “claims to explain mankind’s place in the    universe and relationship with the infinite” and give people guidance on    life.
Such a belief system may or may not involve belief in a supreme being, but it    does involve a belief that there is more to be understood about mankind’s    nature and relationship to the universe than can be gained from the senses    or from science,” he said.
But ministers voiced alarm at the decision.
During debates in 2006 Michael    Gove, now the education secretary, used Parliamentary privilege to describe    scientology as an “evil cult”.
Brandon Lewis, the local government minister, said: “I am very concerned about    this ruling, and its implications for business rates.
In the face of concerns raised by Conservatives in Opposition, Labour Ministers told Parliament during the passage of the Equalities Bill that    Scientology would continue to fall outside the religious exemption for    business rates.
Today, Paul Thomas Anderson s movie The Master opens in a few theaters here, and the media reaction has been electric.
We ve all watched as interest in Scientology has skyrocketed this summer, and it seems to have reached some kind of culmination this week with Anderson s movie in theaters and Maureen Orth s story on the cover of Vanity Fair.
I ve decided to take advantage of this moment to change directions.
Next week will be my last as editor of the Voice; I will be leaving to pursue a book proposal about Scientology in its time of crisis.
Today at 6 pm, Scientology will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a building in Washington DC s Dupont Circle neighborhood.
For the last couple of years, Scientology has opened  Ideal Orgs  -- fancy, superfluous new churches in cities around the world in an expensive ploy to make it look like the church is expanding.
But today s dedication is especially curious.
At a time when Scientology is reeling from several major crises and more negative press attention than ever in its history, the church is officially opening a  National Affairs Office  in the nation s capital, expecting that it can become a player in American politics.
Well, you can t blame them for trying.
But their timing?
We re wondering if they ve been hanging out in the sauna too long.
I talked earlier today to Ed Winter, assistant chief coroner of Los Angeles County, who tells me that he s ruling Alexander Jentzsch s death an accident.
The 27-year-old son of Scientology president Heber Jentzsch was found dead on the morning of July 3 at the home of his in-laws.
Winter has now determined that Alexander was suffering from pneumonia while he was on a prescription of methadone.
His injury was  drug intake,  Winter says, and  final mode  of death an accident.
I said to Winter.
Karen de la Carriere, Alexander s mother, tells me that Winter is not done investigating.
They don t even have all the reports back yet.
She points out that a healthy 27-year-old is not likely to die from pneumonia.
And if he was following his methadone prescription -- and so far there s no indication that he didn t -- that also should not have been lethal.
It s the combination that killed Alexander Jentzsch.
The son of the president of the Church of Scientology International, cut off by the church from both of his parents, was taking methadone while he had serious pneumonia rather than antibiotics.
And that doesn t look good.
We ve always been suckers for the final scene of It s a Wonderful Life.
No matter how many times we see it, we tear up at the sight of George Bailey s friends coming to his aid in his time of need, proving to him that he really is the richest man in town.
Over the last couple of days, we watched something remarkable happen as the readers of this blog rallied to help a family in a somewhat similar circumstance.
Only this time it wasn t old man Potter providing the bullying tactics, but the attorneys of the Church of Scientology.
S.
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after a lower court had dismissed their 2009 lawsuits against the church.
In a lengthy and detailed decision , federal appellate judge Diarmuid O Scannlain found that as longtime members of Scientology s hardcore  Sea Org,  the Headleys had certainly endured hardships -- Claire claimed that she had been forced to have two abortions in order to keep up with the Sea Org s 100-hour weeks while paid pennies an hour -- but Scientology had not violated human trafficking laws.
06.
As a matter of procedure, they say, their attorney asked the church to waive those costs.
They were stunned when they got the church s response, explaining what it wanted in order to make that debt go away.
We managed to find a copy of the new Vanity Fair today, and we ve read Maureen Orth s story,  What Katie Didn t Know,  about Tom Cruise and his Scientology-approved search for a new wife.
As advertised, there s really good stuff here.
But there s also a lot we knew before and that s been reported here at the Voice.
So join us as we show you our notes after giving Orth s story a good read.
The Voice received an e-mail this morning from Oscar-winning director Paul Haggis after we asked him about the Church of Scientology s attack on him and Nazanin Boniadi which appeared on Us Weekly s website yesterday.
Over the weekend, Haggis spoke up to defend Boniadi -- who acted in his movie The Next Three Days -- when she turned out to be the subject of this month s Vanity Fair in a story about her being one of several women who were  auditioned  in 2004 by Scientology to become the next girlfriend for Tom Cruise.
According to a teaser of that story published on Vanity Fair s website Saturday, Boniadi dated Cruise for about three months before she somehow displeased both Cruise and the church s leader, David Miscavige.
As a result, she was punished with cleaning toilets with a toothbrush and other indignities.
Scientology struck back yesterday, with an official statement that was delivered by an unnamed spokesperson -- whose identity was hidden by Us Weekly, a decision we questioned earlier -- accusing Haggis of being in a relationship at some point with Boniadi.
In 1955, Scientology founder L.
Ron Hubbard announced  Project Celebrity,  coming up with a list of Hollywood stars he wanted his followers to treat as  game  to hunt down for the church.
You know the list.
Cruise.
Travolta.
Alley.
Elfman.
Archer.
Corea.
Hayes.
Rimini.
Beck.
Etc.
These celebrities not only gave the relatively small organization some luster, they were trained how to talk about Scientology -- in positive, but always very vague, terms -- and entertainment reporters knew not to pry.
But now, with Scientology going through several serious crises -- from flagging membership to investigations of deaths at its drug rehab centers -- the church s biggest problems are only being magnified because of the involvement of its celebrities.
Could its obsession with Hollywood stars ultimately hasten Scientology s demise?
Let s go over the evidence.
UPDATE after the jump: Breaking news about Paul Haggis and the Vanity Fair bombshell about Tom Cruise.
One of Scientology s enduring mysteries is that it has attracted Hollywood stars when it has such a reputation for homophobia.
The sexual orientation of its top celebrities is always a matter of popular speculation, and even those with the barest understanding of Scientology seem to know that if celebrity members are gay, they have to keep quiet about it.
Scientology is going through several serious crises right now, but its treatment of homosexuals is never far behind its other more immediate troubles.
It was the San Diego church s support of California s homophobic Proposition 8 in 2008, for example, that became the last straw for director Paul Haggis, who famously quit the church and then told his story to the New Yorker last year.
Now, we have a remarkable story about a man named Keith Relkin who for several years became a sort of unofficial spokesman for queer Scientology.
He was the church s token gay guy in West Hollywood, insisting to the public that Scientology was actually friendly to homosexuality.
On February 3, Relkin died.
And now, his friends have shared with the Voice some of his e-mails and other writings which show that behind the scenes, Relkin was actually very frustrated with the deep-seated homophobia of his church.
Scientology watchers, we have a treat for you this morning.
This video has been making the rounds the last couple of days, and we can see why it s generating so much interest.
Mike Napier, the captain of Scientology s private cruise ship, the Freewinds, stars in this film and tells us about the benefits of his  competence and leadership  course  which looks hard to distinguish from your typical Outward Bound sort of experience, but what do we know .
This is Scientology, so naturally the claims are off the charts -- for example, swabbing the decks of the church s tugboat is somehow going to teach you how not to age!

Ron Hubbard  second from right  with his family: Suzette  left , wife Mary Sue, Quentin, Arthur and Diana outside his mansion, Saint Hill Manor, in Sussex, England in 1959.
Scientology founder L.
Two red-haired, almond-eyed boys — each possessing an other-worldly ability to mesmerize an audience and capture its allegiance — are born 66 years apart.
The first, born in 1911, leads disciples in the tens of thousands by founding a religion called Scientology.
The second, born in 1977, enthralls disciples of his own in the Bay Area as a slam poet, filmmaker, writer and modern-day vaudevillian.
Of looks and brains and verbal dexterity, Jamie DeWolf and his famous great-grandfather, L.
Ron Hubbard, could be twins.
But of money and religion they share little.
DeWolf, 36, is one of Scientology’s harshest critics, a hero to the disbelievers who call the religion a cult.
His one-man performance about Hubbard has more than a million views on YouTube.
He started as a storyteller, just another name on dime-store pulp mags paid only a penny a page until 1949 when he said,  You wanna know how you really get rich?
You start a religion,’” DeWolf intones, his cinnamon hair glowing in the spotlight on a blackened stage in Oakland.
Hubbard “wrote  Dianetics,’ transforming science fiction into fact.
Overnight, he went from pennies to a prophet, from myths to millions, until the world demanded to see his evidence.
But L.
Yet Hubbard’s hustle and his audaciousness in inventing a doctrine that is still compelling to Hollywood giants like Tom Cruise, John Travolta and others decades after his death in 1986, also strikes the great-grandson another way.
I can’t help but be impressed,” he admits.
L.
Ron exploited human weakness, and used a kind of showman’s manipulative powers.
DeWolf speaks in a voice you don’t argue with, like a professor’s, a president’s or a preacher’s.
He is one of the best slam poets ever to take the stage.
A National Poetry Slam Champion, he performs for National Public Radio’s storytelling show, “Snap Judgment,” where audience members wipe their eyes and drop their jaws at his work.
He is one of the Suicide Kings, a slam poetry trio that has toured the country.
60 Minutes” once filmed a poetry contest he was in.
The audience-participation show he created features comedians, rap artists and slam poets, and plays out in a boxing ring in the cavernous Oakland Metro Operahouse the first Thursday of every month.
This is not for you if you find seriously offensive, dirty and limit-pushing humor appalling,” one San Francisco reviewer wrote on Yelp.
On a recent night, the line for “Tourettes” stretched two blocks.
Inside, dozens of stagehands and show people dressed in torn fishnets, towering heels and plunging décolletage prepared their acts, which included finding a place for a 10-foot-high unicycle, three apple pies and assorted pig masks.
Johnny Cash belted out “Ring of Fire” on the sound system as the patrons swarmed in.
DeWolf, in red suspenders and jaunty hat, leaped into the boxing ring and ordered the salivating crowd to its feet.
Rule No.
F— your phone!
He held up a sign to that effect and threw out handfuls of condoms to emphasize the point.
By the time the evening ended three hours later and after midnight, the audience was covered in glitter and sweat, quite possibly deaf, and exhausted from laughing.
The ringmaster lives in a ramshackle flat in Alameda he shares with his film editor.
Books are everywhere — true-crime novels, show biz studies, Scientology tomes stacked up not as bedside reading but as a nightstand.
Posters, clown masks and scarlet walls suggest dorm-room chic.
But the open laptop and whiteboard he uses to track the productions, promotions and film fests he’s involved with reveal it as a businessman’s lair.
Besides running “Tourettes,” DeWolf has a new feature-length film, “Smoked,” that just went into national distribution.
It’s a wacky spoof he wrote, co-directed and co-starred in about three guys who rob an Oakland cannabis club.
He directs and shoots public-service films about youth homelessness and diabetes.
He mentors kids and teaches filmmaking in Hayward.
He leads writing workshops at schools, detention centers and colleges.
He’s so busy that it took him until age 30 to graduate from college, with a degree in film from San Francisco State.
DeWolf also hosts erotic and horror film fests and emcees festivals, including Art & Soul in Oakland; burlesque shows like “Beautiful Anarchy” in Oakland; and the Vau De Vire Society’s avant-garde circus shows.
He writes long-form poems, plays and short films.
He’s won major poetry slam competitions and has performed at San Quentin Prison.
He’s also appeared at “Anti-Scientology Summits” in Clearwater, Fla.
Scientology’s home city.
I wanted to meet him,” DeWolf said of Hubbard.
Hubbard dropped from sight in 1980, plagued with legal troubles and health problems.
I was told not to ask my grandfather, L.
DeWolf said.
L.
Ron and L.
Ron, Jr.
DeWolf’s grandfather, L.
1934 into a front-row seat for the creation of Scientology.
He helped with that family business for a while, but later told Penthouse magazine that “99% of anything my father ever wrote or said about himself is untrue,” and compared Scientology’s inner sanctum, the “Sea Org,” with the Hitler Youth.
So fully did Hubbard Jr.
Scientology that he changed his name to Ronald DeWolf, a name from another side of the family.
Ronald DeWolf’s daughter, Deborah, is Jamie DeWolf’s mother.
DeWolf entered the world in Eureka, a quiet, rural region far removed from the disco-crazed nation of the late 1970s.
At the time, his grandfather was wrestling with Scientology for control of Hubbard’s estate and eventually accepted an undisclosed court settlement.
The family says it went mostly toward medical bills.
Jamie DeWolf’s parents split when he was 3 and his brother, Asher, was 1.
His mom, who worked in administrative jobs, married a civil engineer named Robert Kennedy, who adopted the boys when they were 11 and 12.
Soon the family moved to Benicia.
Christianity, not Scientology, was the family religion.
I was incredibly religious.
Super devout,” said DeWolf, who absorbed the kind of religious tracts that described the red birthmark on Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s forehead as the sign of the beast.
A loner as a child, DeWolf found he was interested in subjects far beyond Christianity: Native Americans, Jews, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Hernán Cortez.
He read about them all.
He credits those books with changing his views on Christianity, which he no longer accepts.
I had to personally deprogram myself,” he said.
Yet he entered adolescence feeling alone and troubled, as if a “toxic Molotov cocktail” simmered inside him.
He points to an early trauma.
I was molested when I was a child,” he said.
The effect was that as a teen, he turned to cutting himself, mutilating his arms with a butcher knife.
An invisible man bleeding in front of everybody,” is how he put it.
Today, scars on his left forearm are obscured by the Zodiac killer’s circle-and-cross, a tattoo he acquired in his early 20s.
There was a point when I felt I was at a very dangerous crossroads,” said DeWolf, sitting at a paper-cluttered table in his living room.
His unease arose not only out of childhood trauma and divorce, but from the legacy of an ancestor with formidable genes and a habit of inflicting anguish on generations of family members.
It all dripped down like acid rain into the psyche of an uncertain young man.
The Scientology logo is tattooed on his right arm: an “S” and a double triangle.
Because it’s woven into me,” the great-grandson says.
The mentality of a cult leader is the same as a serial killer.
The Zodiac wanted to smash his name into the world as hard as he could — the same as L.
Ron wanted to smash his name in.
His art would save him.
DeWolf turned to writing and poetry the way others turn to drink.
His essay about the man who molested him, “Stigmata,” begins: “God saved the man who raped me.
The man who did it, the husband of a babysitter, was never arrested.
Was I your first?
Are you still alive?
The cerebral showman began unleashing more poetry — and more demons — at the microphones that were just opening up in the bedroom communities of Benicia and Vallejo in the late 1990s.
I would come in with this fire and blood,” DeWolf said.
They barred him in suburbia.
But they welcomed him in Oakland.
DeWolf was 21 when he created “Tourettes Without Regrets” in 1999.
Today, despite the raunch, he invites his parents to the shows.
I know I’m in for a rocky ride,” laughed Deborah Kennedy, still a devout Christian.
She said it isn’t hard for her to separate the performance from the performer.
He’s always been extremely bright, creative — extremely sensitive — and very loving,” she said.
He’s just a great person.
Xiana, 7, lived in a down-and-out Vallejo apartment with her mother and her mother’s boyfriend in 1999 when she vanished one rainy morning while walking to the school bus stop.
A portrait of Xiana soon emerged as a neglected child born in prison to a mother serving time for auto theft.
Neighbors said she frequently missed her bus and returned to find no one home.
She’d wait in the hallway for hours, often in tears.
At 21, DeWolf lived in the building with his girlfriend and newborn daughter.
He saw Xiana every day.
We took her in for peanut butter and jelly.
A year after Xiana disappeared, someone found her skull in the hills above Los Gatos.
Curtis Dean Anderson, a child molester serving 251 years for another abduction, was convicted in 2005.
But it was DeWolf who felt the guilt.
I didn’t know your story when you were alive,” he tells the slain child in his performance.
But I can tell it now and ask the world to remember your name: Xiana Fairchild.
His own daughter lives in Texas with her mother, but she and DeWolf are close.
Nadia, 15, surprised her father last year by memorizing a funny piece he wrote about split parents forced to hang out with each other at their children’s school and reciting it at Tourettes.
Now father and daughter do it as a duet.
Unlike his great-grandfather, DeWolf has earned the admiration of his family.
He’s the brother that I look up to,” said Eli Grant, 28, of Arcata  Humboldt County , a half-brother who, with brother Asher Kennedy, often help out at Tourettes.
He’s just a really hard worker and always helping other people out with their films and shows,” Grant said.
I meet people all the time and hear them talking about him.

Mr.
Miscavige is unrelenting in his work for millions of parishioners and the cities served by Scientology Churches.
He has led a renaissance for the religion itself, while driving worldwide programs to serve communities through Church-sponsored social and humanitarian initiatives.
David Miscavige spearheaded a program to build every Church of Scientology into what Scientology Founder L.
Ron Hubbard termed  Ideal Organizations   Ideal Orgs .
This new breed of Church is ideal in location, design, quality of religious services and social betterment programs.
Each is uniquely configured to accommodate the full array of Scientology services for both parishioners and the surrounding community.
Ideal Orgs further house extensive public information multimedia displays that introduce every facet of Dianetics and Scientology, along with libraries, course and seminar rooms for an introduction to and study of Scientology Scripture.
Chapels serve to host Sunday Services and other congregational gatherings.
It is from these Ideal Churches that Scientologists extend their humanitarian programs to mitigate intolerance, illiteracy, immorality and drug abuse.
The post then lists the  unprecedented 12 Ideal Scientology Churches  built around the world last year, including locations in Germany, California, Italy and Israel, with accompanying pictures of each opening s celebration.
And let s not forget the comments.
Of the 17 comments posted as of this writing, 11 are so pro-Scientology they read as though they re an extension of the original post.
A bold, proud day for The Atlantic and its fine history of journalistic excellence.

Tom Cruise Scientology-Video Glossary: What Is He Talking About?
The actor talks for nine minutes in his instantly famous Scientology video.
Can you figure out what he s actually saying?
Here s a guide.
Tom Cruise talks for nine minutes in his instantly famous Scientology video — now, can anyone figure out what he’s actually saying?
It’s a far nicer thing to call us — kind of like “Muggles in “Harry Potter” — than the term they usually use, “wog,” which is more equivalent to the derogatory “Mudbloods” in the “Potter” books.
LRH: L.
I take this as a half-ack”: What was that sound?
A furball?
Actually, a “half-ack” — a half-acknowledgement — means you were encouraged.
Get that?
KSW: Keeping Scientology Working.
Refers to a policy LRH published in 1965 that requires all Scientologists to follow his words and rules exactly.
It is something that you have to earn”: Cruise is referring to taking Scientology courses.
According to the church, to get to the higher levels of Scientology — he’s an OT VII, the highest level is OT VIII — you must complete a number of courses and auditing sessions, a sort of Scientological take on the Catholic confession.
And it all costs; depending on your level, the tab for wisdom can be hundreds if not thousands of dollars.
To finally learn what the basis of Scientology’s precepts are  about how we got remnants of space aliens known as thetans trapped in our system , you must attain the level of OT III.
The secrets of Xenu aren’t free!
Cruise’s relentless stare is actually a technique from “Success Through Communication” training routine  TR  drills.
According to former and current members, pre-clears have to learn to look someone straight in the eye for hours.
It’s supposed to generate self-confidence and intimidate the other party.
No blinking!
To put your ethics “in” someone else, as Cruise later says, is to make someone else conform.
The ability to create new and better realities and improve conditions”: “Conditions” refer to LRH principles, which are charted on a scale.
It’s a Scientologist’s goal to “improve conditions,” which means improving your relationship with yourself and to those within your group.
The “conditions”  in order  are: confusion, treason, enemy, doubt, liability, nonexistence, danger, emergency, normal, affluence, power change and power, according to numerous accounts of church practices.
The methods and principles learned in Scientology courses.
Orgs are there to help”: Not Orcs from “Lord of the Rings” — orgs, as in Scientology churches and other organizations, such as Narconon, Criminon and Second Chance, all of which can be found online.
Criminon: Scientology group that recruits through prisons, promising alcohol and drug rehabilitation.
An SP is someone who commits suppressive acts, like murder, criticizing Scientology or altering LRH’s teachings, according to former and current members.
Journalists are automatically considered SPs because they traffic in bad news and so are barred from entering Scientology.
Psychiatrists would also be SPs, so Cruise says, “Crush these guys!
I’ve had it!
No mercy!
None!
The church says it no longer officially practices this, however, it is still a fairly contentious organization.
PTS: “Potential Trouble Sources,” as in Scientologists who are losing the faith or are being influenced by an SP.
PTS SP: A course in how to “handle” and or “disconnect” PTS and SPs, which usually costs about $1,600, according to estimates from church members.
Ways to Happiness”: Actually, “A Way to Happiness,” a booklet of the Scientology version of the 10 Commandments, except theirs has 21 Commandments.

In the fall of 2004, an accomplished, gorgeous Scientologist named Nazanin Boniadi was allegedly selected by officials in the organization to be Tom Cruise’s next girlfriend.
Her never-before-told story—of the months inseparable from the star  and his watchers , before she fell out of favor—reveals a complex dynamic that also affected Cruise s relationships with Nicole Kidman, Penélope Cruz, and, now, Katie Holmes.
Maureen Orth investigates.

EXIT Katie Holmes files for divorce from Tom Cruise and heads to New York with Suri.
Tom Cruise was in a state because he didn’t have a girl.
David Miscavige, the chief of the Church of Scientology International, as Miscavige joined him and Cruise’s sister Lee Anne DeVette at the opening of the Madrid Scientology center, in September 2004.
Miscavige, according to Rinder and Marty Rathbun, Scientology’s former inspector general and No.
2, prided himself on being able to produce with a snap of his fingers anything Cruise desired, as well as to remove whatever he considered to be obstacles in the star’s life, such as his last wife, Nicole Kidman, and his last girlfriend, Penélope Cruz.
Rinder and Rathbun are part of a group of former high-ranking dissidents no longer connected to the organization.
They and the other sources in this article, virtually all of them on the record, have been dismissed by Scientology as disgruntled apostates and worse.
A lawyer for Miscavige refers to Rathbun and Rinder as “a dynamic duo of lunatic venom and untrustworthy bile” and denies that the incident above ever took place.
According to several of these on-the-record sources, Scientology more and more came to be whatever Miscavige said it was, and both Kidman and Cruz had been found wanting in their embrace of the organization and therefore unsuitable for the highly prized Cruise—Kidman especially.
Cruise and the two children the couple had adopted during their 10-year marriage.
Cruise sued for divorce, and the children—Bella, then eight, and Connor, then six—were reportedly given a course in identifying Suppressive Persons.
As Penélope Cruz became Cruise’s new love interest, she took her own set of courses, but, the sources say, she soon ran afoul of Miscavige, who dismissed her as a mere “dilettante” when it was learned that she was unwilling to forsake her Buddhist beliefs.
Cruise post-Cruz was apparently tired of having these ecclesiastical pillow fights interfere with his sex life: he needed a devout Scientologist to sleep with.
THE SAME TYPE OF GLAMOROUS BRUNETTE AS PENÉLOPE CRUZ, THE IRANIAN-BORN WOMAN SEEMED PERFECT.
BUT SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND.
Thus began an elaborate auditioning process, the sources say, to find him a drop-dead-beautiful true believer to share his life, someone who would not object to having the mercurial Miscavige as a powerful presence in the relationship.
Miscavige’s wife, Shelly, was put in charge of the top-secret project, they tell me, and the ruse was to call in actresses from the organization’s rolls, tell them they were being given the honor of auditioning for a new training film, and then ask them some curious questions, such as: What do you think of Tom Cruise?
It’s not like you only have to please your husband—you have to toe the line for all Scientology,” explains Marc Headley, a Scientologist from age seven, who tells me he watched a number of the dozens of three-to-four-minute audition videotapes when he was executive producer of Golden Era Productions, Scientology’s in-house studio.
The timing was especially delicate, for Cruise was burrowing deeper and deeper into the church, and Miscavige was actively pushing him.
Scientology spokespeople deny that there was any such special project.
They also deny that Kidman was considered a Suppressive Person, or that they objected to Cruz’s religious beliefs, or that Cruise’s children took a course on how to identify Suppressive Persons.
There can be no underestimating how valuable Cruise was to Scientology.
Both men had humble beginnings.
Cruise, who is 50, came from a broken family and was on his own by the age of 18.
He joined Scientology in 1986, when he was 24, and he credits its study methods with helping him overcome dyslexia.
He has gone on to make more than 30 films and reign as one of Hollywood’s top stars for nearly three decades.
His films over the years have grossed almost $7 billion worldwide, and his last one, Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, brought in $700 million on its own.
This year he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood’s highest-paid actor, with earnings of $75 million.
Miscavige, two years older and a couple of inches shorter than Cruise, began working with L.
Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, as an assistant cameraman in 1977, when he was 17.
Neither Cruise nor Miscavige attended college; Miscavige was a high-school dropout.
By 1982, Miscavige was Hubbard’s top aide, and in 1987, the year after Hubbard’s death, he became the leader of the whole organization.
Scientology has claimed to have eight million adherents around the world.
Many question that figure, some putting it as low as 40,000.
In October 1993, during the first year of the Clinton administration, Scientology received its disputed status as a tax-exempt church.
The organization employed the services of a former deputy assistant attorney general, Gerald Feffer, then a member of Washington’s well-connected Williams & Connolly law firm.
Feffer’s wife, Monique Yingling, is still a top lawyer for Scientology.
Perhaps the most notable joint public appearance of Cruise and Miscavige occurred weeks after the opening in Madrid, when Miscavige conferred the organization’s Freedom Medal of Valor—an award created specially for Cruise—on the star at a black-tie ceremony outside London.
Cruise appeared both in person and on a bizarre videotape—wearing a black turtleneck and extolling Scientology—that subsequently went up on the Internet.
Marty Rathbun says Miscavige clearly wanted to make sure that Cruise was securely locked in and unable to drift away, as he had during his marriage to Kidman.
All during that time, he claims, the organization got reports on the couple through members of their personal staff—devout Scientologists.
The staff “was reporting every single detail going on in the house during the entire marriage with Nicole—how they were getting along, their disputes, what he was doing movie-wise, and his relations in Hollywood.
One assistant was always saying, ‘Reach back.
Auditing is a very big deal in Scientology, its expensive version of Roman Catholic confession, administered by an auditor posing hundreds of questions to a paying subject holding on to two metal canisters wired to an Electropsychometer, or E-Meter, which measures the body’s reactions to the questions somewhat as a lie detector does.
Subjects are encouraged to bring up any disturbing past memories or transgressions and get them out in order to be “cleared” to go up the Bridge to Total Freedom, through many levels leading to eternal spiritual happiness, a process that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Ron Hubbard’s secret writings, which reveal the church’s most sacred beliefs—how 75 million years ago a galactic emperor named Xenu sent millions of frozen souls on spaceships from his overpopulated kingdom to the bases of volcanoes on Earth; the volcanoes were hydrogen-bombed, and today the scattered and reincarnated spiritual beings, or “thetans,” pick up human bodies as “containers” to inhabit.
Their excess emotional baggage can haunt the human hosts, however, so it needs to be cleared out.
That’s when the penny drops,” Marc Headley tells me.
T.
III level before he followed Kidman’s lead away from the organization.
Numerous sources say that Kidman, a Catholic, was never considered safe by Scientology, because her father, in Australia, is a psychologist, by definition a Suppressive Person, since Scientology rejects psychiatry and all psychotropic drugs.
Scientology representatives deny that Kidman was ever considered unsafe.
C.
C.
FLASH The press cannot get enough of the story.
After Cruise’s marriage with Kidman collapsed, in early 2001, and his relationship with Cruz faded, there were to be no more slipups.
Rathbun says that he audited Cruise, and according to Claire Headley, who backed up Rathbun, unbeknownst to Cruise, his confessionals were secretly taped by cameras hidden in a lamp and in a piece of furniture.
Marc Headley adds, “We used hidden cameras behind mirrors, in picture frames, in alarm clocks.
I know every single covert camera made.
At the end of each of the auditing sessions, which covered Cruise’s entire life, Rathbun would give a written report to Miscavige, who, according to Claire Headley, also received the videotapes, which she says she observed being delivered to him.
Today, Rathbun states that disagreements over Scientology were at the heart of Cruise’s two previous divorces, from the actress Mimi Rogers, who was also a Scientologist, and from Kidman.
There were allegations and counter-allegations about fidelity, but the central problem was Nicole did not want to deal with Scientology,” he says.
I participated in the Mimi divorce and in the Nic divorce.
Both women got cold on Miscavige.
Miscavige eagerly awaited the Cruise reports and those of other high-profile Scientology members at his Gold Base headquarters, in Hemet.
According to several sources, he often read them out loud to entertain whomever he was with.
I know he did it with  Lisa Marie Presley, back in ’95, when she was married to Michael Jackson, and I know he did it a number of times with Kirstie Alley.
I saw and heard him,” Claire Headley tells me.
He loved to dish about celebrities,” says Tom De Vocht, Miscavige’s former close aide, who went on to run Scientology’s large operation in Clearwater, Florida, where Scientologists from all over the world go to study.
According to De Vocht, Miscavige—often joined by his wife, Shelly—would whip out a bottle of Macallan scotch at two or three in the morning in the Officers Lounge, play backgammon, and read the Cruise reports with a running commentary.
He’s probably got a lot of embarrassing material,” De Vocht says, adding that Miscavige’s comments were usually about Cruise’s sex life.
All the while, Miscavige claimed to be Cruise’s best friend.
The audition process for the next Mrs.
Cruise did not yield much at first, according to the Headleys.
By the fall of 2004, they say, dozens of the organization’s members had been run through the video process and considered unsuitable.
Cruise himself was reportedly unable to entice a number of beautiful, well-known actresses—including Sofía Vergara and Scarlett Johansson—to accept his devotion to Scientology.
Finally, however, according to several sources, the screeners at Gold Base headquarters came upon a believer they thought could actually wear the glass slipper: a gorgeous, petite, Iranian-born woman in her mid-20s who had been raised in London and whose mother was also a Scientologist.
The same type of glamorous brunette as Penélope Cruz—five feet three, 100 pounds—she had graduated with honors in biological sciences from the University of California at Irvine, had plans to go to medical school, and was an accomplished violinist.
She seemed perfect.
But she had a boyfriend.
Nazanin Boniadi, 25, who had not yet become the human-rights activist for Amnesty International and the actor she is today, was summoned in October 2004 to meet an important church official at the Celebrity Centre International, in Hollywood.
She arrived to find the high-ranking Greg Wilhere, who, according to a knowledgeable source, told her she had been selected for a very hush-hush mission that would entail meeting dignitaries around the world.
He added that if she succeeded she would be helping to make the world a better place.
Thus began a month-long preparation process that entailed her getting audited every day and telling Wilhere her innermost secrets, including every detail of her sex life.
Nobody who had been in a threesome, for example, would be considered—a rule that apparently eliminated one candidate.
T.
V—beyond the Wall of Fire—she embraced the church’s motto “Think for Yourself” and threw herself into every task she was assigned.
Wilhere, meanwhile, had frequent whispered phone conversations with the person he called “the project director,” says the source.
Early on, he sent Boniadi to a photo shoot, which revealed that she wore braces and that her naturally black hair had red highlights.
She was told that she had to lose the braces and make her hair one color to emphasize her ethnicity.
It didn’t matter that she still had a good six months to wear the braces; they had to go.
So did her boyfriend.
Boniadi had been dating an Iranian man and was eagerly looking forward to becoming engaged.
She had brought him into Scientology.
According to the knowledgeable source, a Scientology official asked what it would take to make her break off with him.
According to a number of people who have heard her story from her, Boniadi was then shown confidential information from her boyfriend’s auditing files; she chose to end the relationship.
She was crushed,” one of her confidants told me.
Next she had to sit down and prepare a 20-page, single-spaced essay on what she wanted and needed in her life in terms of a partner, family, and work to satisfy her goals and aspirations.
P.
That’s how important this project is,” one official said.
Boniadi never received a copy of the agreement, according to the source, though she several times asked for one.
Meanwhile, Claire Headley says, she had been assigned by Shelly Miscavige to buy $5,000 worth of new suits and shoes for Wilhere, who would temporarily trade his Sea Org nylon pants for designer clothes in order to fly first-class with Boniadi to New York the first week in November.
Upon arriving there, they checked into the Parker Meridien.
According to the knowledgeable source, Wilhere suggested that the young woman get a good night’s sleep, for the special project for which she had been put through hoops for a month was finally about to begin.
The next day, their first stop was in the theater district, at Scientology’s New York center.
Wilhere took her to the deserted second floor, and while she was facing away from the entrance, she heard a voice say, “Holy shit.
It was Tom Cruise.
According to the knowledgeable source, Boniadi was incredulous that Scientology would set her up.
She was shocked, and she felt manipulated, but she was also flattered that Tom Cruise would have wanted to know so much about her and then shown up to meet her.
Given her Iranian background, she sensed that this was possibly going to be an arranged marriage, particularly when Wilhere allegedly told her, “This is Mr.
Cruise.
Mr.
Cruise, for his part, was apparently determined to make a great first impression.
Before leaving California for her first trip to the East Coast, Boniadi had been asked for her idea of the perfect first date.
She had said sushi and ice-skating.
Voilà!
But first, according to the knowledgeable source, Cruise and Wilhere took Boniadi on a tour of the Empire State Building, along with Tommy Davis, a top aide in Scientology, his then wife, Nadine, and the woman who would become his next wife, Jessica Rodriguez, as well as Cruise’s sister Lee Anne and her daughter, Lauren.
Then the party went for sushi at the stylish restaurant Nobu.
The skating rink at Rockefeller Center had been closed to the public so that the group could skate without interference.
Cruise and Boniadi spent the first night together but did not have sex, according to several sources.
Nevertheless, Cruise is said to have told her, “I’ve never felt this way before,” at the Trump Tower, where he and the entourage had taken an entire floor.
The next day Boniadi went to the set of War of the Worlds, in upstate Athens, New York, where Cruise paraded her around and kissed her in front of 200 extras.
In the limo back to the city without the star, Davis gave Boniadi another confidentiality agreement to sign, this one specifically about Cruise.
When she balked, the knowledgeable source says, Davis told her that if she ever did anything to harm Cruise she would have him to deal with.
She signed but was not given a copy of that agreement, either.
From that point forward, through November and December, Boniadi and Cruise were practically inseparable, and she was soon head over heels in love.
Cruise overwhelmed her with the intensity of his affection, and he apparently liked it to be on public display.
Virtually their only time alone, though, was in the bedroom.
The rest of the time they were surrounded by the entourage.
The degree of control Boniadi was subjected to by Cruise and the organization was mind-boggling, according to several sources.
For the first three weeks she was isolated and not permitted to communicate with anyone.
Despite the fact that her parents were deeply worried, she was allowed to tell them only that she was in New York on a special Scientology project, never that she was with Cruise.
If Cruise found fault with anything she said or did, according to the knowledgeable source, he immediately reported it to Tommy Davis or a member of the staff, and she would then be audited about it.
This process started with the first words she ever spoke to him, “Very well done,” about his receiving Scientology’s Freedom Medal of Valor.
Evidently that was not sufficiently doting; according to the source, her “Very well done” implied that Cruise was her junior.
Though the first month on the project was bliss, by the second month Boniadi was more and more often found wanting.
Cruise’s hairstylist, Chris McMillan, was brought in to work on her hair; in addition, says the source, Cruise wanted Boniadi’s incisor teeth filed down.
Finally, she was allowed to tell her mother that she was involved with Tom Cruise.
Her mother, a hairdresser, did not like the fact she was now out of the picture, not even allowed to do her daughter’s hair, and she frowned upon the age difference between her daughter and the then 42-year-old actor.
She reportedly also had to sign a confidentiality agreement, but she never reached the point where she qualified to meet Cruise.
By late November, Boniadi felt even more isolated as she and Cruise flew to Telluride, along with the entourage, whose sole purpose, it seemed, was to keep Cruise happy and to let him know how much money he was bringing into the organization, how many people joined Scientology every day because of him, and how much he was doing to save the planet.
In Telluride, Boniadi was audited frequently by Jessica Rodriguez.
Shortly before New Year’s, David and Shelly Miscavige arrived.
One afternoon when everyone was on snowmobiles, Boniadi, who was feeling sick from her period and from the altitude, fell off her vehicle and was badly bruised.
According to the source, she was in excruciating pain, but Scientologists do not believe in medicating in such circumstances.
She asked to go back to the house, where she burst into tears, believing that she was completely shut off; her only source of money was a credit card issued in the name of Cruise’s production company.
After lying down to rest, she was told that she had to go downstairs and help entertain the Miscaviges.
David Miscavige speaks rapidly, and she had trouble following his American English.
That was a fatal mistake.
Miscavige took that as an insult,” says a confidant of the woman’s.
The upshot was that Cruise was furious with her for offending Miscavige.
After the Miscaviges left the next day, Boniadi was summoned by Davis into Cruise’s office, where the actor delivered a blistering denunciation about her disrespect of the chairman of the board.
According to his representative, “Mr.

GOOD-BYE Cruise s eye is trained on a distant Holmes.
Things were never the same after that.
Boniadi flew back with the staff the next day to Los Angeles and moved into Cruise’s house, but she spent her time confessing her transgressions at the Celebrity Centre.
When Cruise arrived, he was withdrawn and barely acknowledged her, though they still shared a bedroom.
During the third week of January, Boniadi was asked to pack a bag and move into the Celebrity Centre.
The special project and their pre-arranged meeting in New York were never acknowledged to Boniadi by Cruise, according to the knowledgeable source.
Her parting glimpse of Cruise was seeing him working out in his home gym on her way out.
When she asked why Tom would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.
Boniadi was then packed off to Scientology’s Mecca, the Flag building, in Clearwater, Florida, according to the source, where, thanks to the generosity of Cruise, she could get counseling and atone for her errors.
Strictly forbidden to mention her relationship with Cruise to anyone, she spent much of her time crying, devastated that her entire previous life had been stripped away.
Cruise’s video from the Freedom Medal of Valor ceremony played near her in a constant loop.
One night, the knowledgeable source says, Boniadi ran into Cruise himself, who had come with his children to Flag for auditing.
She did not see him at first in the dark, but he invited her to sit down on a bench in a public area.
Tommy Davis was standing nearby.
Boniadi had been taught in her counseling that if someone is constantly upset after breaking up—as she was—it is because she did something wrong.
She was also aware that anything she said would come out the next day in auditing.
She replied only, “Well, you see.
At one point, says the source, Bella and Connor approached her and asked when she was coming back to the house.
Finally, Boniadi broke down and told an inquiring friend why she was weeping all the time.
According to the knowledgeable source, the friend promptly wrote up a 10-page “Knowledge Report” on her, and for more than two months Boniadi’s punishment was to scrub toilets with a toothbrush on her hands and knees, clean bathroom tiles with acid, and dig ditches in the middle of the night.
She was also harangued for hours and made to confess what a horrible human being she was.
After that she was sent out to hawk L.

I firsthand observed the type of control from David Miscavige into Tom Cruise’s household.
I was used to build a limo from scratch, to customize a million-dollar trailer.

There were two kids messing it up—Bella spilling nail polish all over the rug.

Christmas of 2007 at Telluride, overseeing the maintenance of the place, as he had done at Alpine.
Every night he sat at the dinner table with Tom, Katie, and their guests.
Suri was just a baby, a “bundle of joy” to all.
Katie Holmes all over the TV studio before dragging her onstage, he was beginning to attract unwanted media attention to Scientology.
He was also becoming a headache for Paramount Pictures, whose executives had expected the publicity campaign for War of the Worlds to focus strictly on the movie.
At that point he and Holmes had known each other only a month, and in July she got pregnant.
In March 2004, he had fired Pat Kingsley, his tough and powerful publicist of 14 years, who took a dim view of his proselytizing, and replaced her with his sister Lee Anne.
Moreover, the Internet was becoming a thorn in the side of Scientology, which strictly controlled what its hierarchy at Sea Org could access.
Most Sea Org members lived in a total bubble where world news was concerned.
Normal education was minimized because of Scientology’s belief in reincarnation—everyone was already millions of years old.
Children of Sea Org members born into Scientology before the 1987 ban on those members’ having children went to what Scientologists call “Chinese school,” where they had to memorize long passages of L.
Ron Hubbard’s teachings.
I asked Claire Headley.
She did not know what I meant.
On the 2004 video on which Miscavige presents Cruise with Scientology’s Freedom Medal of Valor, the two men salute first each other and then a portrait of L.
Ron Hubbard.
An unauthorized copy of the video went viral, and it was widely made fun of.
Scientology went into overdrive to have the video removed from the Internet, which encouraged the hacker group Anonymous to single out the organization as a special target.
Claire Headley, who worked on the film, says that Miscavige personally edited it.
We took six hours once on just a nod of Tom Cruise’s head,” she tells me.
T.
IX, which makes everyone think he is the reincarnation of L.
Ron Hubbard.
When Tom Cruise comes to pay homage, Stan tells him he prefers the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite—the teenage hero of the 2004 comedy—which so upsets Cruise that he locks himself in the closet with John Travolta, and they refuse to come out.
Mike Rinder told me he was sent by Miscavige to meet with Cruise’s agents at CAA and with Bert Fields, his lawyer, to demand that they read Brad Grey, the new head of Paramount, the riot act, since Comedy Central and Paramount are both owned by Sumner Redstone’s Viacom.
There was to be no rerun of the episode, Rinder told them, or else.
According to an internal Scientology document that Rinder provided me with, the threatening message was very clear: “This is a twoway street.
Other documents include demands to try to kill pending Los Angeles Times and Rolling Stone stories on Scientology  both of which ran , as well as a proposed deal to kill an NBC Dateline piece planned on Scientology in exchange for an exclusive interview with Tom Cruise on another program.
Rinder estimates that he met 10 times during a five-year period with Cruise’s people to demand that they get unfavorable stories about Scientology killed.
Cruise’s ostensible reason for appearing with Oprah was to publicize War of the Worlds, his new, $132 million movie.
On the Universal lot, Cruise had pulled strings to have a Scientology tent erected—against the studio’s policy of not having any outside groups present during filming.
A month after the Oprah show, Cruise appeared on the Today show and challenged Matt Lauer regarding the use of psychotropic drugs, in the process criticizing Brooke Shields for taking medication to relieve postpartum depression.
Rinder asks me.
He’s appearing on national TV acting like a loony tune.
I thought it was a disaster—what’s going on?
But Miscavige is basically fist-pumping: ‘He’s not backed off!
The world saw it differently.
A cover line on the August 2005 issue of Vanity Fair read, DOMINICK DUNNE: HAS TOM CRUISE LOST HIS MARBLES?
I ask Rinder if he ever dared to voice his opinions about Cruise’s strange behavior.
I could never say a word,” he replies.
Many people have wondered about the dynamic between Miscavige and Cruise.
Rinder calls their relationship “unnaturally close,” adding that he does not mean to imply homosexuality.
Yet, he says, the relationship “is not what you would expect between someone who claims to be a leader of the church and one of its adherents.
Miscavige treats Tom Cruise like his best buddy and confidant, his number two.
Suri was born in April 2006.
The gossip columnists had had a field day when it became known that Cruise had purchased his own sonogram machine to track the pregnancy.
Mission: Impossible III came out in May.
By August, Sumner Redstone had had enough.
The South Park episode had not been rerun before Mission: Impossible III’s release, but Cruise’s lucrative contract with Paramount was not renewed either—a nightmare for both the studio, dependant on Cruise for its Mission: Impossible franchise, and for Cruise.
Much of the negative publicity was quickly wiped away, however, when the first pictures of an adorable Suri were published in Vanity Fair’s October issue, with an accompanying story on the family’s still-unwedded bliss.
Like Princess Diana with Prince Charles, Katie Holmes had a mad schoolgirl crush on the older Tom Cruise, and, to many close observers, like Diana she had a third person in her marriage.
At Holmes’s fairy-tale wedding, at Odescalchi Castle, in Italy, in 2006, David Miscavige did not officiate as the head of the Church of Scientology; rather, he was Cruise’s best man.
Katie’s best man, it turned out, was her father, who had negotiated a prenuptial agreement for his youngest daughter that reportedly filled five bankers’ boxes.
Because of it, when Katie Holmes made her bombshell announcement late last June that she was divorcing Tom Cruise, the case was able to be resolved in a mere 11 days.
As TomKat flooded the tabloids in 2005, Marc Headley, who had started working for Life & Style Weekly as a Scientology expert, heard that the editors had a source who said that Martin Holmes, a Catholic and a divorce lawyer in Toledo, Ohio, wanted to know how his daughter could escape Scientology’s clutches.
Headley’s advice was to speak out publicly against Scientology and be labeled a Suppressive Person so that his daughter would have to choose between him and Cruise.
Then Katie became pregnant,” Headley says, “and I was told, ‘Forget it.
According to Jared Shapiro, Life & Style Weekly’s editorial director, who worked with Headley, “To say we were talking to a family member would be accurate,” though he would not name that member.
When Headley published his book, Blown for Good: Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology, about his split from the organization, in 2010, he sent a copy to Holmes at his law firm.
Marty Rathbun, whose blog is closely followed by disaffected Scientologists, adds that he personally did not reach out to Martin Holmes but that others did.
He says, “Of everything out there, blogs included, he is aware.
Many of the entourage that was around for Nazanin Boniadi’s brief relationship with Cruise stayed around during his marriage to Katie Holmes.
The couple never lived alone.
Like Boniadi, Holmes disappeared for a couple weeks after she and Cruise met, and she distanced herself from old friends.
Jessica Rodriguez became her handler, too.
Unlike Nicole Kidman’s acting career, however, Holmes’s never really took off during her marriage to Cruise, while his went on unabated.
In their seven years together, Cruise made nine movies, which cost nearly a billion dollars and required shooting all over the world.
One of these, Jack Reacher, a thriller—and another possible Paramount franchise—is coming out before Christmas, and Oblivion, a futuristic science-fiction saga produced by Universal, will premiere next spring.
Production has already begun on yet another big-budget, science-fiction project, All You Need Is Kill, for Warner Bros.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on Cruise’s box-office appeal.
Given his long commitment to Scientology and the demands of his career, Cruise has very little wiggle room.
Life at his side is similarly circumscribed.
Two years ago, at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, I sat next to Holmes at a Vanity Fair table, and Cruise sat across from us.
All through the meal, people streamed up, asking for pictures and autographs.
Scientologists believe that divorce should be handled inside the church; members are not supposed to sue one another.
The fact that Holmes blindsided Cruise with the divorce and was able to keep primary custody of Suri and enroll her in a private school would be automatic grounds for disconnection if she were married to any other Scientologist—many hundreds of whom have suffered deeply for years because of mandated separation from their families.
By being able to stay connected to Suri and Katie, Cruise proves once again to be a privileged exception.
Nevertheless, many Scientology mothers I spoke to warn that although Holmes has won a battle she has not necessarily won the war.
Scientologists, “Katie has denied Suri her spiritual eternity in the church.
There’s no chance for her now.
Why would Katie deny their daughter her spiritual freedom?
She warns, “If he loves his daughter, he will never give up .
Just as Princess Diana won the paparazzi over to her side by learning how to feed them a steady supply of photo ops, Holmes seems to be winning the media battle through frequent outings in New York with Suri in tow.
Not to be outdone, Cruise has attracted photographers as the literal Disney World Dad, showering Suri with toys and taking her by helicopter from New York to the Hamptons, and after that to the Magic Kingdom costumed as the Little Mermaid.
By being dropped publicly without warning, Cruise was made to feel the sting he had bestowed on a number of women.
Furthermore, though he is his church’s putative savior, he has probably brought more invasive attention to Scientology than anyone else.
David Miscavige cannot be pleased.
Meanwhile, the hunt for the next Mrs.
Cruise may already be on.

Anonymous activists milling around the entrance to Saint Hill Manor.
Saint Hill Manor isn’t your average British beauty spot.
Firstly, although one part of it looks like a Norman fortress—all round barrel turrets and the kind of pointy windows you’d see in an Asterix comic strip—that extension was actually built in 1968.
Secondly, its centerpiece is a large statue of a man carrying a shield decorated with a symbol you might recognize from the placards at Anonymous rallies.
Thirdly, it used to be full of Scientologists.
Saint Hill is the last great bastion of Scientology in the UK.
The original manor house was built in the small West Sussex town of East Grinstead in the 18th century and purchased in 1959 by L.
Ron Hubbard.
His decision to turn it into Scientology’s British head office made it a Mecca for followers of Hubbard’s philosophy, of which there are now said to be 10 million  this number is disputed by basically anyone who isn’t a signed up Scientologist .
Jon Atack.
Atack, who has repeatedly challenged the membership figures posited by Scientology’s top brass, told me, “Scientology was never big business in the UK.
The last census showed just over 2,000 UK members.
I grew up near East Grinstead, a town that represents Middle England at its most repressed.
Constituents are represented in Westminster by Nicholas “Bunter” Soames, Winston Churchill’s grandson, and the nearest chain supermarket is almost ten miles away.
As a child, I was forced to play rugby at a club whose pitches were straight over the road from Saint Hill.
We used to hear whisperings about the Scientologists  and Mormons  in the area, but I don’t remember them amounting to much more than the  kind of standard xenophobic chatter that traditionally greets a large influx of Americans.
Before Tom Cruise and John Travolta outed themselves, nobody really cared about the group of alien worshippers.
But Saint Hill used to be the bustling international headquarters of Scientology.
Atack was there between 1975 and 1977, and then again from 1982 to 1983.
It was fairly busy then, with about 180 staff and usually about a hundred students,” he tells me.
But, despite a weekly service, there were no pretensions to religion.
With hundreds of Scientologists  “mainly Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, and Israelis”, says Atack  descending on East Grinstead, the town began to entice followers of all sorts of alternative spiritualities.
East Grinstead might prefer visitors to focus on attractions like its beautiful 14th century timber high street, or the local coffee shop owned by Peter Andre, but it was better known for years as the UK base of Scientology, Mormonism, Opus Dei, and Rosicrucianism.
In London, Scientologists have shown no sign of acknowledging their diminished following.
In the last decade they’ve opened both a major church near St Paul’s Cathedral and the Dianetics and Scientology Life Improvement Center on Tottenham Court Road.
Wedged in between the various shops selling digital radios and second-hand tripods, this is intended to be a place for silent reflection and the acquisition of knowledge.
A polite young man with gelled blond hair and a thick northern accent greets me at the door.
He gives me a guided tour of the center’s three video chambers—all of them lined with copies of Hubbard’s seminal text, Dianetics, in every language from Arabic to Zulu—and offers me tea and coffee.
I’m charmed.
So charmed, in fact, that I settle in on a sofa to watch a documentary about the life of Lafayette Ron Hubbard.
The Dianetics and Scientology Life Improvement Center on Tottenham Court Road.
It’s worth noting, at this point, that I’m the only person here.
Every passerby has something to say about the center, whether it’s a derogatory quip or a specific South Park quote, but nobody goes in.
Perhaps that’s why my new buddy is so friendly—he spends all his days trapped inside an empty museum, the informational videos endlessly repeating themselves like some kind of nightmarish Groundhog Day.
It must be nice to have someone to talk to for once.
Irene Thrupp, L Ron Hubbard’s personal secretary during his residence at Saint Hill, tells me her story from the video screen.
She’s a posh old lady who was charmed by “Ron” and his acquisition of expensive desk chairs.
There’s something very sad about the way that Irene venerates this man to an empty congregation.
Saint Hill is not what it was in Irene s.
I’d chatted to an elderly East Grinstead resident about her reflections of the place.
She remembers the annual “Medieval Fayre” and skiffle concerts held in the grounds, back when the Scientologists knew how to throw a decent party, concluding by telling me that I looked “susceptible” and warning me not to get sucked in.
But what is there to get sucked into?
Sure, the man at the center is very friendly—the kind of guy who’d fix your printer for free—but there’s nothing here to actively participate in.
I ask what my first step to enlightenment should be.
Err,” he puzzles, as though he s never been asked this question before.
Question 1: Do you make thoughtless remarks or accusations that you later regret?
Yes, I do.
Question 88: If we were invading another country, would you feel sympathetic towards conscientious objectors in this country?
Who’s  we ?
Question 92: Are you a slow eater?
Defiantly so.
Question 98: Would you use corporal punishment on a child aged ten if it refused to obey you?
Wait, what?
This is the test that the Church of Scientology uses to determine whether you can be saved by their purification schemes, or whether you’re insufficiently pro-discipline.
As initiations go, it’s hardly that enticing for a faith that’s already been battered by bad publicity.
I think that the combination of South Park and Anonymous has turned away potential recruits from the new generation,” says Atack, musing on the statistics from the most recent UK census.
One of those websites is “Operation Clambake,” an anti-Scientology organization so widely followed that it even has its own Wikipedia page.
I spoke to its founder, Norwegian activist Andreas Heldal-Lund, to ask him why he thinks Scientology has failed in the UK.
Scientology aims for the universe, but only has a net big enough to catch a limited number of fish,” he tells me, somewhat confusingly.
Heldal-Lund s organization has captured the attention of what he calls “the nerdy early implementers of the internet”.
And that, he believes, is where Scientology has shot itself in the foot.
They lost the big and most important battle: the internet,” he says.
Despite what Atack and Heldal-Lund have told me, and the dismal emptiness of the Scientology venues I’ve visited in the UK, I can t help but feel sorry for Britain s Scientologists.
It might have a bizarrely corporate hierarchy for what’s ostensibly a real, proper, serious religion, but on a basic level there are impressionable people who actually believe what they’ve been told.
They filled out the personality test, discovered they were pathetic mortals, and were told that the only way to rebuild themselves was through Scientology.
I’d argue we should sympathize with this lot, rather than constantly berate them.
It s not like their nonsense, made-up religion is any more ridiculous than all the other made-up religions.
Scientology has always been a poor fit for the UK.
It’s a phenomenon better suited to wealthy, tanned Americans who’ve spent their entire lives being told they can be anything they want to be if they throw enough money around, not the Irene Thrupps of this world, or the poor northern lad giving tours of the Dianetics Center.
Saint Hill might present itself as the headquarters of Scientology in the UK, but that clearly doesn t count for much.
The manicured lawns, placid ponds, and Travelodge interiors have been left to fester, completely rejected by a nation that can t even deal with moderate Protestantism any more.

Sorry, Tom Cruise and John Travolta — the Church of Scientology is on the lookout for new “normal” faces.
The high-profile church is planning to shoot TV commercials and is looking for fresh faces to lure new recruits.
Using Tom Cruise and John Travolta and other famous faces hasn’t resulted in new members.
So now they are ditching that approach and focusing on people that look normal,” a casting director who has seen the call sheet tells Confidenti@l.
The ‘job’ is offering a $250 day rate and no residuals,” we’re told.
Thus, non-union.
It’s a one-time buyout, which will be shot on the streets of NYC in one day.
Should the Church of Scientology decide to go with a more famous face, they have plenty from which to choose.
Kirstie Alley, Giovanni Ribisi and Juliette Lewis are among the stars who have been linked to what’s often called the “UFO Religion” founded by science fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard in 1953.

Bald guy – Marc Yager.
Highest ecclesiastical officer of scientology’s ‘mother church’  church of scientology international .
Watchdog Committee Chairman.

Fellow with video camera.
Dave Bloomberg.
Long-time Scientology Executive Strata member – the alleged highest management body in church of scientology international.
3.
The woman is Jenny Linson Devocht.
She is a close personal aide to David Miscavige – the self-proclaimed pope of scientology.
She is also an intimate friend of Miscavige.
Because of scientology’s bunker down response to public exposure of Miscavige’s creation of a culture of violence at the highest levels of scientology, including maintenance of concentration and torture prisons, people have been in mystery as to what scientology management has been up to for the past several years.
This video gives a partial answer.
It is remarkable in that Miscavige has spent millions of dollars to create a wall of perjury before Texas courts claiming that he, and the highest levels of scientology management, have no knowledge – and have not authorized – these same type of ambush, in-your-face tactics against me and my family that have been carried out for years now.
There are those who dismiss L.
The complexity, the breadth, and the duration of Hubbard’s alleged fraudulent scheme would be a virtual impossibility for any mere mortal to accomplish.
At the opposite extreme pole hard core scientologists truly believe that L.
They have trained their own minds to reject any information even tangentially relating to mind or spirit that does not come from Hubbard’s mouth or pen.
Likewise, the Ron-quoting scientologist’s aggressive certitude serves to reinforce the anti-scientologists’ views that Hubbard’s work is good for nothing more than creating unthinking, conformist zealots.
As with any hotly contested, complex issue denialists cling hard to simple answers that make them comfortable with putting difficult questions out of sight and out of mind.
It seems that in the scientology world L.
Ron Hubbard is either God or Satan.
But, if one listens without embracing one side or the other the minute it seems to agree with one’s prejudices and intelligently looks for oneself, one will generally find that the truth lies somewhere between the polar extremes.
We will explore the reasons why those affected by scientology in the long-term continue to act out scientology’s patented us vs.
That stage was well summed up by James W.
New expectations, qualitatively different disciplines and a host of difficult decisions are the requirements with which societies greet the now more womanly or manly adolescent.
In this cliquishness they can be quite cruel as they exclude those who do not share this common element.
By continually communicating constructs as reality with a convincing combination of charisma and certainty, Hubbard manages to make scientologists buy into a universe view that is completely encompassed within Fowler’s adolescent development perspective.
That culture convinces the individual to assign any and every personal development along the Fowler schema  — or by any other standard — to the brilliance of Hubbard and scientology.
Likewise, it includes sophisticated and complex analyses for blaming any regression or depression on perceived enemies of scientology, directly or indirectly.
All of these dichotomy creating mis-assignment of causation devices serve to reinforce the adolescent, denialist universe view taught in scientology.
The adolescent stage of faith universe view is so thoroughly ingrained in the sub conscious of the scientologist that even when an individual manages to disconnect from the scientology organization he or she often continues to act with the adopted us vs.
The former cult member can gravitate toward groups of independent, former, and even anti-scientologists who act in the same cliquish and cruel manner that they did while actively participating in scientology.
It is a culture of facile appointment of enemies and easy bandwagon riding with those perceived to share trivial commonalities.
But, for the reasons outlined thus far, it is a step those involved in scientology culture find difficult to navigate.
Yet, by observation there are no more drama obsessed people than scientologists.
Most of this essay was drafted prior to me seeing this latest scientology, well, drama.
When you get to the end of the post you will understand why this news prompted me to push the ‘post’ button.
It is used to label any behavior that is not upbeat, Stepford or Truman Show like, positivity.
It has its source in the mind ‘technology’ presented by  L.
To a scientologist,  the poor, unknowing non-scientologist doesn’t even realize that a great percentage of his behavior, his choices, and his actions are really to greater or lesser degree ‘dramatizations’ of the emotions and post-hypnotic commands buried in engrams.
Wrong.
The drama is so intense that Hubbard claims that if the unprepared are exposed to it, they will drop dead on the spot.
All social sciences are mere dramatizations of ideas that were implanted into beings’ heads 75 million years ago.
And like any good drama, the scientology one includes its nemeses.
That includes all psychologists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists.
And, by extension the manufacturers of psychotropic medications: pharmaceutical companies.
Psychs are overtly targeted for ‘annihilation’, ‘obliteration’ and ‘extinction’ by scientology.
In such a state they can become wild-eyed and, well, dramatic about matters that would seem to have little significance to anyone but them.
A couple years later Tom Cruise invited Brooke Shields and her husband to his scientology wedding to Katie Holmes in Italy so that she could see first-hand those who really know about the mind.
Brooke graciously accepted and flew to Europe with her husband to attend.
Tom’s hand-picked high-level scientology officiating minister was Commander Norman F.
Starkey.
Starkey was given a furlough from a scientology concentration and torture camp at which he was serving time in order to conduct the wedding.
Starkey promptly got drunk, and overtly hit on Brooke Shields.
She and her husband were so offended, they complained to Cruise’s best man, scientology supreme leader David Miscavige.
Rather than take any iota of responsibility like a man, Cruise went mute and as we can divine from Juliette Lewis’ rants took solace in the fact his conduct really did not happen because in fact the forces of evil want him silenced.
Perhaps he shut up in order to dutifully comply with those terrifying forces?
In fact, unwilling to admit the failure of scientology to erase the subconscious, Hubbard came up with a new explanation for the continuing subconscious dramas Clears continue to play out.
That is a science fiction mythology that anthropomorphizes every sub-conscious thought the Clear has.
And so after spending perhaps years to attain the state of Clear the false identity stripping starts anew and this time continues until the scientologist dies.
The only thing they do purport to know for certain is this: those ventures were even further into the deeper past than even quadrillions of years.
That is indisputable fact if Ron’s last two most trusted aides can be trusted as they were by Ron.
Pat Broeker did so at the L.
They presented the same full 14 ½” sheet of paper covered in numbers in L.
Scientology’s elite of the elite claimed that was a date Hubbard was addressing in his post-OT VIII self auditing.
To date they have apparently failed to create those revelations.
So, the only thing the world knows about scientology’s as yet uncodified levels is that they direct attention to dates in the past that are so ancient the numbers alone can fill a foolscap sheet of paper.
While Miscavige and Broeker promised OT levels IX, X, and ‘so on’, the leading independent scientology organization offers fifty-five  55  such levels beyond Clear – or four and one half times the invitations to regress yet further into the past.
That this cognitive dissonant state  present vs.
A dispassionate and informed study of Hubbard’s research and discovery path reveals it to be an inevitability.
In order to do so one must confront that which created his descent into the human condition.
Thus, the central practice of scientology is a form of abreaction therapy that returns one to and addresses each step one took down the ladder from his native condition.
Unlike more conventional psychotherapies, scientology’s abreaction practice is intended to be, and is in practice, interminable.
It preaches that the unraveling of all the quadrillions of years of falling from perfection is the only road to spiritual freedom, even the only means to fully wake up from insanity.
The belief in the holy grail lying in the deep past is firmly and cumulatively reinforced by every session one participates in that results in relief or release – or some other form of heightened emotion or consciousness –  by witnessing an incident from one’s past.
Yet, the words of scientology’s founder L.
He liberally dropped dates like millions, billions, trillions, quadrillions, and quadrillions to the infinite power years ago when reminiscing about his exploits and by positive suggestion those of his adherents.
In virtually all of Hubbard’s sci fi narratives beings possessed capabilities far exceeding anything known to humankind.
A.
One should never fear to hurt another person in a just cause  most particularly when that cause is the cause of the creator of the mental therapy he engages in .
B.
One should never withdraw his allegiance to any group to which he has pledged it, irrespective of how criminal and destructive he discovers that group might be  most particularly when that group is the one endowed with a monopoly on the mental therapy he is engaged in .
C.
One should never show compassion to the weak for to do so will worsen the weak and the strong attempting to lend a hand.
Only the ‘able’ ought be supported and assisted.
Like in social Darwinist thought it is justified by the arbitrary datum that only further empowerment of the elite will raise anyone else’s boat.
D.
That now considering oneself one of the elite, every time you engage in self-absorbed, introspective processes to make yourself feel better you are improving humankind’s lot.
A sort of imbued megalomaniac narcissism is effectuated re-enforcing a-c above.
E.
Personalities inclined to not go along with the mental therapy program and instead find fault with it ought to be disposed of permanently and with no slightest dent in one’s conscience for having done so.
In fact, this is the ingrained mindset and behavior pattern of a scientologist; and he or she will defend it as ferociously and instinctively as a she-gator protects her young.
Little compassion and much arrogant, vicious fault-finding and attempts to undermine espousers of opposing views often marks the interchange between them.
The subconscious  associative  mind system automatically rationalizes the content of its adopted narratives perpetuating the human proclivity toward creating, adopting and bolstering stories to make sense of the world.
The narratives’ matrices of associated ‘facts’ become the filter through which new information and perceptions are sensed and organized.
The auto-associating mind system prompts the individual to use his analytical faculties to further explain and justify its conclusions.
And when the person is convinced that there are no such processes present – as the ‘cleared’ scientologist is – his analytical system can become mighty reactionary itself.
Fantastic sums of money are invested into utilizing this knowledge to maintain the status quo and make populations more materialist-consumerist oriented to increase the dollars flowing toward the top of the wealth pyramid.
Like it or not, we live in a culture driven, fueled, and maintained by consultation to and application of the advices of the greatest minds in human psychology.
The knowledge utilized to keep the masses slaves to the current economic system demonstrates how an understanding of these mechanisms could make a hypnotic ‘therapy’ as discussed herein possible.
They are the very mechanisms used to make scientologists slaves to their leadership.
The enemy and his knowledge must be attacked and destroyed by any means necessary in order for a-e culture to function.
And so scientology ultimately becomes an insulated cult playing out an exaggerated form of that which it is taught to condemn.
In practice this is how scientology culture operates.
Its form of governance is closed-system, thought-controlling totalitarianism.
That reform can include years-long confinement in re-educating concentration camps.
It more often entails the loss – or threatened loss – of communication and communion with one’s family and closest friends and even business associates.
And therein lies the most troubling aspect of scientology’s enforced information bubble.
It would seem that the road to recovery for a scientologist should include education in the very psychological mechanisms that were employed on him so effectively that they often continue to affect him long after he has left the cult.
There is a specific sector of scientology ‘technology’ that clearly betrays the subject’s hypnotic, mind controlling nature.
That is L.
Ron Hubbard’s ‘False Data Stripping’ technology.
The objective is to eradicate the earlier datum utterly so that only Hubbard’s datum remains unopposed.
It is based on the Socratic thesis-antithesis-synthesis philosophical equation.
C.
A great Greek philosopher.
A thesis is a statement or assertion.
Antithesis:  opposing statement or assertion.
However, had they looked further, they would have seen that other effects were brought into play.
It has very disastrous effects when it appears in the field of training.
The true datum comes back to smack up against the false datum he is hanging on to, as it is counter to it.
In other words, it is Ron’s way  to the exclusion of all other ways, including even your synthesis of his way with something related you may have learned earlier  or the highway.
This bulletin in fact was issued one month before Hubbard’s wife Mary Sue and eight other top ranking scientologists went on trial for crimes committed in running the largest domestic espionage ring in the history of the United States of America.
What ‘false data’ do you suppose all outposts of the scientology network were fixated on ‘stripping’ about that time?
The true scientology data is that if someone fails it is more likely that they are secretly engaged in criminal activity and have billions year old hidden evil intentions towards Ron and scientology, and that any failure should be interrogated intensively to uncover such.
Wrong.
It is quite evident from the theory section above where all this might lead.
So thorough is Hubbard’s ‘tech’ for ferreting out and disappearing ‘false data’ that conflicts with his data, ironically, that those steps applied to one’s scientology experience could actually de-hypnotize someone from years of mind control programming.
In other words, free him from the implant and give him the freedom to start out at square zero to discover for himself the plurality of ideas  thesis, antithesis, synthesis, or otherwise  available in a free society.

Scientology exists to provide help — help for all people — at    every strata of life, of every disability or ability and across all ethnic    and religious boundaries.
Borne out of this desire to help are the many social    betterment activities Scientology supports.
Scientology has been my road out.
There is nothing about my life I feel apathetic or unhappy about.
Scientology gives you hope and the certainty that you can improve any condition.
Before Scientology, my problems looked gigantic.
Worry, worry, worry.
The Purification Rundown was amazing!
I feel so much brighter and healthier now than I have ever felt in my whole life.
I feel as if there must have been some kind of inhibiting screen or shield around me, one that I didnâ€™t even recognize was there until it was lifted off of me.
It is truly amazing how much better I feel on an hourly basis.
I sleep better, think more clearly, and read with more understanding.
I feel as if my senses were out of whack before and have now been fine-tuned to receive and experience all.
My son died in an accident and in the weeks that followed I was constantly thinking about the moment when my father told me about his death.
During all my daily activities I appeared to be functioning properly, but that moment was constantly replaying in my thoughts.
I doubt I would have been able to continue to function much longer without it really driving me crazy.
After one session of introductory Dianetics auditing, six weeks after his death, that â€œtapeâ€� stopped playing constantly and I was able to proceed with my daily routine and obligations much more easily.
I do not believe I would have been okay without this auditing.
How Do I Learn About Scientology?
Scientology principles are best learned about by reading a book or listening to a lecture and then, putting them to use!
Get the answer to the question What is Scientology?
Mr.
Hubbard recorded his breakthroughs in Scientology and Dianetics books , essays and recorded lectures.
When you read a Scientology book, such as Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought , look at your own life and see if what you have read applies to it.
See if you can use the information.
Try it out.
Listen to recordings of lectures by L.
Ron Hubbard dealing with Scientology or Dianetics principles.
How is the Church of Scientology organized?
Church of Scientology International  CSI , the mother church of the Scientology religion, is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.
CSI oversees the ecclesiastical activities of all Scientology Churches, organizations and groups world over and ensures that individual Churches receive guidance in their ministries.
CSI also provides the broad planning and direction needed to support the Churchâ€™s international growth.
What is its understanding of a Supreme Being and the spiritual aspects of life which transcend the temporal world?
Most definitely.
In Scientology, the concept of God is expressed as the Eighth Dynamicâ€”the urge toward existence as infinity.
This is also identified as the Supreme Being.
As the Eighth Dynamic, the Scientology concept of God rests at the very apex of universal survival.
Scientology Sunday service, offered at all Scientology churches is a unique, lively interactive experience, where you will gain practical knowledge of Scientology            principles you can apply to life immediately.
Scientology church staff are there to answer your questions, help you work out what Scientology service is best for you, and get you started on your way to greater self            confidence, happiness and awareness.
Why do so many people turn to Scientology for answers?
Because Scientology technology contains answers that work.
Scientology helps people understand and improve their lives.
And life needs improvement in the complex and often hectic times of the 21st century.
A recent study of Americans found that 40 % of those surveyed complained of intense work-related stress.
Stress can come in many different forms.
How can you hold down a decent job in a shaky economy?
What kind of stability can you be guaranteed?
How about your family - will your marriage last?
Will your kids end up mere statistics, addicted to drugs or victims of senseless violence in school?
The staff at Scientology churches understand that when someone is beset with worries like these, they will find it hard to appreciate the tremendous potential for increased spiritual awareness and freedom that is available through Scientology training and counseling.
These pressing problems have to be solved.
Fast!
What about anxiety?
How does Scientology view that?
Perhaps you have been told that anxiety is an illness - that there is something wrong with you if you feel that way.
That is just not true.
Really the only way is to find out for yourself.
In an article called Personal Integrity L.
WHAT IS TRUE FOR YOU is what you have observed yourself and when you lose that you have lost everything.
Personal integrity is knowing what you know.
What you know is what you know.
And to have the courage to know and say what you have observed.
And that is integrity.
L.
Ron Hubbardâ€™s Scientology research led him right into the problem of handling the effects of drugs when he discovered that drugs actually prevent spiritual gain.
In an essay on the subject, Mr.
A recent study of Americans found that 40 % of those surveyed complained of intense work-related stress.
The planet has hit a barrier which prevents any widespread social progress-drugs and other biochemical substances.
Many people are surprised to find out the extent they are still affected by past drug and alcohol consumption, and by living in a toxic environment.
Because Scientology deals with basic truths about life, when people study Scientology technology, they gain skill in living!
Imagine trying to drive a car without knowing anything about one.
What would happen if you tried to build a bridge without ever having studied engineering?
Well, is life so different?
Could it be that the reason so many of us are consumed with problems and difficulties in relationships, at work, within the family, is because we are missing vital information on what life is really all about and how it works?
Scientology training gives you real tools you can use to improve your life, and to really help the people who are most important to you.
But what if I have too much trouble studying to take a Scientology course?
How can Scientology training help me?
Mr.
Hubbard ran into this very problem when trying to train professional Scientology auditors, and this led him to researching the subject of study itself.
He discovered an actual technology of study, and this is taught at Scientology churches.
Why is the Scientology religion called an applied religious philosophy?
So what is next?
Come visit a Scientology church or Scientology mission and start on the greatest adventure there is - an adventure into yourself.
Years after leaving the Church of Scientology, Oscar-winning writer and director Paul Haggis is still as disturbed as ever about the way those who leave the church are treated.
During a conversation with HuffPost Live s Ricky Camilleri about his new film  Third Person,  Haggis discussed his break with Scientology , which was first explored at length in a 2011 New Yorker profile.
Haggis told HuffPost Live that the powers-that-be in the church want anyone who defects to do so quietly, and those who speak about it publicly face extreme bullying and intimidation from Scientology officials.
The director added that his personal interactions with former members has been emotionally troublesome.
It was chilling to see how scared they were about speaking out or leaving.
Just leaving.
Haggis said.

Thank you!
Scientology claims “millions” of members, however estimates by former staff put that number at under 20,000 internationally.
Scientology is shrinking, as more and more members leave, including prominent celebrities, former high-level executives, highly trained technical staff and influential field Scientologists.
Scientology has tried to mask this decline by purchasing and renovating large buildings in key cities, paying for this excess with an aggressive and constant fundraising push, hitting up their members again and again for large contributions.
Why are so many people leaving?
Because they are discovering that the true nature of Scientology is not what they thought it was.
Behind the glittering façade, Scientology is rotten at its core.
Accounts by former members and staff paint a picture of fraud, abuse, and human rights violations, all carefully hidden from the faithful.
There are now thousands of these insider accounts online, and dozens of books written by journalists and by ex-Scientologists, including my own account of life inside Scientology, Counterfeit Dreams: One Man’s Journey Into and Out of the World of Scientology.
I started this site in July 2009 as a resource for people who wanted to leave Scientology, and needed information, assistance, or just a friendly ear.
I wanted to provide a central place where people could find insider information about the Church of Scientology, where they could peek “behind the curtain” and see what was really going on, and where they could begin to understand the lies and mental manipulation that has been used to keep them from questioning the Church of Scientology.
Within the Church, secrecy is the order of the day and ordinary Scientologists are kept in the dark as to what their Church hierarchy is up to.
At the same time, I wanted to provide an atmosphere where former Scientologists could openly discuss their experience with others, without fear or censorship.
Scientologists in the Church are not allowed to have open discussions, exchange ideas and viewpoints.
While this blog is no longer active  as I no longer have the time to maintain it , the discussions are preserved here in the Blog Archive.
I have also published the key essays from this site as an e-book, Leaving Scientology: A Practical Guide to Escape and Recovery , which is intended to assist anyone leaving the Church.
This site will continue as a resource for those who are leaving Scientology.
I have tried to make it as easy as possible to find the information on this site.
There is a wealth of data here, and I invite you to explore it.
The page headings on the menu bar above give valuable information about leaving the Church, and you will find a listing of post categories to the right.
Search these categories to find subjects and discussions that may interest you.
And of course I will continue to speak out against the abuses of the Church at every opportunity.

This Web page was founded on June 30, 1995.
Welcome to the Introduction to Scientology World Wide Web page.
Designed to present a critical but open-minded viewpoint, this page is for the curious and the uninformed: those who have heard about Scientology  and who wish to seek additional information about Dianetics , its founder L.
Ron Hubbard, and the organization that was his brain child.
Perhaps you ve read about Scientology in one of the many fancy publications of the Church of Scientology, or perhaps you ve learned about the war between Scientology and the Internet in a magazine, newspaper, or Webzine.
You may be curious about Scientology because some of its members are famous celebrities, including John Travolta, Tom Cruise, Jenna Elfman, Isaac Hayes, and others.
Perhaps you read Usenet , and you heard about Scientology from your favorite newsgroup.
Whatever your reasons for coming here, rest assured that you have found what you are looking for.
The links provided on this Web page will provide you with all the information you ever wanted to know about Scientology and its war against the Internet.
Since the foundation of this Web site, I have occasionally received emails stating that I am biased against Scientology.
I make no claims regarding the neutrality of the statements and opinions presented here.
As with all Web sites, this is a reflection of my personal opinions only.
I believe that Scientology is such a volatile, controversial, and polarizing subject that it is impossible to remain unbiased after you have experienced its actions first-hand.
However, regardless of what I may think of Scientology, I have taken pains to make sure that the information presented here contains nothing but the truth.
It is my hope that after you read these pages, you will want to become active in the struggle between Scientology and the Internet.
You have the power to think for yourself.
Internet, both online and offline.
It started here on the newsgroup, and the newsgroup continues to be the source of many of the most startling revelations about Scientology, with new bulletins appearing almost every day.
In addition, this page includes links to the Frequently Asked Questions  FAQ  lists for the newsgroup.
Is someone in your family a Scientologist?
Are you?
What can you do?
The simple act of discussing Scientology here on the Net can lead to a lot of unwanted trouble, and this may scare some people away.
This is exactly what the Church of Scientology wants.
With this in mind, I have put Operation Wideawake into action.
Read it, and learn what you can do to help others and help yourself, and participate  safely  in the war between Scientology and the Internet.

UPDATE # 2: Yahoo News has received a statement from the Church of Scientology, refuting the ABC News and Village Voice reports.
The Church of Scientology statement is included at the bottom of this post.
UPDATE: The Village Voice has an extended interview with Valeska Paris, which you can read here .
For most people, an extended stay aboard a luxury cruise liner sounds like a dream vacation.
But Valeska Paris says she was held against her will aboard the Scientology cruise ship   Freewinds   for more than a decade.
During her stay on the vessel, she alleges, she was forced into hard labor and never allowed to leave the ship without an escort.
In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation s  ABC News  Lateline program , Paris claims that Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige sent her to the ship when she was 18 in order to prevent her family from pulling her out of the organization.
Paris was born into a Scientology family, but her mother quit the group after her husband committed suicide, blaming Scientology for coercing him out of a self-made personal fortune of more than a million dollars.
Instead of the promised two week stay, Paris found herself unable to leave the ship without an official Scientology escort and was often forced into hard labor on the lower levels of the ship for stretches as long as two full days.
It s hot, it s extremely loud, it s smelly, it s not nice.
So, why didn t Paris simply escape from the ship when it would take port?
The Freewinds has a relatively small sailing route, traveling throughout the Caribbean and occasionally docking at small islands.
I did not want to be there, I made it clear I did not want to be there and that was considered bad ethics, meaning it was considered not right,  she said.  They take your passport when you go on the ship and you re in the middle of an island.
The Church of Scientology calls Paris  claims false but declined ABC requests to make church officials available for interviews for the story.
The church, which has a well-known litigious history, threatened Lateline with legal action for taking part in an alleged breach of confidentiality between Paris and the church.
In a statement, the Church of Scientology said Ms Paris  claims were false.
She certainly wasn t  forced  to be there.
She was also never forced to perform labor in the engine room,  the statement said.  The Freewinds is a wonderful place, as even Valeska said on numerous occasions.
The Church of Scientology has released a statement to Yahoo!
News refuting what it says are false claims made in the Australian and Village Voice reports.
In its statement, the church claims that Guider was a volunteer crew member of the Freewinds and was never held against her will.
Valeska Guider was serving as a crew member aboard the Freewinds religious retreat as a volunteer, adult religious worker.
The Freewinds is a passenger vessel with hundreds of people aboard.
Ms.
Guider s staff positions as a waitress, course instructor and staff counselor regularly placed her in contact with many parishioners and staff.
She left the Freewinds hundreds of times to go shopping, for outings with her husband on islands such as St.
Kitts, Aruba, St.
Barts and Curaçao, as well as for numerous other reasons.
She participated in extended trips to the UK, US and Denmark for which she passed through Immigration and Customs when entering and exiting these countries.
Her claims are false.

Lisa clause or Lisa McPherson clause:  an adhesion clause to insulate one  party from all damages, including personal injury or death, from known and  unknown conduct of commission or omission of the party so released.
A new Scientology release form has surfaced that gives the cult the right to hold its members in isolation indefinitely, and absolves it of any responsibility for a member s injury or death as a result -- the  Lisa McPherson clause .
Scientology killed Lisa McPherson in Clearwater, Florida, on December 5, 1995.
She was held against her will for 17 days, denied medical care, and forcibly sedated.
When her guards tried to force her to undergo the Introspection Rundown and she refused, she was kept in an isolation lock-down until she died from severe dehydration.
Forensic entomologists later identified 110 cockroach feeding sites on her body, and three nationally prominent forensic pathologists opined that the manner of death was  homicide  .
D.
D.
In 1997, Lisa s estate filed a wrongful death suit against the Church of Scientology.
That trial has been postponed six times by Scientology s legal maneuvering, but is now expected to take place in 2004.
Before and after the wrongful death case was filed by Lisa s family, attorneys for Scientology insisted to state prosecutors -- and on national television -- that there was no religious service involved in Lisa s treatment; she was simply a guest at the Fort Harrison Hotel   Flag   enjoying  rest and relaxation.   Similar statements were made to the St.
Petersburg Times .
But after initially lying about it to police investigators, Flag Senior Case Supervisor Alain Kartuzinski later admitted that he had written a program for the Introspection Rundown for Lisa and placed it in its proper location in her confidential PC  preclear  folders  see below .
It can t be found.
JEANNETTE-MEYERS: Rest and relaxation sounds like a wonderful idea.
But the records say that two days into her stay she was spitting out food and vomiting, four days into her stay she was ashen faced and feverish, and then she became violent, striking the attendants, hallucinating, thinking that she s L.
Ron Hubbard, being too weak to stand, soiling herself, crying, babbling, breaking things.
At that point, isn t it clear that it s not working?
RINDER: What s not working?
The state of Florida brought criminal charges against the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization in 1998 for its treatment of Lisa McPherson.
The case was eventually dropped after a sudden and suspicious change of opinion by the medical examiner, Joan Wood, as to the cause of Lisa s death.
In the face of these charges, can we be sure that providing any of our religious services to the members of our faith will not result in prosecution because some zealot in a government agency disagrees with our beliefs?
Can any of us be sure that if one of our parishioners in the future needs an Introspection Rundown, it will not result in our Church being charged?
The answer is, of course, no.
Seen in historical context, the Introspection Rundown is the culmination of pseudo-psychiatric and pseudo-medical therapies that dates back to the founding of Dianetics and runs through Scientology up to the present day.
Nothing about the Introspection Rundown is religious.
In the summer of 2002, during an attempt to disqualify attorney Kennan G.
Dandar as counsel for the estate, Scientology again argued that it had the legal right to hold Lisa McPherson against her will and deny her access to medical care and contact with her friends and family, because she was a parishioner, and Lisa s treatment was a  religious practice .
Judge Susan Schaeffer was not convinced.
Now this new document has surfaced: a release form for the Introspection Rundown .
Parishioners seeking services at Flag -- the place Scientology advertises as the  Mecca of Technical Perfection  -- must sign a contract promising not to sue if they are harmed.
And they are not given a copy to take home with them.
A scanned copy of this new form is reproduced below; the HTML version is available here .
The Case Supervisor will determine the time period in which I will remain isolated, according to the beliefs and practices of the Scientology religion.
I further specifically acknowledge that the duration of any such isolation is uncertain, determined only by my spiritual condition, but that such duration will be completely at the discretion of the Case Supervisor.
I accept and assume all known and unknown risks of injury, loss, or damage resulting from my decision to participate in the Introspection Rundown and specifically absolve all persons and entities from all liabilities of any kind, without limitation, associated with my participation or their participation in my Introspection Rundown.
Tory Christman, who spent 30 years in Scientology before quitting in disgust, confirms that the first such waivers were instituted right after Lisa s death.
We were not wrong to hold Lisa against her will and deprive her of medical attention and leave her to die.
We were never wrong.
YOU!
Here: sign this.
Clearly, Scientology s private position is that their mistake wasn t in killing Lisa McPherson; it was in not having a signed release form saying it was okay to do so.
This contrasts with the proposal Scientology leader David Miscavige tried to negotiate with the Florida State Attorney , Bernie McCabe, under which Scientology would take steps to ensure that its members receive appropriate medical treatment in the future if McCabe dropped the criminal charges in the McPherson case.
McCabe s scathing rejection of this offer questioned why Scientology has not already taken these steps.
To make it perfectly clear: Scientology is not against professional medical care, provided that the care is not of a psychiatric nature.
In fact, its written policies mandate that a person seek medical care from licensed professionals.
But with this form, Scientology is saying it has the right to kidnap and hold a mentally disturbed member at any time, because, in the words of one ex-member,  If THEY say you re crazy, then you are, and you have already agreed that they can kidnap you and hold you against your will if they deem you to be crazy.  And although Scientology claims its treatment is purely spiritual, its staff have no qualms about dressing up in nurses uniforms   pic1 , pic2 , pic3   to lure the public into taking a  stress test  on the E-meter or purchasing copies of Dianetics.
The main use for this release form may be for bullying doctors into relinquishing custody of patients who have been taken in for psychiatric evaluation, and are perhaps facing involuntary committment, just as Scientology bullied the staff at Morton Plant Hospital where Lisa was taken and coerced them into releasing her into their custody, despite the report from paramedics of her bizarre behavior and request for assistance.
This release form may not be legally enforceable, because if it were, any mentally ill person could sign a similar contract and evade involuntary commitment under the Baker Act .
The State of Florida has an interest in preventing such contracts from being considered.
Even more chilling is the section at the bottom of the form where an adult or guardian can sign on behalf of a child.
Members of various Christian sects who prevented their children from receiving medical care on  religious  grounds have been prosecuted for child abuse.
A Scientologist who denied their child access to necessary mental health treatment should run a similar risk of prosecution.
Among the evidence obtained during discovery in the McPherson case is a collection of Lisa s PC  preclear  folders, which detailed her treatment at the hands of Scientology.
The church vehemently objected to producing these documents, but eventually was forced to disclose them, although many crucial folders are still missing.
Scientology claims it can t find them.
In order to frustrate similar discovery actions in the future, Scientology has issued another new release form , ostensibly concerned with preserving the confidentiality of parishioner files.
Scientology s position is that not only does it have a religious right to abuse its members, but it also has the right to withhold the written evidence of that abuse, even if the member has been killed as a direct result of Scientology s actions.
Thus, Scientology tries to perfect its ability to both commit and cover up future crimes.
Lisa McPherson was not the first Scientologist to suffer false imprisonment and isolation as a result of a mental breakdown.

Investigation of future instances of abuse may be frustrated by the victims having signed these release forms.
Scientology continues to make claims that it can cure mental illness.

Scientology has been forced to hand over Lisa McPherson s PC  preclear  folders and other records relating to her counseling and care.
Scientology really doesn t like that, although they have no qualms about using the material in these folders to attack or blackmail former members.
The release form below is designed to make it harder for an ex-member  or their estate  to obtain access to PC folders even if they are later attacked by and forced to sue the church -- or killed by the church, leaving their estate to sue.

Here are the answers.
And with exact Scientology techniques, you’ll discover them for yourself.
Because Scientology is the knowledge of you.
Could Scientology be the thing that turns Flint, Michigan, around?
The Flint, Michigan, City Council is contemplating embracing a new way to save the town: Scientology.
Scientology creator L.
Ron Hubbard.
A nonreligious moral code, it describes 21 different principles, including  Don t Be Promiscuous,   Be Temperate,  and the always-hard-to-remember  Do Not Murder.  Scientologist Monika Biddle introduced the council to the book during an Aug.
22 meeting, saying it could really curb the high rates of crime and poverty.
The Way to Happiness Foundation says it has distributed 100 million copies of the book all over the world.
The organization tries to get the book out into communities, and suggests that police officers hand them out to children and neighborhood watch groups.
Police Chief James Tolbert thinks it s worth a shot to at least try using the program.

The woman is Jenny Linson Devocht.
She is a close personal aide to David Miscavige – the self-proclaimed pope of scientology.
She is also an intimate friend of Miscavige.
Because of scientology’s bunker down response to public exposure of Miscavige’s creation of a culture of violence at the highest levels of scientology, including maintenance of concentration and torture prisons, people have been in mystery as to what scientology management has been up to for the past several years.
This video gives a partial answer.
It is remarkable in that Miscavige has spent millions of dollars to create a wall of perjury before Texas courts claiming that he, and the highest levels of scientology management, have no knowledge – and have not authorized – these same type of ambush, in-your-face tactics against me and my family that have been carried out for years now.
Wow, they are obviously trying to do the same thing Tommy Davis did to the the BBC reporter, John Sweeney.
Talk about incorrect estimation of Marty Rathbun.
Jenny Linson’s face showed who she is too, and the group she represents.
It didn’t come across as momentary, either, or mocked-up hatred.
Embarrassing, all right – for her.
What a joke!
They ALL look like crap especially Jenny who looks like she needs some sleep and they all look like they need a decent meal, weight loss is scary.

Good one, Vin.
LOL!
Alanzo,  I wondered if they are so disconnected from the real world that they might not know that?
None of them look very good, how many years have they been in the RPF?
Shouldn’t these very senior executives be in England right now for the massive IAS Event?
From a belief that you create reality with your postulates, it’s a short step to believing that if you insist something is a certain way then it Will Be That Way, regardless of appearances to the contrary.
Black is white and 2+2=5, provided your Tone 40 is good enough.
Jenny obviously needs Marty to “be nothing” and is insisting on that reality.
To the rest of the world of course, the mildest description of such behavior is that the person is “out of touch”.
Well maybe someone should have faxed them a telex describing the Internet as a vast network of tubes upon which their words and likenesses may be placed for the world to see.
This is the kind of abuse and face-ripping that is only to go on “back lines”.
Alanzo, as higher up execs they have maybe used the Internet programmed with a NANNY SOFTWARE.
They are ALL kept in the dark by Miscavige.
Do you think he shows up for morning muster to announce that he is trying to throw the Church under bus in Texas to safe his ass?
That he, through out PR, he creates a new enemy for the Church like every three minutes by now?
That FORBES accessed his investment portfolio and he is worth 50 million?
WE know about David Miscavige.
The Sea Org DOESN’T!
And we know why he is like so bent out of shape on Marty.
Marty is consorting with his own friends on his own terms.
That is his real crime.
Wow.
In a visual dictionary the rants of Jenny Linson Devocht could be used to illustrate hatred.
Amazing how her performance at the same time displays extreme fear, the desperation and the helpless intent to destroy being always a half inch a way to break down and cry.
This woman is in a living hell no doubt.
Marc Yager?
There is nothing left of him, comes across like a big bumbling bozo floating in a glee of insanity.
These people are as sick as one can get.
That is the top management of the CO$, so they have access to real stats and know how Scientology is dying.
Their reaction is beyond pathetic.
Tragedy comes with comedy when Jenny Linson Devocht goes several times out of her way to make sure you know you had no effect.
Marc Yager?
There is nothing left of him, comes across like a big bumbling bozo floating in a glee of insanity”.
I got that sort of impression too.
It made me wonder if there is something sympathetic and decent left in him  based on his CoS indoctrination, of course .
Or maybe he was playing the good cop, with Jenny being the bad cop.
But most likely, he was trying to elicit a response from Marty.
I remember seeing “Mr.
Yager” at ASHO 30-some years ago and being struck by his presence and ARC.
A few years later, when I was at Flag, the staff were being shown a preview video the upcoming event – and he happened to stutter.
Wow, the look of terror on his face afterwards told me right there that DM was a tyrant.
I already thought of him as a dictator, because I felt his beingness coming straight down the lines.
After watching it a second time, I think you can tell they are putting on an act of pretending they just happened to cross Marty’s path.
At one point, Mark Yager goes over and taps the arm of the guy with the camera, as if to say, “Come on, let’s go” – like the whole thing was spontaneous and not all planned out.
And Jenny Linson tries to make it seem like she keeps changing her mind about walking off and coming back to repeat herself – also done to make the it look unplanned.
This is probably why Yager comes across so unreal – he’s a bad actor!
And the other two are also overacting.
Scientologists — their own worst enemies.
It is so sad.
Marty, I hope that in some way this video may help you.
It shows the harassment from high ranking church members, it illustrates how you did not react, and it captures you several times politely asking them to move along — and shows them returning toward you despite your request.
Repeatedly the church has sought out and engaged you and your wife while you have not tracked down and harassed their members.
If this is your last blog entry, please know that I have sincerely and deeply appreciated everything you have shared, and that I wish the best for you and your family.
Cece says thank you too.
Where were the airport police when this verbal gang-assault took place?
It’s scary to know that insane people can just do this kind of BS in public without being stopped.
They really should have been arrested.
Honestly, there’s absolutely nothing to like here.
This bat shit crazy ambush is unconscionable and cannot possibly stand as any form of religious “expression” anywhere in this country.
Three zombies doing their best imitation of the living.
Clearly there is something you are doing that IS bothering them, that they care about terribly.
This is a rehash of the exact same routine they did on me in the doctor’s parking lot in Clearwater — with Yager instead of Guillaume.
The lines they spout remind me of the AC 360 program.
The only things they are ALLOWED to say are the party lines dictated to them by Miscavige.
In many ways it is sad to see just how pathetic these people are.
And how terrible they look.
And to know they went off and gave one another “high 5’s” for “confronting an SP and telling him to stop committing suppressive acts” is even sadder.
And in light of the pending lawsuit — this is insanity of the highest order.
There is no hint of basic intelligence.
Like no one is home.
Sad, very sad.
I can’t believe I ever got involved with it.
Explains so much.
That’s very similar to my gut feeling watching her too — that this is a human gutted of soul and freedom and peace, with just the implanted robotic routines blurting out from a broken vessel.
Where are the signs of peace that come with deep enlightenment?
The OT abilities to handle anything?
The capacity to talk with anyone on any subject?
The ability to as-is problems at a glance of truth?
As annoying as their implanted behaviors are, I truly feel sad for them.
Their selves and their self-determinism have been stripped.
Anyone has a right to their opinions, and they walked away when you said they should.
You have a right to be where you want and so do they.
Nice that you are traveling.
Mind to share the reasons of your travels?
What purpose could there be for  following a man around in an airport, tossing insults at him?
2nd graders would know better and not act that way.
These are supposed to be ‘executives’ in the Co$.
I don’t think you you would see a bunch of cardinals surrounding a former priest telling him that no one likes him.
It’s bizarre, infantile behavior.
Where is their self esteem?
If someone told me to follow another person around and call them names, that would be my last day at that job or in that organization.
I have every ‘right’ to do a lot of insane things, but I am sane enough to know my self worth.
Same reaction you’ll get when ex-Mormons, ex-Amish, ex-any religion,  ex-any other organizations meet with those still in.
They’re disappointed of each other.
If there is no violence as cutting off beards etc, the best is to accept other opinions and move on.
LA airport is a big place where all kinds of people run into each other.
It is a stronghold of Scientology, so you should expect Scientologists there all the time.
If you can’t see the outpoint, if you can justify this kind of stalking and verbal abuse, that means you are willing to have it happen to you.
As you are willing for others to do it to others.
Everything you contribute to becomes part of your own reckoning.
This is how we create our future.
Scientologists?
Who happen to walk around airports with a video camera?
And who yell at someone that “nobody gives a fu&@ about” them?
I have run into many people from my past that I know are no longer practicing the faith in which we were raised and never once did I tell the other person that they were ‘nothing’.
I also never videotaped any of them.
Scientology?
Do you agree that this is a proper use of the money for which you are constantly hounded?
It’s absolutely hilarious for them to tell Marty that no one cares he is gone……so why were they following him?
This is the ‘leadership’ of your church.
It’s absolutely embarrassing.
I know a large number of Mormons.
Perhaps in some areas they practice disconnection but I’ve never seen it myself.
I have witnessed two families where several of the children left the church  one when on to drugs  and the parents and other children continued to associate and love their brothers and children.
Compairing what I’ve witnessed in the Mormon church to what I’ve witnessed in the Co$ is not even vaguely appropriate.
Makes you look very much like a garden variety troll.
Thank you for that Les.
So true.
There is no comparing Scientology to other “religions”.
Most of the people in that place and some coming out, actually need to attend bible school.
The ten commandments are good social policy and all of our laws are built on them.
Yet you see the church and it’s flock willing to “bear false witness” through perjury.
In no way do they treat others as they themselves would want to be treated.
The fraud and embezzlement  is equivalent to stealing.
Honour thy father and thy mother is a total farce in Scientology.
If no thetan is ever the parent of another thetan, then no thetan is really Chairman of the Board either.
Thou shalt not kill.
Revised by the Fair game laws.
Thou shalt not steal .
The Church does covet your home if it has equity.
The Church does covet your wife if she is a prospect for a donation or a potential Sea Org recruit.
The Church will covet whatever you have that they can take for their own resources because as much as they hate this prison planet, all of the wogs and DB’s on it, they are dependent upon all of it to keep their lights on, a roof over their head and food in their stomachs.
They are totally dependent upon everything they condemn.
And the fact that they are required by ethics to NOT comply with the demands of civil law, which are based upon the ten commandments, makes it an anti religious group.
Anyone comparing the C of S with other religions is a willing volunteer in anti religious campaign.
These people missed bible class.
And a basic education in social studies.
What matters to you is actually a wide departure from acceptable social intercourse.
Especially for an organization with a restraining order on it.
Once again, refusing to comply with the demands of civil law.
You might want to refer to the chart of awareness characteristics on the grade chart.
CRIMINALITY is right there and that is where you are too, to be in the middle here justifying this social intercourse and violation of a restraining order due to DOMESTIC ABUSE and DOMESTIC TERRORISM.
If you didn’t agree with all of it you would not be here working here as volunteer to keep it going.
K.
People like you, and the three people in the airport, are not being turned into clears and OTs by the Church of Scientology.
You are being turned into CRIMINALS.
Konny, The chances of running into an ex-scientologist at LAX are way higher.
Scientologist’s don’t have the money to travel and there are just a handful left in LA – most of which are “under the radar” afraid to speak out.
Miss potty-mouth hasn’t changed a bit.
She was always like that when ever she would talk to me back in the 90s.
Anyone who’s met her will agree.
I don’t care if she get’s any sleep.
Clearly broken her habit of calling people names and making sure you hear it over and over and over.
She even walks back to repeat what she’s already said – in direct contradiction to what shes spewing.
Nobody Cares?
It’s obvious you do Jenny.
The boss isn’t going to want to sleep with her anymore if she doesn’t keep repeating insults like she was taught.
Mark needs to see a Dentist and get those teeth looked at.
I nearly lost all my teeth in the SO.
Was only sent to the dentist when I couldn’t handle the pain anymore.
Clove oil was my friend for years.
Can’t take Tylenol or anything for pain because “they’re drugs” and make you un-sessionable.
Meaning you cant get a meter check or sec-check if you’ve taken them.
Bloomberg was staff at ASI the last time we spoke.
We had a nice conversation about LRH’s book “Revolt in the Stars” and how it was “an incredible story”.
There were rumors among staff that it was going to be made into a feature film.
This story was released to Scientologists as OT3 years earlier.
LRH even planted a seed in RJ67 “The Wall of Fire” making most Scientologist believe that if you were to read the materials of OT3 without properly following the steps of OT3, you could get seriously injured or even die, just byreading the story.
Perfectly safe to read and easily found on the internet.
But not “incredible” as Bloomberg claimed.
Hahahahaha – apparently it IS possible to poke a bear to death.
Seriously, your statement of “move on” was right on.
I am sure it was not easy to find such people, but glad you had them to ‘move on’.
She is lying when she stated “nobody gives a f*** about you, nobody cares,” if this were the case, why do they stop and blurt such a tirade of nonsense?
If they would not care, they would have just walked on.
Marc Y looks unhealthy, worn out, haggard.
Is not the Exec we used to know, the one that had honest care.
Anyway.
The second video clip shows a beautiful wife, a lovely place, plus friends.
I consider myself your friend amongst many others.
I am glad you have your life, enjoy it.
Welcome to their brave new world.
This is it.
Jenny as she chases after you in an airport…… Wow, just wow….
The three, speak as if there is a tape recording playing in their heads – repeating the same phrases over and over.
They appear haggard, stressed, robotic, – a trio very near insanity.
One can only imagine how their puppet master, Miscavige, would behave if he was also there.
If the general public knew these three were the top management of an organization that professes with certainty it is going to build a civilization without war, insanity, et.
It is telling that the ludicrous attack on Marty has not changed since day one, oh so many years go.
What is that definition of insanity that we all know so well?
What I was waiting for was a healthy dose of “Ralphie” to ice the cake.
I think next time Marty should just tell all those harassing him who have  at least physically   escaped from the INT base that this is their chance.
They can actually leave and be free.
Say “Here is your chance, WALK AWAY, come with me.
Do not return to the sadistic, mind altering abuse of your captor Miscavige.
I’m sure the reason they were sent is a trio is because even a pair could not be trusted to be freely roaming LAX – a pair can team up.
A trio is harder for the trust to form quickly enough to break free.
Ronn S.
Thanks for the reminders Karen, I was starting to feel sad for them.
Jenny is just being a bitch, bla bla, bla bla, but man, Yager looks rough, a dieing kinda rough.
All he could seemingly do is shake his head and move back, probably when Marty looked at him funny.
This was not a chance encounter, and it does make you wonder what the hell DM is up to now.
SP hole zombies to track you down and yell at you in LAX.
They don’t even see the irony in what they are spewing.
You’re a whole hell of a lot of nothing for them to be so obsessed with your every single move.
Hate is a virtue in Scientology.
Pitiful, simply stark raving pitiful!
They look like the walking dead in some bad Sci Fi movie.
I actually felt sad for them.
It’s hard to believe people can descend to such depths….
These people are in charge of children.
They should not be in the positions they are in over others’ lives.
They should be in jail.
That is why, if the US government will not do anything about these people, we must.
Monique’s lawsuit, the Garcia’s lawsuit, the Narconon lawsuits, Laura DeCrescenzo’s law suit and a million others need to be brought against these people so that they are fully de-fanged and bankrupted, and are no longer in a position to harm anyone ever again.
You shared 75 videos back to back.
Some seem private.
Maybe re-upload just the one….
Mark C.
This type of hateful aggressive behavior imprints on a being.
And the “event” will play over and over in their minds … creating deep crevasses and a further claustrophobic myopic view of the world for them.
Contrary to their words – Marty has a big life.
A family.
Hundreds and hundreds of virtual friends and dozens upon dozens of true real friends, who love him, his wife and son.
At the end of this day … Marty flies home to his adoring family.
At the end of their day, they see Miscavige.
Not exactly an equal end of a day.
That really says it all.
You know how this would have gone down: DM screaming on a conference call in his typical Philly broken English about how everything is going wrong and on top of it all, “…you muther f**kers won’t do anything to getting ethics in.
How come I know Marty’s in Los Angeles right now and will be leaving tomorrow at 5:30 pm?
Why is it I know his every move but you don’t.
Cause I’m on post!
Because you make it my job and you make it mine.
You leave EVERYTHING up to me.
Even the Squirrel Busters were not that.
Those lobotomies couldn’t tie their own shoes, but they did it.
Their job: put on the pressure, same as you.
But you WON’T go down there and lift a finger to put in ethics.
BECAUSE YOU CAN’T BE BOTHERED.
Then Yager or Jenny would have spoken up  not Bloomberg  and said, “Yes Sir, no Sir, we can and we will do something about it right away.
DM: “NO YOU WON’T!
No.
Why?
You don’t get it.
Because you let HIM kick your ass, and then you can call the cops and it’s over.
You go to the dentist.
He goes to jail.
You push the buttons, that’s what you do.
Witnesses.
Pathetic.
You’re nothing.
You create no effect.
Nobody gives a fuck about you.
3 on 1.
Intimidate.
Committing suppressive acts full time!
Nobody notices you’re gone!
Nobody!
Wow.
Why don’t you do something with your life?
Then all three would have been, “Yes Sir.
Sir, that’s brilliant.
DM: “Yager, if you don’t get him to smack you — Bloomberg, you run the video.
DM: “No, everybody in the hole gets a free punch.
Transcripts of the meeting would have been printed within 30 minutes, with a 5-hour deadline for immediate compliance.
They drill and rehearse for 2 hours.
Bloomberg holds the camera — who carries a big video camera around these days?
Every phone has great video now.
But no, Brownberg just happens to have a large camera in his pocket so he could video… what?
The inside of LAX?
Funny, I knew him for years.
Never saw him carry a camera.
With their authorized statements memorized and rehearsed, they all go down, Yager does his best — he is a natural leerer you have to give him that.
They all laugh, why?
That was one of the very lines one of their coaches gave them while they were rehearsing.
And they probably commented on it.
So when Marty repeated the very same line, they laughed because it was funny in that context.
Talk about an embarrassment!
Marc and David are actually caught up in the embarrassment of being seen with her as she rants so rudely and publicly.
Notice that they distance themselves from her.
0 in my life  she brought her sunshine to PAC a few times , but I have seen the other two work with people in higher tones often.
Jenny Linson came to PAC on a few face ripping missions and I get the idea from what I have seen of her and heard from others is that this is just what is to be expected from her.
For her, this is “ethics presence”.
Kind of sort of “works” when you are still committed to the cause but after your out and have opened your eyes, it’s just pathetic to see someone still attempting to control people this way.
Marc and David are being condescending and not really saying very much, but I think if you look close enough you’ll actually see spittle from Jenny and also some rather noxious looking fumes directly surrounding her.
Notice that Marc and David are the first to blow the comm cycle like frightened yet hungry coyotes, but Jenny keeps coming back to hit at you like a rabid, yet toothless chihuahua.
There you have it folks.
Top leadership flagrantly ser facing all over someone in LAX.
Not even able to hold on to gains from the lower grades.
The evil intentions dramatized all over video.
Jenny Linson  has been in a bully valence bullying others since the day she stepped into uniform.
This is the real her.
Compare this to her presence on Anderson Cooper.
Oh, I do hope Anderson sees this.
Didn’t she sit right in front of him on national television and accuse Marty of being the aggressive one?
Here she is ambushing him at LAX!
Someone could make a great video of her different sides evidencing the other as a liar and a fraud by comparing her here to her act on Anderson Cooper.
But even there, she could not help but to ser fac on the host of the show in front of his millions of fans.
Like, she was not aware of conditions.
They were obviously ordered to ambush Marty but someone didn’t think with the fact that he would have a camera and use it.
R.
They think this is instrumental to saving the planet.
David Miscavige yet again, sending out another woman to confront his enemy.
Laughter!
As he sits at Int behind his body guards.
This video is going to recoil like a whip on him.
He is on such a motivator flow.
He has been setting himself up for a take down.
He left the door wide open in Texas.
He is very naive to make himself such a financial asset to the local economy.
Times are hard.
And he is a affluent spending man.
People in Texas are not wasteful.
David  got busted spying on Marty 24 7 and stalking.
He just can’t seem to pass an opportunity to catch him on video.
LAUGHTER!
Me thinks he is in England holding onto another kind of pole.
He is truly, star struck.
His Achilles heel is Tom Cruise.
Servants, slaves, soldiers, petty wars, yes men, and fine dining.
Real estate.
Big bucks and boy toys.
At the end of the day he personifies everything the planet promises and has to offer.
He is “woggiest wog” at the top of the heap.
Normal, healthy, sane individuals in the real world don’t communicate with each other like this.
Let alone someone who they believe ‘needs help’?
I literally have not heard people speak aloud so childishly and self-indulgently since I was in junior high.
This is the most mean-spirited, nasty, intolerant, religion I have ever encountered.
I am continually amazed at the unprofessional and unrefined manner in which church executives communicate.
After 18 months of Scientology watching, the absurdity is still shocking to me.
Is it me or does everyone in Scientology just need some love to wipe away some of the oozing, bitter, nastiness?
How is any of that hatred and bullying making the world a better place?
I feel genuinely sad for only a great unhappiness can manifest in such a terrible outburst as I have seen among scientologists.
Laughter!
Laughter!
David Miscavige spend MILLIONS to stalk Marty and film him, because he has had zero effect and nobody gives a fuck?
Nobody even notices”.
That is why she it out there with a team?
I think they were propped up with a suitcase to make it look accidental.
But you see these people, what the purpose is?
To RE STIMULATE.
That is their purpose.
Then she says, “Why don’t you stop committing suppressive acts”.
Laughter!
If you really want to understand the depths of Jenny’s purpose to re stimulate,  notice how she slips in the command “Why don’t you just end it”?
It’s hard to confront but that is exactly where she went.
Wow.
I missed the “just end it” line.
When you say “just end it,” that carries a harsher message even in plain English.
And in Scientology, it could mean “end cycle” — in other words, commit suicide.
I’ve already commented that this confrontation was violent communication.
With a command to “just end it” in there, wow.
They may claim their behavior is protected free speech and religious freedom.
I think it is bullying and harassment.
Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance.
The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time.
What we saw those spiritually enlightened “Clears” and “OTs” doing in Marty’s video would have resulted in expulsion from K-12, student conduct and then probably expulsion from a college or university, and is expressly criminal in states that have anti-bully laws.
I sincerely hope the video is useful for Marty and Monique in court.
Yeah, it’s at 1:00 on the video.
It a request for him to put an end to his life and start a new life.
She will “save this planet” if it means she has to get rid of every man woman and child on it.
This is the spooky part of the cult.
Nobody is a finished product.
That means there has never been a finished product form the Church.
According to David Miscavige.
Why would you want or need be part of a group that has no finished product?
That makes more SP’s than clears?
That creates enemies with the Internet now, at about one per every three minutes consdiering the size of the planet , or something close to  that would be my guess.
That is now in the business of selling status and identities, the most holy and valuable one featured in this video.
Well said, Oracle.
That says it all.
I was thinking that if Miscavige were smart in a sane way, he would have sent the trio to have their “meet cute” with Marty and they would have played nice — and taped it.
They would have acted surprised, maybe a little uncomfortable.
They might have said, “Hey, Marty.
This is awkward.
We know about all the legal stuff.
But listen, we miss you and wish you the best.
If you ever want to talk, give me a call.
You’ve still got my number, right?
If they had done something like that, they would have helped Scientology legally, instead of shooting five toes off each of their own feet.
The problem is they _can’t_ do what is logical, empathetic, stretegic, or sane.
They can’t do it because that would be against policy.
They must always attack and never defend.
And once someone is an SP, that person is fair game.
If you climbed into the Scientology sandbox and decided to play nice without sharp elbows with the SP kids, you would be an SP too.
Their handling techniques don’t work.
They have never produced a single proven Clear or OT  okay I guess for faith, but not for science , and they have arguably created more SPs than clears.
Good stats!
The problem is they _can’t_ do what is logical, empathetic, stretegic, or sane.
They can’t do it because that would be against policy.
They must always attack and never defend.
And once someone is an SP, that person is fair game.
You said it perfectly.
If you do not become vicious, you are labeled “reasonable”  and I was labeled that  .
Whew!
Here comes the RANT!
Who the hell has a purpose to be unreasonable?
NOT ME!
You see the three flying monkeys in the video?
THAT is unreasonable.
They wanted me to be like them to be “successful” in the Sea Org.
I did not want to be like that.
I may not be a great soldier, but I was fucking DANCER   ENTERTAINER before I went into that!
I never auditioned to be a soldier!
I grew up under an army colonial  turned politician part time, eating dinner at the Army and Navy Club in the Nation’s capital one summer.
How reasonable was it for those kids to be running around in military uniforms claiming to be a Church?
That was fucking INSANE!
As a public I was sold the “personal ethics and integrity course” and ordered to do it.
Why?
Because I had an affair with a married man.
I stole him from his “girlfriend”,  I admit that  as he was no longer part of his marriage.
But they were all mutually enmeshed in drug problems and not highly beneficial relationships.
Since he was a “VIP” in the music industry, I was pressured like all hell to bring him into Celebrity Center.
When I wouldn’t put pressure on him to come in, the whole thing was switched to an “ethics and possible PR flap”.
I was made to feel like a total DB!
He had been waylaid by a drug problem during all of this and he had cleaned up while we were together.
After I was forced to CHOOSE between him and the Church, and I ended it, he ended back up on drugs and almost died.
Everything I shared with the Church was used against me and or for the benefit of the Church.
I had NO history of interfering in a marriage, NONE.
But this became my “out 2d” history.
I had to write all of my O W’s on every dynamic as a practical.
That took me seven months on that practical.
On the seventh dynamic I wrote as overts, every time I had keyed someone in.
Wittingly or unwitting.
They were happy when I was a student writing up my overts about enturbulating others spiritually.
When I wouldn’t volunteer to do it, I was worthless!
If I didn’t have a purpose to be reasonable, why the hell would I be involved in Scientology?
This is what a mind fucking mind bending experience SOME PEOPLE can run on you when they are DENSE BLIND and STUPID.
And they think they are general Patton!
The three featured in this video?
These are the ones departed from reason.
They are the antipathy of everything Scientology.
They ser fac.
They restimulate.
They enturbulate.
They invalidate.
NO arc.
NO krc.
In the valence of DEMONS!
The “save the planet” malarky?
If you are to believe everything else Hubbard wrote, the planet is a piece of mest.
Are you really going to drive human beings insane and torture them over a piece of mest?
A parcel of real estate?
Are you really going to destroy people’s lives over a parcel of real estate?
Fuck with their minds?
Unmock them for some ball of dirt?
Seriously?
People say white people are not violent statistically.
Wars do not included in the body count.
I have to tell you, I saw more covert and spiritual violence in the Church of Scientology than I did in all the time I had to live, or grow up ghettos.
Far more.
By a long shot.
Jenny Linson’s diatribe reminded me of the lady extolling the virtues of Revelations at the start of this gem by Curtis Mayfield.
And, if there’s a hell below, we’re all gonna go – and Jenny Linson will be at the door, like Mephistopheles’s Walmart Greeter.
They brightened up when Marty told them to “move along”.
I think that gave them a moment of pleasure.
But really, it looks like Miscavige and his team are asking that Marty be their executioner.
That would feel weird to me if someone wanted me to be their executioner.
But Miscavige and team are going out of their way for this.
Jenny Linson does look totally different from how she looked on AC 360.
I didn’t even recognize her as the same person.
And what kind of church wants their top ministers saying “f**k” into a video camera?
Answer: A church in it’s dying days trying to die quicker.
I admired the way you handled this.
I admire the fact that you are leading your life the way you chose to.
Those people don’t have a clue what life is all about.
I am sorry you were so closely connected to Miscavology as shown in the video which is really gross and pathetic.
Marc Yager… you could have done better, you were a decent guy and you helped fuck up Scientology.
The orgs are empty.
Athens org was empty last Sunday when I visited with a friend.
Marty, keep it up.
No matter what you think of Scientology  and what we saw and probably what you have experienced as top management is NOT Scientology , just keep it up.
The way you handled those people was a real true theta action.
Just NOT ISING the ENTHETA.
They have been ridiculed in the eyes of any sane person.
This is insane and that’s what they are trying to do to you and anybody who dares to speak up as with the squirrel busters.
But it looks like we have an effect, hahaha.
Because you have been speaking up BIG TIME for the last 6 years or so.
For this I admire you and I want to thank you for what you have done for Scientology.
To keep the subject clean of suppression and in any case to be able to discuss it amongst us without guilt, suppression or censorship.
Marty and Mosey, you won long ago.
Love to you.
If there ever was a footbullet, this is it.
My god!
I guess Miscavige is running out of ammunition.
Time is on your side, Marty.
Helped by the stupidness of the Scientology ‘top’ management.
To any person unfamiliar with Scientology asking what it is, it would be sufficient to show him her this little video.
It tells all there is to know.
I hope you and your familiy keep it up.
There is light at the end of the tunnel.
My thoughts are with you.
Good point, Sara.
Miscavige now may have to explain how his top lieutenants are _not_ reflecting his views and orders — which would make him seem like an incompetent leader and liar  which he is, but anyway .
Or he admits that they are reflecting his actions or orders, and did not go rogue on him.
In which case he concedes a lot of what has been argued about him being a cruel and manipulative assaulter of the lives and bodies of others  which he is, but anyway .
The problem with Miscavige is Miscavige.
Wherever he goes, there he still is.
Look at the conduct of above video.
Are these not CULTISTS.
Stalking, ambushing hurling insults on federal property where Government cameras record it all, all in the middle of a trial in Texas on the very same behavior.
I forgot how staggering this was when I watched it — a couple of years ago.
Seeing Iz and Maryann who I knew fairly well was … well … heartbreaking.
Especially Izzie — you can SEE that he was taken aback and yet OF COURSE he cannot leave.
Too many familial secrets.
And ONCE AGAIN — Marty maintained 100% integrity and said zip, nada, that could or would hurt the Chaits.
Marty did not have an ounce of hate, aggression or condensation towards the 3 who ambushed him.
In fact, I would ALMOST venture to say … he had a deep all-knowing love of them — knowing that their suffering was VAST and on going.
One can only — as a take-away — recognize how important Marty’s work is, Karen’s work, Mike Rinder’s and some others BECAUSE bit by bit this deeply encrusted body of HATE is starting to crack.
It’s been a while since I last saw Dave Bloomberg but I’d never had known it was him – he looks so cadaverous now.
He was a tall, beefy guy when I knew him, years younger than me.
Now he looks like absolute crap.
The gleeful trio really failed on an epic level.
The world now knows what being part of the senior exec structure of $cientology does to you.
This is a footbullet of planet-buster status.
You did well in the face of that blithering insanity, Marty.
These are husks of the folk I knew, but they’re still capable of inflicting great hurt in their fanatical crusade.
Somehow… this is reminiscent of watching a guy’s ex walk up to him in public and make a scene about how he’s scum, means nothing to her any more, never did anyway, is a complete loser and that she’s so glad she’s moved on and is so much happier in her life now he’s no longer in it.
I wonder: is this the final product of scientology or sociopathic programming or both?
Either way, I do hope it’s useful in court.
I am also sorry you have had to put up with this for so long.
Scientology is such a toxic stigma that I feel this type of behaviour stains even the reputations of former members – please correct me if I’m wrong.
I look forward to your next posts.
On a more compassionate note – I doubt there is anyone here who would willingly trade places with trio.
I hope they escape David Miscavige’s thrall.
I will also add that to me, this video has an unreal quality.
They have done it in the past.
The security cameras of that airport would have to have that person “on camera”.
OSA could be established, it would obviously prove intent to harass  fair game  you and any plea that it was just an “accidental encounter” would fall apart and David Miscavige would be a good step closer to the witness stand.
I do hope but would imagine that the authorities of that airport will be more than willing to help out.
Well, there goes your proof as far as scientologists having a teenage mentality.
My 8 year old is more articulate.
Agree with others about the arrogance, or possibly just stupidity.
You’re in the middle of a legal case, inter alia, about harassment, so OF COURSE you decide it would be a great idea to, um, spread a bit more harassment.
This a demonstration of Hubbard’s concept of thetan  static = individuality = individual = unmoved mover = God .
It seems like the more individual one is, the more isolated and insane one gets.
To me the semitic God is a creation of the human mind.
There are other definitions of God too.
I know.
In your equation  static = individuality = individual = unmoved mover = god  it is not clear which ‘god’ you mean.
But as he is surrounded with angels and fortunate mortels you made it into heaven, he is not isolated.
So I thought you had another concept of ‘god’ in mind.
Which one?
Are you sure the word ‘god’ is in the right place here?
Am I right in thinking that this equation is in fact based on Hubbard’s philosophy?
Anyhow, imho the equation is faulty.
The ‘=’ does not apply.
It goes against basic logic.
An individual is not the same thing as ‘individuality’.
A static is not God.
We do not even know if a static exists, I mean ‘static’ as a noun that is.
If this is Hubbard’s way of reasoning, than it is faulty.
Anyhow, I did not want to start a lengthy discussion on the meaning of words.
It can also be used to explain why Hubbard thought of himself as the teacher of the historical Buddha and as Metteyya, the future Buddha.
Hubbard claimed that the Buddha exteriorized during his enlightenment which is false.
Here Hubbard is following your equation – from static to individuality to God.
Now Gods in Theravada are impermanent.
Hubbard had to get aroung that with the unmoved mover.
Hubbard missed also the entire concept of the mind in that he had it confused with the engarm and the computer analogy.
I found this quotation from the Vimana Vatthu 50:15 which hints at this error that Hubbard made.
Noticed two typos.
Now Gods in Theravada are impermanent.
Hubbard had to get around that with the unmoved mover.
Hubbard missed also the entire concept of the mind in that he had it confused with the engram and the computer analogy.
Human awareness is much more sophisticated awareness than that of light.
Light is very simple motion.
Whereas, human awareness is much more complex motion.
The evolution has been from simple motion toward more complex motion; or from simple awareness toward more complex awareness.
Human awareness is much more complex than the awareness of a protozoa.
Semitic religions assume very sophisticated awareness in the form of God, even before the beginning of evolution.
This is altered sequence.
It is the result of a human-centric fixation.
There is no such assumption and outpoint of altered sequence in Eastern philosophy.
She is also an intimate friend of Miscavige?
LOL!
Amazing to me how stupid these people are.
Marty you did an EXCELLENT job of handling the situation.
And what she kept repeating in her gross antagonistic tone was SO FALSE.
Although, I don’t always agree with you, you’ve done an AMAZING job over the last 5 years revealing the human rights violations of the church.
There are so many people that do care to know the insanity that has been hidden from us.
I thank you for all you have done.
What the hell are they thinking?
Are they thinking at all?
Kudos on staying cool as a cucumber in spite of being harrassed by three batshit crazy loons.
David Miscavige must be so proud of these people, some of the highest ranking “executives” in the Church of Scientology.
This is what happens when brainwashing techniques are applied to “religious” workers.
Very sad and very scary.
People need to wake up to what Scientology can actually do to a person.
I am personally with the idea that both Marty and FZers and me and the Church and others should move on freely with what they want.
If my friend chooses to believe that I’m SP and thus disconnect, fine.
Yes, you might want to throw bricks at me for saying it, but they are free to chose their paths in life –even if that means that.
Marty’s and the COS’s and and mine others dirty laundry -imaginary or not- is not my business nor anybody else’s.
This is a bullshit game pointing out wrongs in each other, not knowing this will never end like without casualties.
And as SCNists know, in SCN pointing out another’s overts -imaginary or not- means own overts.
I am personally no longer interested in the topic as I think if SCNists knew their tech could handle things, they would handle such situations in session.
Obviously, and as has been told to me, action is greater than sessions, and not-isness brings about the as-isness of problems.
And also create antagonist with evil SPs.
Maybe after Class 78 you will realize what service fac means.
I’m not patient enough to wait.
I’m on a different path.
Happy clearing the universe.
Not-isness brings about is-ness.
It could also alter it but not make it go away.
I hope you understand I was being ironic about ‘not-isness bringing about as-isness’.
I meant through fighting one not-isness, doesn’t as-is, and it doesn’t go away.
To reflect and coax somebody to see what he is doing -with his will- is one thing.
To hold him accountable for and seek to punish him, as in the case of showing his O Ws or alleged O Ws around and discredit him, is another.
That is war, not-isness of a person, and it doesn’t bring about any cognitions that I know.
If it doesn’t bring about cognitions to him, but it bring about cognitions to others that might be under his influence, then good –the greatest good.
I think in the case of the COS people, they don’t even get to read from others, though.
I don’t mean to allow others to step on you nor on your beloved ones.
But what is that criticism of that woman  I don’t even know her  about her sleeplessness etc.
So, she chose to be there and be sleepless.
It’s her problem or her joy.
And she doesn’t look bad, anyway.
Maybe she was put to do that etc So what now.
She says she is saving the world.
Pushing back at her, especially with derogatory remarks wont help her see any light.
That’s more wood in the fire or more disconnection.
I’ve done that too, alright, in my life.
But I don’t think it works out well.
It takes some positive affinity, letting the person be  granting beingness , to see some light, me thinks.
Even long years after I left the COS, I don’t appreciate how people raised hell to force me leave the COS.
Guys, it’s up to me to decide, chill.
And as for the court case and it’s implications, I don’t know what is right or wrong.
I’m sorry for what happened to Marty and his wife.
I hope it will no longer happen.
I understand the court case is to stop that.
I don’t have any desire for the COS to be punished either, nor do I think it’s members will do better because of it.
I was thoroughly pissed too, because of some past incidents, that there is no point to pound again.
Bottom line is, after I left, nothing happened to me, maybe because I’m not any famous figure or maybe because I don’t try to change what happened 2500 years ago, anymore.
The COS has been harsh to it’s critics, and critics constantly pound at the COS too and SCN in general.
But I think it should end at some point.
I really dislike those webpages about how bad a SCN critic is as much as I dislike anti-LRH pages, that aim to ridicule and discredit them.
If we are all to do that for whomever we think is wrong on the field of religion, business, politics, philosophy this and that, we will do nothing else.
I would let people drive themselves and make the right decisions themselves, while still caring, and not disconnecting, as much as possible.
Maybe it sounds a bit too utopic, maybe I wont make it all the way, but it’s what I want.
Anyway, I wish you all well.
What I would think is funny Vinaire is people preaching about ARC, responsibility, as-isness and all that stuff, having tech to handle suppression, third party and going ahead and doing the opposite.
I think it is also tragic, what they are bringing about onto themselves by that, so I don’t laugh.
It’s a sort of a warning sign to the world, to not give a penny.
Very kind, I think.
I’ve read Buddhists have their leader reincarnate lifetime after lifetime –the same spirit.
Who -by the way- goes around preaching tolerance and peace even towards those who fight them.
But Scientologists don’t believe in such crap.
They are realist$ and have up$tat leader$ who work their a$$es out for the good of mankind.
It reflects on the overall upstatness, that is only ruined by ‘nothings’ who make evil posts on the internet –aside from the psychs.
Maybe if you hadn’t locked him out, like you have locked out thousands of ‘SP’s and LRH too, he wouldn’t be committing full time suppressive acts.
But it has nothing to do with you.
Go on with studying PTS SP courses being uptone and attacking with a smile.
Go be told who to like and who to hate.
Don’t let your affinity be alloyed.
Those who want to find their way, can find it, me thinks.
No matter what that is.
Sorry for the preaching, I just wanted to end for this season.
I hope we will be talking about more constructive matters later on.
I don’t have any interest in a living-dead religion anymore.
And I don’t like to whine about the past either.
I don’t have any.
But those who want me to have can save all my messages in their folders and wave them around, because it honors them.
Hi Spyros!
Nice to see you!
And I admire you for stating your views without worrying about being politically correct.
You make some very good points.
Nice to see you too, Marildi.
Marildi I have been into Christianity, atheism, COS SCN, some New Age, FZ SCN, SPT  other than just SP  and who knows what I will be tomorrow, if I take any part at all.
And I have believed in and done regrettable things.
But I’m still the same person though using different mindsets from time to time, and so they are.
They are not their mindsets.
I know that you know.
Love what you say!
But I think you would also agree that these people, or anyone, can’t just be allowed to harass others.
Right?
There’s a time and a place for everything.
To coin a phrase.
Yes, I was indeed MIA with some problems.
But I also felt too overrun on SCN and the related matters.
I checked out some Buddhist stuff and some others and I’m after something that looks good.
And instead of seeing differences and separation I see much alignment, although not obvious.
I’m amazed that such good stuff exists :D I had a different picture of Buddhism because I didn’t agree much with some Lhama friend of mine.
But it seems it has a variety –many branches.
I was referring to that post by Geir about a world without insanity, war etc.
It’s been a while.
What have you been up to?
I checked out some Buddhist stuff and some others and I’m after something that looks good.
And instead of seeing differences and separation I see much alignment, although not obvious.
Awesome!
What are you that “looks good”?
If you don’t mind saying.
What have I been up to?
Still getting something out of the internet dialogues but am getting closer to the ‘EP’.
A couple of recent things I’ve been checking out are Eckhart Tolle’s great youtube videos  btw,he’s very Buddhist-like, IMO  and also the Modern Mystery School.
SCN is.
But obviously if you get a threat by an OT to make you go hide in your cave, that is not any recognition of causativeness -on a spiritual level- by that person over you –by itself over itself.
That’s why fighting seems absurd to me, in SCN, contradicting all that stuff.
And it is the same in other religions too wherein the absolute Cause -God- supposedly asked his disciples to make wars because he was too weak to take care of things himself.
It would be as simple -in most cases- to just sit on a table and nicely have a talk.
But that will require some honesty and kindness and all that wimpy stuff to work out.
They read in the beginning of every course, they are the source of their attacks should they occur.
But OK, they only answer to the boss about that, towards others they are too right because they work.
ROFL I’m sick of this service fac.
It’s horrible.
I work, thus shut up.
Spyros, I liked both of your posts above.
But OK, they only answer to the boss about that, towards others they are too right because they work.
ROFL I’m sick of this service fac.
It’s horrible.
Btw, I read that Spiritologie is not spelled SpiritologY, and that the original founder is no longer part of it.
What do you know about all this, and do you still “subscribe” to that teaching at all?
I hope you get my ironies, when I speak ironically, because it’s not always obvious and gross misunderstandings can occur.
I referred to something I’ve heard a few times that if someone is busy doing something he considers good, you have no business to disagree openly, because at least he does something good  while you don’t  So then he is right, you are wrong.
I watched some funny videos on youtube under the heading SpiritologY, but had nothing to do with SpiritologIE.
Yeah well I subscribe to the degree I subscribe to SCN.
Spiritologie is what I like the most in SCN while pointing out some common misconceptions about SCN that I don’t like.
So, great agreement between me and that book.
The author ended it though, as he found a basic principle of the book to not be entirely true.
I was having a discussion with an indie recently about it, and he seemed quite pissed about the matter.
Like “money” and “money” and stuff.
It must be because the indies that informed him about it, do it for free.
I personally never gave a penny to Spiritologie, as I don’t have many, and as the book was for free, and the process was for free too  solo .
And I must say I had some good EPs.
Now, the craziest part is I sent a just message to the COS that among other thing told them I will let them be and do what they do and do my own stuff too, from my side, and go on with my life and no hard feelings.
In other words, grant beingness.
And I meant it.
I’m through with this war from any side.
Although I think I always was a bit myself.
Spyros: “Spiritologie is what I like the most in SCN while pointing out some common misconceptions about SCN that I don’t like.
Can you elaborate a bit on the above?
Interesting message you sent to the CoS.
You do think for yourself!
Anyway, it’s hard to know the whole truth, but there has to be truth to a lot of the reported evils since there are quite a few first-hand witnesses.
Speaking of it being hard to know the truth, I’m going to follow Eckhart Tolle for a while, because his method seems to focus on direct perception – and at the same time, his wisdom is very practical.
Amazing how much what he says seems to overlap with scientology too, but with a different approach, and I’m guessing it overlaps with Spiritologie as well.
Spiritologie focused on the spiritual aspect and didn’t focus much on the mental stuff.
The past was considered non existent unless it was created in present by the individual.
Also, there is the concept in SCN of becoming better.
In SPT the spiritual being was the same all along and it’s potential free, and what changed was what it thought.
It was not trapped nor had any time track nor anything else, unless it created such things for itself.
My favorite in SPT was the stress in granting freedom to each other and not demanding obedience and allowing different viewpoints to exist.
And so, I wan’t pushed either, nor made guilty.
That would not be considered ‘ethical’ in SPT.
Actually, I was the only one who ever barked, that I know.
I don’t agree with the ‘many reports=right’.
It sounds democratic, but I’m more on the non-authoritarian side.
Probably the flaw in SPT was what the author of the book pointed out, and thus it ended.
That is to say, he pointed out that own universe thoughts can influence what the being experiences, and not wholly create what it experiences, like it was stated in the book.
Others chose to continue with SPT.
I chose to stop.
I don’t know details.
Direct perception sounds good.
Might be the best thing I know of, in spirituality.
The more direct, the better.
For long I have been in the middle pinching a little on one side and then in another side, and yeah.
I should grant their freedom, let them be, I think –to them and to the rest.
Also, direct perception and also communication is better than indirect, in this case too :P I don’t want to join all sides of a fight, I want to join none.
Thanks for the interesting explanations!
Also good to hear you aren’t a fighter.
But we knew that.
On the subject of thinking and thoughts, here’s another Eckhart Tolle video that I really like.
In this one, he basically describes the difference between LOOK and THINK on the Know-to-Mystery scale, and he makes it real as to why ‘Think’ is down low on the scale.
The meaning of ‘Look’ is also fleshed out really well.
Even though Tolle mainly talks about “NOT thinking,” it is obviously required in life a lot.
But he explains how thinking can be done in a way that enables you to use the mind to your benefit – rather than the ‘egoic mind’ being allowed to run you.
This also directly tie in with the ability to be creative.
I’m no fighter, but this accusation after misinterpretation I read online some times, about various topics, is kinda taunting.
I don’t want to be diplomatic and PR either.
I try to be honest.
So when if I think something is idiotic, how do I say it without insulting anyone, even if he indirectly insults me and my friends?
That’s been a problem to me.
It isn’t that I know ‘the truth’, it’s just that some things I have experienced too –quite differently than described.
I choose to let people think what they want, and see how that will work out.
In SCN there were classifications of thought.
Starting from consciously creative thought  postulate , conscious mock ups,considerations, down to analytical mind thinking and reactive mind thinking.
There was no implication in SPT to figure-figure.
Like in TRs and many forms of meditation, the objective was the opposite.
And there was no not-ising reality either.
There was the concept of creating and then being a victim of reality, such as when you throw bricks at somebody and then you whine about the reality that he fights back at you  not you in specific  and then you show your wounds around.
In asking people, you could include somebody who has also actually gotten into that thing.
Or else it is a single party kind of democracy –an antagonistic party might I add.
Spyros: “So when if I think something is idiotic, how do I say it without insulting anyone, even if he indirectly insults me and my friends?
That’s been a problem to me.
It isn’t that I know ‘the truth’, it’s just that some things I have experienced too – quite differently than described.
That’s just one of the many “teachings” that might be learned in these blog exchanges.
But here’s you video of the day.
Some people actually imply they are entitled to throw bricks and get none back.
Prob is I don’t believe in any ‘superior’ people –but really nobody, including myself.
OK, enough with the generalities.
Thanks for the video, by the way.
By the terms he used in that video it would seem he’s had something to do with SCN.
Spirituality speaking, I am very far from what I used to be, as I think my ideas were not true.
It is hard to explain.
Even if something is workable, it doesn’t mean it is true.
If you can erase a picture to EP, and then it is nice and you won, it doesn’t mean there has to be a reactive mind.
That would be a little Aristotelian logic.
And if dealing with circuits could bring about improvement of conditions, doesn’t mean that without addressing circuits you can’t do that.
I think no path is true, but hopefully it leads to some truth.
Spyros: “…And if dealing with circuits could bring about improvement of conditions, doesn’t mean that without addressing circuits you can’t do that.
Just like so many others have said – the map  or path  is not the territory itself.
Or, stated another famous way, focusing on “the finger pointing to the moon” isn’t ever going to get you to perceive the moon.
Words can never be more than pointers.
Yes, I was amazed that many of their “pointers” are essentially the same.
Apparently, others have thought there might be some connection too.
According to the Wiki article on Eckhart Tolle, he was influenced by many different people and teachings, including Buddhism.
However, the list of Tolle’s influences does not include L.
Ron Hubbard, Scientology, or Dianetics.
Likewise, in the Wiki article on Scientology, Hubbard is credited with being influenced at least in part by Buddhism, as well.
There were other crossovers between Tolle’s and Hubbard’s influences, not just Buddhism, so there should be no huge surprise that their teachings would have possible similarities.
However, from my cursory investigation, I do not find that Tolle was inspired by Hubbard.
Not that he wasn’t, but just that if he was I couldn’t find it from my short search.
Some critics characterize Tolle’s books as unoriginal or derivative.
Sara Nelson, the editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly, said Tolle’s writings have been successful due to surging public interest in books that tell you how to be happier, more peaceful and more successful.
Yes, I think if religions and other organized spiritual philosophies didn’t exist, people would still look for some related stuff.
I don’t know whether they would be more successful or not.
I think it is inherent to want to know some things.
I don’t see any reason for antagonism between such philosophies and religions to exist, unless there are intentions to use that tendency of people to know, in order to somehow manipulate them.
Like when somebody has a tendency to need to eat, and ‘you’ use that so that to make him clean your house, because you and your horde have taken over all the land and there is no land for him to grow his own food –well, at least in older times.
Now almost nobody grows his own food.
Thus, I want plurality of spiritual philosophies and such, to exist.
And that is why I say what I say about the relative only importance of concepts like the reactive mind etc not to make it sound ‘wrong’.
I don’t think many in SCN believe one can attain anything analogous to Clear -to not compulsively create facsimiles- by anything other than SCN, because they think only their route can do that.
And of course they’re certain you must have an auditor to manhandle you, or else you can’t do much.
And you generally you must follow a specific route, or else.
They don’t understand those rules pertain to that philosophy in specific, the way it is made to operate.
It is not wrong, it’s just how it is.
Nor do they know in older times -within SCN itself- there were numerous different ways to achieve similar results.
I have overrun this, but there were times that nobody did nothing with facsimiles nor circuits.
And that he changed that for the public, doesn’t make those ways less valid.
And other than SCN, I have encountered wonderful people and practices here and there  and some totally indifferent or even antipathetic to me, as well  that are not at all inferior.
And keep in mind I’m very picky.
Just to sit and feel good or just key out is not what I look for.
I can feel better with a chocolate bar, or by taking a walk or better just make myself feel better.
I don’t need a whole ritual.
So, I only intend to have the subject free.
To not have it as a mandatory compulsion nor to have it be inhibited.
So, I only intend to have the subject free.
I like that.
Liked your whole post, in fact.
Nothing I can add to it.
See you on the next thread, okay?
Either here or at Geir’s.
Yes, every nice thread needs an off-topic Marildi and Spyro chat!
I don’t know about the next thread s , but maybe again –no promises.
I’m open to comm, though.
The more past you share with them, the more old behavior patterns will want to come back in…” Etc.
I thought it might apply to what you wrote in the post above it.
Maybe even applies to many of the exchanges between former scientologists.
So when if I think something is idiotic, how do I say it without insulting anyone, even if he indirectly insults me and my friends?
That’s been a problem to me.
It isn’t that I know ‘the truth’, it’s just that some things I have experienced too –quite differently than described.
What I get from Eckhart Tolle is that if you can’t agree with someone, or you even disagree, but you do so with “consciousness” instead of the egoic mind, it will probably come out okay – maybe even bring the other into consciousness  PT  and then you can have a real communication with each other.
Like the example he gave of the guy with his critical parents, who then started getting sincerely interested in what he had to say – because his response to the egoic things they said was not egoic but “conscious”.
I think you know this and I meant it as an ack for you.
And yes, the two of us do get into off-topic chats.
But this time I didn’t think it was all that off topic, if you see what I mean.
I remembered this vid because it’s the story of another being whose name was Diablo and got changed to Spirit.
I know.
You reffer to a condition and ability far beyond the ‘posing and resolving’ problems that is what we have been doing here most of the time, if not all the time.
What is not directly perceived by static tends to persist, and also the other way around.
With static perception present, you just can’t play this game.
Thanx for the vid.
I was contemplating being devilish too, before.
Well, I admit it.
Still, I can change that.
I thought that video might have been an answer to what you had just written:“So when if I think something is idiotic, how do I say it without insulting anyone, even if he indirectly insults me and my friends?
That’s been a problem to me.
The thing I enjoyed about this overall thread is that it basically brought everyone together regardless of the usual differences.
That was lovely too.
You and I have been doing that for a while.
LOL.
I hear you and you’re not alone.
Well, if we stick with Eckhart Tolle’s path map finger-pointing-to-the-moon, you would speak  or not  from a viewpoint of consciousness mindfulness.
The way I would word it is, you speak from a point of Look TR-0  which might even take you to Know .
Actually, I think you answered the question in the other comment you posted last, where you wrote: “What is not directly perceived by static tends to persist, and also the other way around.
So by that, I guess you wouldn’t be playing any games.
Unless, of course, the little devil in you decided to.
Aside from his affairs with his wives and the other examples you give, what about when you discover that most everything a person said about himself is untrue.
So that it could be said that person is a liar.
Would you be inclined to believe anything that person says?
Would you not discard the ideas of an inveterate liar and con-man?
Hi.
You are referring to LRH.
I was thinking of references to LRH too, when I wrote it, but meant it in general.
If I indeed discovered all that, then yes, indeed, I would think of him as a liar and wouldn’t be interested to spend any time reading listening to him.
Leave alone to believe him.
If I discovered it while having what is called significant ‘wins’, ‘gains’, it would be confusing.
I think a dishonest man could appear to steal some ideas from others to, in order to resell hem, but in action it wouldn’t work out well.
If you are connected to reality you are not alone.
Dm is very concerned about something Marty is doing or about to do.
There are a few ongoing activities that could have precipitated this “casual” airport meeting, his wife’s ongoing case, his notice on his blog of soon to be released information or others I don’t know about.
This doesn’t seem to fit into the continued harassment for harassment’s sake of the past.
This has all the appearance of a desperation move on somebody’s part.
As a side note isn’t Allender embarrassed to know he is on the cover of Marty’s first book appearing as the buffoon for Scientology?
Lots of fodder for the court case s .
Thumbs up for keeping your cool Marty!
I saw a saying recently, “Some people can suck the nice right out of you”.
Really gave me a new view on what happens when people erupt.
I always thought if I had the chance to stand in front of Jenny Linson I would make it a moment of redemption for all of the people I watched her torture and humiliate.
She didn’t just get like this.
She was ALWAYS like this.
In this life anyway.
But seeing her in this video, so “gone”,  really quite insane and it really shows when she is in a public place, it is the same as seeing a rabid dog foaming at the mouth.
You just want to stand back and look away.
If someone told me right now I could save this planet, every man woman and child on it, if I would just be willing to inherit her karma, I’m afraid everyone would see what a real coward and let down I can be at certain times.
What rubbish that last sentence of your is.
She’s batshit crazy, and her karma is not to know it, but to be the object lesson of what happens when one falls under the spell of charismatic violence.
Hubris is a harsh master and it comes with a cost.
This woman is how old, going on 17, like a spurned, angry girl?
My mother likes it.
Thanks for taking the video and posting it, Mark.
Personally, I still feel that the more exposure these guys get, the better off they and their intended victims will be.
I think they are really pissed off at you, Mark.
I also think there is a real sadness behind the facade.
Just my opinion, of course, but I think they are pissed because you get to go home to a lovely wife and child and they have to face miscavige.
They are pissed because you can do whatever you like with your days and evenings and they are forced to continue pretending to be saving the planet, even though they must surely know they are just pretending.
They are pissed because you and Mike et al are exposing all their very dirty little secrets instead of just letting them get on with their pretended help.
They are pissed because they are forced to confront you like this, knowing full well they are lying through their teeth and your truth is staring right back at them, making them feel degraded.
They are terrified because they think they are facing another billion years of this degrading shit.
They are hurt because they actually look up to you and dearly wish you could somehow save them from their torture.
There was a little bit of spit and a few sleazy leers, but there really was zero actual intention behind any of their words.
Foggy, out of present time and disingenuous.
Spurred on by their fear of miscavige’s wrath, not by any real desire of their own to be there and utter their inane comments.
Then again, maybe Jenny really gets off on it.
She does.
This could be a video promotion for “Jenny the dominatrix” on an adult channel.
David fair gamed his own “loyal officers” by sending them out to do this.
They can’t even see it.
That is how much darker he is.
And this is karma in harmony with people’s special needs.
And the media frenzy is just beginning.
Ouch!
Oh Yes!
And these are top Scientologists of the Church that Clearwater should be working with!

You know Marty, I remember when you were one of the people harassing critics like Keith Henson, Arnie Lerma, and Grady Ward.
I’m glad you came to your senses and left Elron’s lousy little criminal nut cult.
I can’t help but notice that back in the day, this kind of shit was carried out by low-level minions.
I guess Davey is kind of short of followers these days, eh?
Take care, and congratulations on your escape.
I admired them for being beautiful, handsome, sharp and focused.
Jenny was nice enough to include me in a small party of Messengers that got to see Ferris Beuller’s Day Off in a special showing in Westwood when it released.
Her dad produced it.
Is he still alive?
Can’t remember her last name.
Sam’s dad was a rich guy with come sort of controversial 2d history.
Marc Yeager as CO had the coolest office ever…all electronically fitted with the greatest sound system ever.
He was kind to me, but tough.
I was a scared 15 year old shot up to CMOI with no friends or family.
In hindsight, he was in way over his head with responsibilities as a CO.
I remember Bloomberg as this gigantic being of HANDSOMENESS.
He was like a skyscraper to me.
He was tough but respected because I thought he was one of the best producers at ASI.
I cannot believe what I just saw.
They look sickly.
Maniacal.
Scared.
Grasping for things to say to be mean.
Silence was the right thing to do.
No one person or group has the answers to happiness.
No one has a perfect life.
But WHO CARES.
I find my own happiness in things that make me happy.
It’s not complicated.
Try being nice to one another.
It feels very peaceful at the end of the day when you drift off to sleep.
And, as always, we each get up in the morning and put our pants on just like everybody else.
We all could use more cowbell though!
Mark N.
Few things display spiritual and physical ability combined like American football.

Right on!
Those pro athletes are OT’s!
The complexity of thoughts and decisions that occur in milliseconds, followed by instant action, that is as good a definition of OT as any.
The youtube video already has 11,841 views in less than 12 hours?
Jenny Linson “used the camera” on Anderson Cooper to lie to millions of television viewers.
To degrade and humiliate others, to spread illusion, not truth.
To cover up domestic abuse and domestic terrorism.
This is her “decent life”.
Now the camera, dismayed with being used as a harmful and deceitful tool, coveys a higher truth.
You see how you can put the same tool in different hands , and have either illusion and abuse, or vital information and truth, conveyed by it’s use?
I always wondered what the great scientology international management were doing, and their intelligence level.
It’s quite unfortunate that the intelligence of this peeps have been reduced to following orders, command intention, without inspection, for real.
Those were the top management of scientology, what do think about that?
That was scientology?
What do you think about that?
I also understand hindsight is easy and being in the middle of this is not so easy to think with.
And I am by no means a know it all.
I certaintly hope you do not STFU and stop posting as that was the purpose of those three.
Maybe… But who doesn’t have a smart phone these days…?
How much do you want to bet someone else filmed this on their phone unbeknownst to Marty or or Dave’s LAX missionaries…?
I wouldn’t bet against it myself.
Scientologists… The “higher up” they are stupider they behave.
I think what made especially weird was that they were pretending it was just a chance encounter and putting on an act of nonchalance – which came across as idiotic, because they were bad actors overacting.
Nearly 400,000 views on YouTube in 2 days.
Can you say viral.
0:01 MY: Works great doesn’t it?
It makes you feel good.
You know you could…you can actually get your ethics in Marty.
0:09 JL: Stop committing suppressive acts, full time suppressive acts.
Just end it.
Go live a life.
Why don’t you get a life, man.
Just get a life.
You’ve had zero effect, none.
And nobody gives a fuck about you.
That’s the truth.
0:31 MY: Right.
We are doing so well.
So stinking well.
You are standing afraid.
0:34 JL: Nobody has even noticed you’re gone man.
0:39 JL: You’re nothing.
That’s the point.
You’re nothing.
0:42 MY: No comm cycle.
Is that what you want?
0:46 JL: Your TRs are brilliant.
Why don’t you just stop committing suppressive acts and live a real life.
We need a…What’s he doing in LA anyway?
What are you doing in LA?
Why are you here?
1:01 MY: What a pathetic individual.
All you are is your camera.
1:03 JL: Why don’t you just end it and start living a decent life and do something to help mankind.
Cause you guys do nothing to help mankind.
Between you  Mike it’s pathetic.
You guys are embarrassing and pathetic.
Pathetic.
It’s disgusting and it’s all over your face and you look terrible.
1:31 JL: Wow.
He’s such a loser.
It’s embarrassing.
Why don’t you do something with your life.
You’re an embarrassment.
An embarrassment to the fact that you were ever, ever connected to us.
You have zero facts.
1:45 Marty: Could you people move on please?
Did you get…… Wow.
Embarrassing, humiliating, disgusting.
An absolute embarrassment that you were ever connected.
You have no facts.
Nobody cares.
Nobody’s interested.
You’ve done nothing.
You have no… I mean some movement, it’s a God damned joke.
No one gives a crap.
OK?
2:21 Marty: Can you move on please.
2:21 JL: We’ve moved on.

She mumbles something about a flight.
LAUGHTER!
Marty’s YouTube channel.
Karen, thank you for the link.
I add this interesting tid bit?
19+ years experience on staff died 15 minutes after Jenny met me in the elevator on the way to brief Cal  Cole AOLA Captain .
It’s been renamed the masturbation mission I think :  I don’t know that that is true.
Also While Jenny was telling me to leave on June 14th, 1996 I was thinking she has such beautiful locks.
All else I got was my husband coming home with bad news every single day and he is such an asset and they treated him with care but the rest of his life?
There is only one Dynamic in the real world of Scientology.
The 256th Dynamic ~ The ‘I tried dynamic’.
The weird thing for me is how weak those Scientologists look.
Thin, pasty, dazed and distracted.
They’re not convincing at all.
The bald guy looks like he might start crying.
It’s pathetic.
Those are some of the top people?
Really?
No wonder their empire is falling apart at the seams.
Those people would never make it in the corporate world.
In 4 Hour 175 000 more views .
David Miscavige, Chairman of the Board, has been trying to throw the Church of Scientology under the bus since RTC got mingled up in a legal situation.
I’m sure none of the staff have been informed that he has been working to throw their Church under the bus.
He might have set these staff up , Church staff, unbeknownst to them, to strengthen his argument that the courts in Texas should be going after the Church of Scientology and not him.
That or, they probably know nothing of the retraining order and the legal flaps created by Miscavige in Texas.
He will settle out of court now, and be able to BLAME it on these three and this incident.
And how he paid up to cover “their asses” from all the suppressives.
Miscavige has MAJOR WITH HOLDS from  the Sea Org staff and the Church he is paid to PROTECT and SERVE.
That makes sense too.
Miscavige having the withholds and these three managers not knowing about Texas would partly explain why they act crazy.
They do act like they know nothing about Miscavige’s legal troubles.
I read somewhere, I forget exactly where, that a psychopath will intentionally create a problem purely so he she can then go and put a solution in place  as a “hero”  that is a self-serving solution.
What sad people… They are very lost.
I hope they find their way out as soon as possible.
Their lives are filled with far too much pain and chaos.
After watching this video I am no longer afraid of this organization.
Just look at these people.
If these people are the “end product” of lifetime involvement within this organization, who the hell would be attracted to such an organization?
These people can’t see three feet outside of themselves.
They were trying to push buttons that Marty may have had 10 years ago  that could potentially still be mildly restimulated due to being in that organization for so long .
Hey Jenny, you old shriveled up has-been, you’ve had less than “no effect”, you actually had reverse effect!
You caused some of us to see for the first time that you are a complete joke and absolutely nothing to fear!
I hope Monique uses this video in her lawsuit.
Laughter!
1.
Per the tech Marty’s only terminal is IJC so the idiots ambushing him are violating their own tech.
2.
I hope the video is accepted into evidence in Monique’s case.
I feel so sad for them.
I Only know Marc Yager.
He Used to be a smart guy.
What a shame.
1000 on you tube ….

I was very curious about why she was dragging that towel around.
Perhaps to cover her face instantly should she get slapped, so the other two could take her ’round the corner and pummel her some more before reporting an assault.
While David Miscavige is in England being catered to, consorting with “VIPs” and torturing staff with his presence, he has his most loyal officer out at LAX begging for an ass whipping to bail him out of a domestic terrorism legal flap.
A woman no less.
This is exactly who he is.
Every man woman and child on this planet and every Church too, will go under the bus before him.
Laughter!
I’ve never posted to your blog before, but I really enjoy reading it.
I’m from TX and most of my family lives in the hill country right near you, so I’ve been following your case for a few years now.
My parents were involved in a cult in the 70’s, but until you and Mike Rinder started speaking publicly about the Church of Scientology, I had no idea how dangerous it really is.
Personally, I think this ambush is some kind of set-up.
I think DM was hoping you’d take the bait and there’d be a big brouhaha at LAX, which just goes to show that DM is worried enough about the harassment lawsuit down in Texas to resort to some pretty desperate tactics.
I also agree that he’s throwing the CSI under the bus as well, in the hopes that it will take the heat off him.
It seems pretty clear at this point that the only survival he cares about is his own.
To all you women out there…would you be at an airport, either coming from or going to somewhere, without a purse?
Or maybe Jenny didn’t bring it because she’s been told that Marty has become a thief and she believes it?
Or maybe she didn’t want a purse in the way of defending herself in case she was successful in getting Marty to slap her?
Les, If I were at the airport carrying on like that.
This was the thing that made it so painful to be in the Sea Org.
For me.
It wasn’t hours or whatever.
It was people who thought they were god like symbols   products and they were blind as bats and mentally deficient about conditions or common sense, somehow thinking they were “chosen” to rule the world.
And they though they granted special license to abuse.
The pocket book?
She probably has a wallet tucked in her bra.
She has been called “Sir” for decades!
LAX.
I’ll tell you this blows so much charge for me.
And this I consider to be a real breakthrough.
R.
Church , you can talk and write about these but the translation , you just can’t seem to nail what you mean to say.
And here comes this 2+ minute video and there it is for all to SEE.
Everything you have been trying to say.
For years!
And POW!
NOW everybody gets it.
And, it is kept so hidden and under wraps in the church.
And they deny deny deny.
This piece of film is a masterpiece Marty.
You are TRULY in favor with the Gods.
The REAL tone that goes on inside between the Sea Org, it is right here.
It isn’t just X’s that get assaulted.
The staff get assaulted like this all time from this woman and their fellow staff.
That you actually managed to pull it out and lay it on the table,  translate it, this a nothing short of a miracle.
You wouldn’t put people like this in charge of a nail salon, and here they are at the top of the organization in charge of people’s LIVES.
THIS is what I have been trying to say!
Committing this sort of “mistake”  intentionally planned, though  it only denotes the desperation the so call leaders are going through.
To debase oneself to such an assault also indicates that those who appeared on the video have no life of their own; mostly they follow and do whatever told to.
But this time, as some others, was a big mistake.
Glad the media is revealing the actual state of affairs re the church.
It’s all you have to do.
The mounting media coverage back flash regards this post confirms the total lunacy and meltdown occurring within  this rapidly failing cult.
Miscavige is shown to the world to be an out of his mind  control freak and his minions are something akin to the casting of a Freddy Krueger horror movie sequel.
Goes to show that that which goes around comes around.
Mark C.
A former executive of the Church of Scientology said three members of the church’s top management ambushed him at Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday morning, and that he has video footage to prove it.
Priceless.
Yes, right on.
A very high valued Target cannot have random actions done on them without co-ordination and permission from the pinnacle.
Marty is off limits unless Miscavige approved.
A concerted attack on Marty is thought out, planned, drilled and rehearsed.
The one thing that cries out in neon red lights is their level of DELUSION.
Marty is no longer a Scientologist but they are speaking to him as he is still part of their group.
3 against one repeatedly feed negative energy and so on ~~ delusion they are seeking an SP hole result to someone who set himself free of all of that.
Marty is not at INT base under SO jurisdiction.
He does not have to answer why he is in Los Angeles !
What DELUSION.
Here’s how an actual spiritual leader might act at the airport.
Play that side by side with the Three Stooges who ambushed Marty.
They have no clue, and would not — could not — recognize a great soul if it bit them on the butt.
How small and trite — and malicious — Scientology have made them.
Ronn S.
And I thought the Squirrel Busters was the pinnacle of insanity.
I can hardly imagine what all the attorneys involved are thinking now.
Or what the OSA staff who have seen this airport video are thinking now.
Maybe some OSA staff will walk from scientology inc now.
The aims of scientology are to end what again?
Follow their god lrh or they will try to cut you down!
The two men look almost ghoulish.
Also, once you watch it a couple of times it is “obvious” they are carrying out orders.
I served in a Special Ops unit in the military back in my younger days, and the more I learn about Scientology, the more I think it’s a paramilitary group and not a church.
Actually it’s a paramilitary cult.
That’s what it is.
It uses military speak, military regalia rank, it has it’s own Staazi, it’s own Gulags and black prisons, and most importantly, it employs military mind control tactics!
That’s right.
NO ONE.
Ever since this video was posted on youtube over three days ago  yes three Loooong days ago  it has ONLY BEEN VIEWED 552,461 times!
That’s right, 552,461 times.
And every single one of them are card-carrying members of the ‘Dave is the Pope Fan Club’.
So there you go Marty.
I hate to be the one to bring you this bad news.
Somebody had to do it.
Jenny Linson has become an embarrassment .
I really really really really really want to hit that woman in the mouth with a crowbar﻿.
I would have used the bald guy as some kind of strap on, bent her over and fucked her with him.
But that’s just me﻿.
Context please.
Any religion that advocates its members treating another human being this way is one to be avoided.
Did you know that the German government refuses to recognize Scientology as a religion?
The organization has officially been labelled as an “abusive business masquerading as a religion”.
I gotta say, I knew these people might be pretty creepy from stories I’ve heard and things I’ve read, but seeing this video puts things in an entirely different light.
These guys are the creepiest mother fuckers I’ve ever seen in my life.
I would have laid that bitch out.
He has way more control than me.
Let ‘em sue.
Three of the most obnoxious people I have ever seen.
Do they actually get paid to be arseholes?
The poison in these peoples souls, you can see it in there eyes.
Just pure hatred from emotionally wrecked human beings.
Seriously, they’re like the poster children of why you shouldn’t get involved in Scientology.
Wow I honestly applaude your coolheadedness.
If I ever met one in real life I’d laugh at them and punch them in the mouth.
I would have punched that cunt in the face.
Twice.
Wow, what a bunch of psychopaths.
They sound like the voices inside a schizophrenic.
Why is it that every time Scientologists ambush someone, they start harassing the person like a group of howling eight year old teacher’s pets?
Wow these are typical cult tactics.
I thought Scientology was a more sophisticated cult than this.
Scientology is a joke and so are its members.
Obviously you did.
For a person that said “no cares” about 40 times, she kept going back like she really cared.
I just finished watching this documentary by BBC, and the scientology guy uses the same words to the journalist.
He keeps telling the journalist that the journalist is being suppresive, and he has to get a life.
I got really angry listening to her, then thought it was hilarious, and then got angry again.
This dude has nerves of steel.
I would have smacked her.
She just can’t shut up, can she?
This is what your IAS donations pay for!
That man is a creepy black magic entity.
His TREASON is monumental!
Wow, violently insane Scientology criminals.
Well if you ever wanted proof Scientology is fucking crazy, I’ll just keep this link to rub in the nose of anyone who says otherwise.
Problem is I don’t know anyone stupid enough to defend this fucked up cult.
Who sees and hears these people and are like “They seem awesome” Wow!
Scary to know people like that exist and can get people to follow them.
Holy  shit that women is insane .
The guy has a lot of restraint because it would have been left hand city on those three fucken clowns .
You can see all the things said about these nuts its totally true.
Tom cruise is part of this shit he’s a nut .
I think she’s some Scientology up extremely well.
Haha!
This is so creepy.
Scientologists are the pond scum that pollutes the earth – especially that piece of shit women.
I wish I could kick her in the mouth.
In school we used to call them bullies.
This is Scientology’s centerpiece.
Their modus operandi is bullying and contempt and far, far worse.
Disgusting behavior and aside from this, these three goons look like they aren’t doing too well physically or mentally.
They want to control, and when they lose this, this is the next step.
Scientology is a corrupt organization of insane sociopathic freaks, and this video clearly shows it….
This guy was smart to leave this religion  it appears he still has some wits about him …… These three vegetables need to have a muzzle put on them, so they can spew any more of this Scientology bullshit….
But injustice recoils on those who deal with it”.

Hubbard initially wanted to reduce confusion by providing stable data.
What happened to it?
I think that all “stable data” needs to be examined and corrected and simplified further.
How to simplify that?
1  The stable datum may help restrain confusion, but it does not as-is the confusion.
2  When confusion is as-ised there is no longer a need for stable datum.
3  The stable datum is a temporay measure until the confusion is fully handled.
So the child, after he grows up, does not need his teddy bear any more.
Suppressive Acts are defined as actions or omissions undertaken to knowingly suppress, reduce or impede Scientology or Scientologists.
Suppressive Acts are clearly those covert or overt acts knowingly calculated to reduce or destroy the influence or activities of Scientology or prevent case gains or continued Scientology success and activity on the part of a Scientologist.
As persons or groups that would do such a thing act out of self interest only to the detriment of all others, they cannot be granted the rights and beingness ordinarily accorded rational beings and so place themselves beyond any consideration for their feelings or well being.
Using Scientology  or perverted and alter-ised tech and calling it Scientology  harmfully so as to bring about disrepute to an org, group or Scientology itself.
Infiltrating a Scientology group or organization or staff to stir up discontent or protest at the instigation of hostile forces.
Pronouncing Scientologists guilty of the practice of standard Scientology.
Writing anti-Scientology letters to the press or giving anti-Scientology or anti-Scientologist evidence to the press.
Falsifying records.
Acts calculated to misuse, invalidate or alter-is legally or in any other way the trademarks and service marks of Dianetics and Scientology.
Engaging in malicious rumor mongering to destroy the authority or repute of higher officers or the leading names of Scientology or to “safeguard” a position.
Severe breach of ecclesiastical and or fiduciary duty as an executive or corporate official of any Scientology or Dianetics organization which has resulted in severe harm, loss or disrepute for Scientology or the organization.
Calculated efforts to disrupt Church services or the flow of public up the Bridge through the Churches.
Blatant and willful obstruction of Church operations or interference with Church contractual and other obligations to the detriment of Church expansion or activities.
There is no policy in Scientology that requires Church members to disconnect from anyone, let alone family and friends who simply have different beliefs.
To the contrary, the moral code of Scientology mandates that Scientologists respect the religious beliefs of others.
Marty.
Honestly, Did you see the look on Mark Yeagar’s face?
To me, he didn’t look like a rabid dog against you.
He seemed like the kid who is hanging out with the bullies and has to say something or get bullied himself.
What I saw in his face was an urge to really talk to you so that you could help him get the hell out.
I’m placing my bets now that he’s the next “int base” rabbit who rabbits…if he can work up the nerve.
Also, I find it highly ironic, yet patently obvious, that David Miscavige would choose fearful and whimpy Yeager as the head of the so-called, “Watchdog Committee”.
Yes, if you want to get away with crimes, just put the whimpiest, lowest IQ people in HCO so you can get away with murder, organizationally.
In Miscavige’s case, literally  allegedly .
PS: Have you sent this to Anderson Cooper yet?
It will make a very interesting “before and after” article on Ms.
DeVocht, won’t it?
Pathetic?
Apparently it was the “hot button” for you, Marty.
Wide miss.
However, pathetic does aptly describe the effort that she and her little posse put forth to accomplish whatever they were trying to accomplish.
And, after watching your footage twice, I still can’t figure out what that purpose was.
In any event it certainly wasn’t very “ecclesiastical”.
These “international PR experts” have progressed from foot bullets to suicide head shots.
First, I am so sorry that you had to go through another of these encounters; following your blog, you have had more shit from these people than anyone should get in a lifetime but you are dangerous to them, so there… dogs will bark when cornered.
Second, Jenny looks like she has been repeatedly beaten up — definitely not aging well.
Third, Marc Yeager, in the video, does look like quite reluctant about doing all of this.
I do not know him personally, of course, but I get he is otherwise quite of a gentle nature when not sicced on people.
Fourth, last but definitely not least, is Jenny going to go down in history as the “Nobody gives a fuck about you” lady?
What a bright future she has ahead.
This is Brittany-Spears-level pop viewing stats.
And the comments clearly show that people are getting the message: Scientology is a vicious totalitarian brainwashing cult and something needs to be done about it.
Besides the week long Anderson Cooper series on “Scientology: A History of Violence”, this was probably one of the most effective events to inoculate the world against Scientology I have ever seen.
Sorry you had to go through that again, Marty, but my god man – well done.
I keep saying Marty is in favor with the Gods.
It is real social taboo to consider ones self as an “only one”.
And a very frightening thought for most people.
However, there is some potent magic in these moments.
Johnny Cash was the only one to make “Ring of Fire” a hit.
Marty was the only one to come out here and make BRIDGES and PLATFORMS for the “unholy” and write his books.
When your “only one” moment comes, if you don’t stand in it, there is no change for the future.
Only copies.
It takes monumental courage.
This was an “only one” moment.
Because nobody else on the planet was there, at that moment, who could have recorded this vital information and hidden truth, and translated it for the world to see.
People who stand in these “only one” moments and own them are always in favor with Gods.
The problem in the Scientology culture, is this chronic suppression of the “only ones”.
There can be only one”, only one.
First it was Hubbard, then it was Miscavige, although he is in fact, just a very poor copy.
This is exactly what has delivered Scientology upon the doorstep of mediocrity and ridicule.
And why i is slowly being eaten by time.
585 000+ hits and almost 1400 comments.
Just shows what interest there is in the crimes of the Miscavage organization.
Stop for a moment and think about what just happened here.
The Chief Executive Officer of a billion dollar corporation sent three of his top echelon juniors to one of the most public places in the world to accost and harass one of their ex-employees.
An ex-employee that was once their number two exec.
Someone who is instantly recognized by millions of people.
Someone who’s liable to attract a great deal of attention, should he be seen in a public confrontation with current employees of his former company.
If that wasn’t stupid enough, the CEO’s juniors engaged in these hostilities while the famous ex-employee filmed the whole thing.
Apparently, with no regard to the fact that this famous ex-employee would certainly publish the whole incident on the internet for all to see.
What CEO of a billion dollar corporation would be so stupid as to do such a thing?
What CEO wouldn’t realize that such an attack would immediately backfire and boomerang on the corporation and its officers?
Great insight Ronnie!
From the viewpoint of his position as an executive he has failed miserably as an executive.
Utterly and miserably.
The Church is not a solution, it has morphed into a present time problem upon society.
There is a reason her mother got involved in Scientology.
There is a reason Jenny got introduced to Scientology in the first place.
Unfortunately the Church has capitalized upon her issues and because of them, she rose right to the top to meet her mirror image.
This is how narcissists ultimately do themselves in.
They connect to their mirror image.
No doubt, Jenny has regarded the rest of her family with disdain through out her Sea Org history, for being wogs and other insignificant particles.
And has considered herself, “the only one that really matters” out of that family group.
But at the end of the day, the others have been well loved, respected, admired and applauded for their contributions .
For their caring friendships.
For their compassion and creativity.
While Jenny is showcased in her fame as a raving psychotic.
An actual public blemish upon a well respected and well loved family.
A shame.
Just like David, she has no idea what it is like to be there on the same terms as everyone else.
She has always had lots of cash and resources.
Her primary purpose has been domination.
David had his hands full with her.
With the media power her father and brother have, there was absolutely no way to let her go and have her turn against him.
Not with all of her knowledge.
Unless, of course, he set up her like this, to look like a raving, psychotic, which she is,  to excuse himself.
C.
Church of Scientology miscreatants….
I don’t know what other people’s goals are.
They have not all been told me and I do not like to dub in these things.
I am a pretty happy “not knower”.
My goal in all of this, has been to see everyone on the same page again out here.
I have always thought of people who have been attracted to exploring the super natural, as special people.
That has always made me like the people that got involved with this, no matter what side of the board they ended up on in this game.
I have always thought of them as being special, not gullible or stupid.
I am not a “group” person by nature.
Not really any asset to group movements.
When my “only one” moments come, I step into them.
If I am the “only one” to step forward  and imply another truth, I can be very annoying.
I did hope somehow to convey.
Church that I felt was unjustifiable.
This thread of sadism and waste, this lack of mercy and compassion, that was like a virus.
I have been helped very well by the tech and the auditors in Scientology.
I was also thrown out on the street at 14 years old because I said something negative about it.
And most of what I had to handle in auditing, was what I inherited by being an “unwitting” enemy and having to live on my own before I agreed to check it out.
Then I paid and paid.
But it gives me no pleasure to know my joy later on in Scientology, came at the expense of others.
It actually takes my joy away.
Because I know what that is like.
I was very careful in Scientology, to know that I did not make others hurt like I had been hurt, for disagreements.
I stepped over some other people’s toes out here, to protect others from fair gaming.
Especially other children, like I once was.
I know that grated on some peoples nerves.
C.
I was 14 for saying, “I asked the neighbor what Scientology was, and he said it was “a crutch”.
Everything I was beat up for in Scientology and the Sea Org, my track, was because of the way I had to live as a result of not understanding Scientology and being connected to a person who thought Scientology would define them.
I know what these translators are like and far south they can go.
I hoped for a day, when this small but hugely influence could be explained to others.
And Marty has managed to bring this full circle.
He has also managed to grant people beingness regardless of their views.
There is some bad stuff and good stuff in every thing around us.
Even your dogs have to be walked and you have to pick up after them.
We have a common experience that brings us so many opportunities for so many great conversations.
But, in the last four days my purposes for even being in this mix, have been carried forward by Marty.
To put us all on the same page, even for a minute.
To showcase this dark side of humanity that is a thread woven into this fabric called Scientology.
I have had a sleeping pattern of only a few hours a night for many years, and multi tasking on several projects.
I have been labeled all sorts of things from a “savant”  gets the most clicks on eval  to “hyper active”.
P.
14 for suggesting she “needed a crutch”, It has run the spectrum from “genius” at age six, to “drug case” in the Church.
Whatever.
Marty conveyed what I have been trying to say.
I no longer have to carry this with hold.
And everyone came together.
I have been sleeping.
I am calm.
We are all on the same page the last three days.
People understand what I have been trying to say the last three days.
He has carried me through a personal storm.
And helped me meet my very personal goals.
And I always knew he had this capability.
He has altered Scientology not with malice, but with compassion.
That is what some people do not get.
No strings attached.
So, seriously, I can rest in Peace.
But I will pay it forward.
Thank you Marty.
I think one of the things I like about auditing is that I just love to hear other people’s stories.
Thanks for all of your cutting loose and telling your tale, Oracle.
Scientology, as a subject, contains all of its own reasons to fight against itself by the very nature of its tenets.
Jenny is the embodiment of all that is wrong with scientology as an organization.
And who defines incapable?
She defines it as blindly obedient and willing to die for the organization, or be 100% with the organization’s goals as defined by a sadistic little tyrant.
Jeeze, what a crock of crap.
Scientology, as a brand, is TOXIC.
This is irreparable because the toxisity is woven into the fabric of it’s ethics, tech and admin policies.
It’s woven into the fabric of L Ron Hubbard’s imagined, glorious past and the accumlulation of his own missed withholds.
It’s part and parcel of the lack of honest evaluation of what does and doesn’t work.
It is laid in hard by the egocentric, “we are the only ones who can do anything about anything,” bullshit.
Scientology as a subject has no future because it continues to assert its false claims and glorify itself rather than stand back, sort itself out, assess with honesty what it can and can’t do and announce that fact publicly.
It simply cannot be honest, so it is being exposed.
And the true believers are very upset about that exposure because they think it hurts their stats.
And stats are everything.
And people are nothing, worse than nothing, unless they are a stat.
It’s quite a job to extract from the subject what actually does work to help a person get the release points which enable him to move on up a little higher.
Is it even worth it, in the long run, sorting out the fact from the fiction?
Personally, I’m not sure if it is, but for now I’m having fun with it.
I’m glad we can be friends then.
Here is something you may enjoy.
I found it to be a perfect antidote to Scientology’s OT insanity and a perfect wrap-up for its more enlightened views.
Well Les,  I was sent for a summer visit that turned into a very interesting life adventure.
No regrets, that’s for sure.
Thank you for all that you do to make the best of it work in a highly beneficial manner.
And thank you for your kindness and sanity.
Marty, I couldn’t help but think of that as Jenny Linson was saying you were “nothing”!
It has never ceased to amaze me how many suppressive acts are committed in the name of “religion” by these people.
I encountered plenty of that in the experience I had with my son being forced to disconnect from me as a minor child.
Suppressive and illegal!
THE FULL BLOWN SUPPRESSION AND CRIMINALITY IN THE NAME OF “RELIGION” NOW HAS ANOTHER VIDEO PROVING IT TO THE WORLD!
STALKING, NAME-CALLING, BULLYING, VIOLATION OF A RESTRAINING ORDER BY A COURT OF LAW, EXTREME INVALIDATION OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND HUMAN DIGNITY, AND THE INVALIDATION OF A PERSONAL CHOICE TO PRACTICE RELIGION IN ONE’S OWN WAY, MAKE THIS APPEAR TO BE A HATE CRIME!
Well Marty, now again we can all see what the long term exposure to Scientology’s indoctrination produces on its followers: religious mania and a state of overwhelm.
I took a backpacking trip in my late teens through some remote places south of the border.
In those days it was customary to seek lodging at Franciscan monasteries, some of them going back to colonial times.
Anyway, I had the opportunity to briefly observe monastic life, and to my surprise I found that some of the monks looked quite insane.

These horrendous images of humans being hideously tortured were what the fervent followers of Christianity were supposed to contemplate and be surrounded by on a daily basis.
Claire Headley recounted her valiant escape from the Int.
Base.
Interestingly Claire commented that she thought having done the OT levels made her more susceptible to Scientology’s control than Marc, her husband, as well as being raised and educated within the SO.
In essence, Claire stated that the upper levels actually worked against her ability to maintain self-determinism and that the longer you are exposed to this cult, the harder it is to get over its poisonous influence.
Hubbard expounded in his long essay on Black Dianetics, that PDH, was the principal means used by the “Old Man of the Mountain” to terrorize the Middle East  through his cult of assassins, who were supposedly turned into killer automatons doing his biddings.
As usual Hubbard threw a red herring on brainwashing.
As it turns out, extreme measures such as PDH are not actually needed to effectively achieve mind control and obtain obedience from subjects.
Rather clever and less overtly violent means have been historically used to control populations, one of the main one being Religion, including Hassan-i—Sabbah’s cult, as the assassins were trained both in the art of combat and in the study of religion and they viewed their Founder as a Prophet and Magician.
The many facets and subtleties of mind control has been researched over the last century, they are brilliantly exposed by Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow”.
Some cultures provide frequent reminders of respect, others constantly remind their members of God, and some societies prime obedience by large images of the Dear Leader.
Can there be any doubt that the ubiquitous portraits of the national leader in dictatorial societies not only convey the feeling that “big brother is watching”, but also lead to an actual reduction in spontaneous thought and independent action?
Best wishes and prompt recovery from Scientology.
Your video proves the unchanged Scientology officials mindset status quo is still the creepy brainwashed motif.
Miscavige would be a basket case nutball were someone to capture Miscavige’s daily communication style  on video.

France s highest court on Wednesday upheld several convictions for  organized fraud  against the Church of Scientology.
A representative from the Church told The Local the ruling was tantamount to  religious persecution  by France.
The Cour de Cassation in Paris, France s highest appeals court, on Wednesday rejected an appeal by the Church of Scientology against several convictions for  organized fraud .
The Church had argued in a September 4th hearing that the verdicts constituted a violation of their religious liberty, but the court on Wednesday rejected that claim.
In 2009, convictions and fines of €400,000 and €200,000  $812,000 in total  were handed down to the Church’s Celebrity Centre and a Scientology bookshop in the French capital.
Scientology leader in Paris, Alain Rosenburg and the Celebrity Centre s former president Sabine Jacquart were also found guilty of taking financial advantage of elderly members of the Church and sentenced to two-year suspended prison sentences as well as being handed €30,000 fines for organized fraud.
French scientologist minister Eric Roux on Wednesday told The Local the ruling was an example of France s  religious persecution  of the Church.
France is really the most backwards country in Europe in terms of religious tolerance,  he said.  We re being judged for our beliefs, not our behaviour.
The charges resulted from accusations by Parisians that they had been pressured into handing over large sums of money to buy materials in the book shop and Celebrity Centre.
The Church’s unsuccessful appeal to the Cour de Cassation came a year after it failed to convince a lower court of appeal to overturn the original verdicts and sentences.
The Celebrity Centre had earlier rejected the charges as “totally false and inequitable”, according to French daily Direct Matin, complaining the trial had “numerous irregularities and in which the fundamental rights of scientologists were violated”.
That s how I know this is about our religious beliefs and not about a criminal case.
The Church will now take the case to the European Court of Human Rights, Roux added.
Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides a right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
The scientologist minister called for Europe-wide uniformity of laws regarding religious freedoms.
This isn’t the first time the Church of Scientology has been touched by scandal in France.
In 1996, Jean-Jacques Mazier, leader of the Lyon branch of the Church, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for fraud and involuntary homicide after Church member Patrice Vic committed suicide after going into debt to pay for Scientology auditing sessions.
In 2008 Kaja Bordevich Ballo, a Norwegian student living in Nice, killed herself after receiving the results of a negative Scientology personality test.
However, prosecutors failed to find a direct link between the test and the woman’s suicide.
While the Church is considered as a religion in the US where it was founded in 1954 by science-fiction author Ron Hubbard, it is classed as a “sect” in France, following a parliamentary report in 1995.
It s kind when the French translate menus and signs into English for the benefit of us Anglos, but the result is sometimes horribly wrong or inappropriate.
Here are photos of the ten worst French translations.

Former French football star and new coach of Real Madrid Castilla Zinedine Zidane reacts during the Spanish League B football match Real Madrid Castilla vs Atletico de Madrid in August.
It s no joke.
Clown panic is spreading across France.
This story first appeared in the Aug.
9 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
In 2009, Paul Haggis, the screenwriter-director who won an Oscar for 2005’s Crash and wrote Million Dollar Baby, publicly broke with the Church of Scientology.
He had been a member for 35â€¯years.
While high-ranking officers in Scientology have defected from the controversial organization, Haggis at the time was by far the most famous to disavow it.
In early July, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed the news that actress Leah Remini, a second-generation Scientologist, had left the church after she allegedly was punished for questioning the conduct of its leader, David Miscavige, and for being critical of other Scientologists.
On July 27, the former King of Queens star, who has not publicly discussed her departure, told People, “We stand united, my family and I, and I think that says a lot about who we are and what we’re about.
I believe that people should be able to question things.
I believe that people should value family and friendships and hold those things sacrosanct.
Asked for comment, a Scientologist spokesperson said, “Regarding ‘Who Is …,’ the church has never hidden the fact it supplied information for the websites.
But] let’s be clear: We have had nothing to do with any website about her and have no idea who registered the site.
I didn’t say anything at the time for a number of reasons.
I am in Europe and have been working here for the last year and a half, and, disregarding a few friendly e-mails and a couple of tweets, Leah and I haven’t spoken in quite a while.
What I knew about Leah is that she was one of two Scientologists who had refused to “disconnect” from me and certainly the only high-profile one when I decided to quit the organization in August 2009.
I also thought any comment would be premature and self-serving.
Leah and I were always friendly but never close friends.
Despite this, she called me as soon as she heard about my letter of resignation.
Unlike the rest of my former friends, she expressed real sadness that I was leaving and concern for me and my family.
A few months later, we ran into each other at a school fair.
I kept my distance for fear of putting her in an awkward position, but Leah had no such fear.
She walked up, asked me why I was being weird and told me she would always be my friend and would never “disconnect” from me.
Then she dragged me over and introduced me to her family.
Soon after that, I moved to New York, and our paths just didn’t cross, but I was deeply touched by her gesture and genuine concern.
So all I could have said at the time was that, whether it was true Leah had resigned, she had always been a class act and a lovely human being -- but that wasn’t news.
In the last few days, I read some things that really disturbed me.
First was the way Leah was being attacked by her celebrity “friends,” who were disparaging her character.
Editor’s note: After actress Kirstie Alley tweeted “the sweetest poison is often served with a smile,” it was widely interpreted as referring to Remini.
Having witnessed Scientology’s smear tactics, I can imagine how this was being orchestrated, but I was still shocked to see how quickly those friends -- some of whom had known Leah for 20 or 30 years -- jumped on the “malign Leah” campaign, and with such apparent glee.
I assumed Scientology’s next step would be to try and plant disparaging stories about her with less-informed journalists and bloggers.
And if others who have made noisy exits from the church are to be believed, Scientology would also use their Office of Special Affairs employees to attack Leah indirectly, posting negative comments about her shows and career and abilities under myriad false names, pretending to be disappointed fans or whatever.
None of that is new.
What was new to me was the report that Leah had run afoul of the church by challenging Scientology’s leader, David Miscavige, who is held to be infallible.
When I was leaving and was visited by waves of angry friends and a phalange of top Scientology executives, trying to convince me to tear up my letter and resign quietly, I made a similar mistake by insisting they look into the charges of abuse detailed by the Tampa Bay Times.
I was working on a film about Martin Luther King Jr.
King were human and fallible.
I ended the meeting at that point, thanking them for coming.
According to what I read on Tony Ortega’s blog, at the 2006 wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Leah asked questions about her longtime friend Shelly, David Miscavige’s wife, who had suddenly disappeared.
Editor’s note: An attorney for Shelly Miscavige told Us Weekly in 2012: “She is not missing.
Any reports that she is missing are false.
Mrs.
Unlike her pious friends, Leah refused to accept the easy excuses that were offered.
The next thing I learned made me feel terrible.
Leah got in trouble because of me, because when I was “declared” a “Suppressive Person” and shunned, she came to my defense -- without me ever knowing it.
She had shouting matches with Tommy Davis, then the church spokesman, who had come to try and keep her quiet.
The fact that she fought within the system so resolutely for so long, never making her feelings public, is a testament to how much she believed in the basic goodness of her friends and the institution.
I can’t express how much I admire Leah.
Her parents, family and close friends were almost all Scientologists; the stakes for her were so much higher than for me.
Having been consumed with my movie, I only learned much of what I have written here in the last few days.
I also have to confess to not paying that much attention to news about Scientology.
In this case, I should have.
I finally called Leah during the last week of July.
Her answering service didn’t recognize my number, so it took a while to get through.
It was good to hear her voice and great to hear her laugh -- though it was easy to tell she had been terribly hurt and shaken by the events of the last weeks.
That said, Leah is an incredibly strong woman and will get through this with the help of her family and her true friends.
She is kind and generous and loyal; she has always cared more about others than herself.
She barely knew me, and yet she fought for me and my family, a battle she had to know in her gut she was never going to win.
That takes an enormous amount of integrity and compassion.
I will leave it to you to decide if the same can be said of Scientology’s executives and Leah’s many former friends -- especially those Scientologists who are watching her be smeared now and are choosing to stay silent.
I will forever be grateful to her.

We screwed up.
It shouldn’t have taken a wave of constructive criticism — but it has — to alert us that we’ve made a mistake, possibly several mistakes.
We now realize that as we explored new forms of digital advertising, we failed to update the policies that must govern the decisions we make along the way.
It’s safe to say that we are thinking a lot more about these policies after running this ad than we did beforehand.
In the meantime, we have decided to withdraw the ad until we figure all of this out.
We remain committed to and enthusiastic about innovation in digital advertising, but acknowledge—sheepishly—that that we got ahead of ourselves.
We are sorry, and we’re working very hard to put things right.
Later comments were more skeptical.
Read more later comments here .
Atlantic spokesperson Natalie Raabe tells The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple, “ Our marketing team was monitoring some of the comments ,” which has triggered the need to review that process.
The sponsored page carried a Scientology banner ad across the top and linked to two stories on the Scientology website.
This sponsored content is highlighted with a yellow bar.
Not all sponsored content on The Atlantic website carries that yellow flag .
Sponsored content — or “native advertising” — is produced by the news organization to look and feel like the site’s own editorial work; it has becoming increasingly appealing to several news organizations, including The Atlantic and BuzzFeed .
Sternberg reports that the “Native Solutions” program, started three years ago and supported by a 15-person creative team, “now accounts for half of digital ad revenue” at the Atlantic.
In an interview published today, Economist managing editor Paul Rossi tells Sternberg, “The opportunity for media companies is to create content that’s compelling for users on behalf of advertisers.
The real issue is how do you make content that’s compelling to a reader that doesn’t feel like an ad .
What standards are applied to the process of accepting sponsors?
How are those standards similar to or different than any applied to the organization’s other advertising or sponsorship activities?
What is the process for creating sponsored content?
How is that process similar to or different than the editorial process for creating other content?
What, if any, safeguards are or should be in place to anticipate situations like this one in which the editorial content and sponsored content may conflict?
How is the process for commenting on sponsored content similar to or different than the process for commenting on other content?
And what is the process for removing sponsored content?
Did this content violate particular standards, and if so, which standards?
How transparent is a news organization obligated to be with readers about the way sponsored content is handled?
Given the potential for confusion, does a news organization have special responsibilities beyond its standards for explaining other publishing?
Disclosure: The Poynter-owned Tampa Bay Times has published multiple investigations of Scientology, which has headquarters in nearby Clearwater, Fla.
If you think Phyllis`s story is impossible,, 3 weaks-ago my aunties neighbour basically broght in $4796 sitting there an eleven hour week from their apartment and there neighbor’s mother`s neighbour done this for 6 months and earned more than $4796 part time on-line.
Is there something wrong with my eyes, or did Atlantic change all their layout and typography after the fact?
Putting this up against Atlantic editorial content reveals the same tipoffs print publications use to alert readers to paid comment: the yellow “sponsored content” flag, the blue, sans serif headline  the editorial content is black, serif  the weird spindly body copy.
The airy layout.
The fact that there are no legitimate stories promo-ed around it.
I think anyone who has ever read a newspaper would spot this for what it is in an instant.
As for the question of what is arguably the best magazine in the English-speaking world accepting this load from such a suspect advertiser … that’s another story altogether.
Louanne, I think you mean “whoops, Julie, I overlooked your attribution before my little hissy fit.
Presenting first party propaganda as second party opinion is fraud.
Any* attempt to hide that action is contributing to the fraud and thus all attempts to spin advertising as editorial content, whether it is non-obvious or unknown site names, similar layouts, similar colors, obscured tiny notices or suppressing second third party comment without notice is contributing to the fraud.
There is no gray area or digital “innovation” no matter how much advertisers and marketers wish there was.
That fraud is important otherwise advertisers would not be willing to pay as much as they do for it  remember, they get that money from the people they are defrauding  and people who do it should be punished.
Most of the “ethical challenges” mentioned in the above article are easily resolved when you understand this.
Yes, they made several mistakes in this regard.
However none of that has anything to do with ‘free speech’ which is a natural right that it is the job of governments to insure.

Re same IP, same bldg, S center in Vcouver.
The propaganda dept at LRH’s place is in full op.
Funny, for a sci fi storyteller to have created such a weird tragic cult in his later years, maybe will have to wait for passing of Miscarriage until the cult dies off of its own accord.
I’ve seen videos of Hubbard giving speeches in 1950s to followers, and believe you me, he KNEW and was AWARE, self-aware, that he was pulling everyone’s leg.
IMHO: if this advertiser in this story had been Hitler’s Nazi Party in 1933 or 1939 or 1941, would the Atlantic have let the advert stand?
Ask yourself this question.
Not to compare the Scientology cult with the cult of Hitler, but there are similariries in terms of propaganda, the big lie, and disappearing former members , no?
Shame on Atlantic for putting the Almight Dollar above publishing ethics.
This advert went beyond the pale, and there will be hell to pay for the Atlantic brand for quite some time to come.
What was Jay Lauf smoking that day?

RE:  raincoaster said — ”When I got comment-bombed with pro-Scientology comments, I did a little investigation and they were all made from the same IP, which traced to a building in downtown Vancouver with the same address as the Scientology center.
I’d be very curious to look at those Atlantic comment IPs.
And thank YOU, Julie.
Independent examination and analysis is much appreciated.

Do you think the Atlantic will be reporting THAT story?
Free speech?
That is the reason why Anonymous is so far up Corporate Scientology’s butt right now because of their unwillingness to ALLOW free speech.
It’s only allowable if it endorses the cult?
And if it speaks against the cult then those should be “Fair Gamed”?
John Sweeney about that one.
That was the dumbest thing I’ve ever read by you Louanne.
You should know better than that.
Hi, Dee.
Thanks very much.
We are working on a follow-up piece that expands on this analysis.
I’ll add a link here once it’s published.
Great job, Ms.
Moos, in articulating the ethical questions surrounding this type of advertising and comment moderation.
I’d enjoy an expanded commentary on those issues.
I spent time last night, as this was happening, pondering many of the issues you’ve raised and am sure they are what the Atlantic is struggling with at the moment.
B.
Broeker: “Such beautiful buildings!
It’s a gem of snark.
The moderators must have been unaware that Mrs.
Miscavige has mysteriously disappeared and was last seen in about 2007.
People tend to  conveniently  forget that “free speech” means the government cannot limit speech under the law.
I really don’t have an issue with them running sponsored content  even from organizations I don’t like .
My issues is that they either should have the comments closed, or they should run comments in the same manner as they do on a regular story.
Hi Julie, thank you for responding so fast!
All good.
I am not trying to be neutral.
But I am trying to be fair.
Where is Shelly Miscavige’s right to free speech?
I have only your best interests at heart, Louanne, when I say: Run towards the light.
Save yourself!
Tick Tock.
I promise not to say I told you so.
John P.
Julie, you should note that Louanne is one of the most prolific Scientology shills on the Internet, by the way.
It’s believed that she’s not an employee of the cult, but a dedicated member who does this virtually full time.
She is hardly a neutral party.
Google “scientology louanne”  without the quotes  and see what happens.
Louanne, please note that the only free speech issue here is the censoring of the many negative comments that The Atlantic sat on.
I’m not sure you’d want to be crying “free speech” when correcting the only free speech issue in sight would inevitably result in publication of many comments that would reveal to The Atlantic’s audience numerous details of malfeasance, criminality, and appalling behavior by the cult you defend so vehemently.
An advertisement can hardly be seen as a “free speech” issue; it’s a business issue entirely.
The Atlantic can refund the cult’s money  or not  and that would be the end of it; litigation against the site for suppressing the cult’s right to “free speech” would end badly for Scientology, but at least the rest of the world would reap lots of laughs as you shoot yourselves in the foot yet again.
Hi, Louanne.
Thanks for posting the document.
It’s attributed to you in the post  right beneath it, with a link back to your Scribd account .
Is there somewhere else you think the attribution belongs as well?
If so, I’ll be happy to add it.
Thanks for the very thoughtful comment, John.
Poynter will certainly continue to cover this case and native advertising more generally as journalism tries to innovate its business models.
There are many unanswered questions worth exploring.
Oh, and a BIG BOOO!
The Atlantic for damaging free speech.
John P.
1.
While I  and presumably most of The Atlantic’s readership  know perfectly well that these are synonyms, it still looks like the use of the more “polite” term is trying to gull the unwary.
This was the only indication that the story was an advertorial.
2.
Use of a layout that is identical to news stories in type face, layout, etc.
Typically, print magazines running advertorials require a different layout, specifically requiring a different type face.
The Scientology advertorial was absolutely identical to the standard story layout.
Even if you caught the “Sponsored Content” tag at the top as I did, seeing the identical layout still felt sleazy.
3.
Censoring of comments, which was easy enough to determine was occurring.
To those of us who are activists against this evil organization, we certainly recognized the prose style of the pro-cult shills.
But the tip-off that anyone could have spotted was that, after about 25 comments were up, the comment system recorded a smattering of “like” votes for each of the pro-cult comments, but in almost all cases, well over 100 “thumbs down” votes.
It’s inconceivable that a controversial article would have only positive comments, each of which had a crushing volume of negative votes, but that none of the hundreds of people voting against the comments would take the time to write a negative comment themselves.
The brand damage that The Atlantic has administered to themselves in this ill-considered adventure is probably going to be considerable  and permanent  unless they come up with a comprehensive and visionary solution to the problem of advertorial sleaze.
I hope Poynter will study this further as a case study in furthering its mission.

Each one has his own reasons.
If editors and publishers continue to debase themselves and their brands, readers might come to depend on the quality of arguments and evidence.
St.
For decades, L.
Ron Hubbard’s controversial Church of Scientology was protected by a veil of mystery sustained equally by the church’s secretive practices and its reputation for terrorizing critics and defectors through lawsuits, harassment, and psychological warfare.
That façade has begun to crumble over the years, as intermittent outbursts of bad publicity built into a hurricane of negative press that threatens the Church’s future.
Scientology received another devastating blow in February 2011, when The New Yorker published “ The Apostate ,” Lawrence Wright’s riveting exploration of how Oscar-winning filmmaker Paul Haggis defected from Scientology in 2009 over the church’s long history of institutionalized homophobia.
In Going Clear, Haggis emerges as a figure of fascinating contradictions, a writer whose films hyperventilate with raw emotion, but who is so cold and removed in his personal life that, in a particularly moving passage, one of Haggis’ two lesbian daughters says she didn’t realize her father loved her until he began speaking out against the church’s treatment of gays.
Haggis prides himself on being socially and politically engaged, yet for decades, he willfully blinded himself to Scientology’s civil-rights abuses, bullying, and history of contorting facts to suit its purposes.
Haggis stuck with Scientology throughout the decades because it worked for him.
He was attracted to Hubbard as a magnetic figure, a prolific pulp writer who used fiction to express his big ideas about the world, though Haggis didn’t have much respect for Hubbard’s prose.
Still, his system provided dreamers, artists, and spiritual seekers like Haggis many of the fundamentals of a healthy life: a sense of community, a valuable series of personal connections within his field, a sense of self, and a cosmology that made sense of an often scary, unknowable world while pointing the way to total happiness and complete self-actualization.
Scientology’s worldview was rooted in far-out conceits involving other galaxies and evil space tyrants, but what religion, respected or otherwise, doesn’t involve similarly counterintuitive, far-fetched ideas?
Wright’s admiration for Hubbard’s ingenuity, insight, and force of personality is evident throughout Going Clear, even as he systematically debunks seemingly every aspect of Hubbard’s personal mythology, from his war record to his academic qualifications.
Hubbard portrayed himself as a swashbuckling adventurer with the mind of a top scientist, a proto-Indiana Jones whose life leaped from peak to peak.
Wright depicts him as a man plagued by misadventure more than adventure, suffering humiliating defeats and evasions as much as triumphs.
He depicts two Hubbards: One is the genius and prophet of Scientology lore, who figured out the mysteries of the ages via a peerless understanding of the human condition.
Then there’s Hubbard as seen by detractors: a con man and parasite who worked out a grift so elaborate, it outlived him.
Going Clear splits the difference between these two competing, overlapping narratives, depicting Hubbard as an eccentric genius who was brilliant but arrogant, a pathological liar blessed with a world-class imagination and the energy and will to create his own religion out of bits and pieces purloined from Buddhism, New Age, self-help guides, and the psychotherapy he considered one of the great evils in the universe, in no small part because it posed such a threat to Scientology.
Though he claimed he was sending acolytes on a bridge to superhuman abilities, Hubbard was a frail figure beset by physical infirmities who lived much of his life one step ahead of the law.
Where Hubbard ruled through charm, seduction, and canny manipulation, David Miscavige, his successor as the head of Scientology, rules through terror and brute force.
Miscavige comes off as a psychotic Dennis The Menace, a pint-sized bully with a history of physically attacking anyone who displeases him.
One of the book’s many tragic ironies is that the people who would benefit most from psychiatric treatment and medication, like the perpetually apoplectic, violent Miscavige, are also the least likely to seek it out .
The Church naturally denies Miscavige has ever hit anyone, along with pretty much everything else negative Wright reveals in the book.
Wright peppers the footnotes with so many Scientology denials, they almost become a deadpan running joke.
In Wright’s telling, Miscavige led Scientology into a new golden age of abuse, abduction, and intimidation, as both rank-and-file membership and upper-church management were subject to Miscavige’s whims; those who displeased him wound up in brutal work camps as part of the sect’s Rehabilitation Project Force.
His cruelty and immaturity are so over-the-top that they border on comic, littering Going Clear with pitch-black comedy moments that are too depressing to be funny.
Miscavige professionally and personally attached himself to Tom Cruise with such intensity that they quickly became strange doppelgängers, united in their cravings for power and influence.
The canny Miscavige realized he was in a position to give Cruise a form of validation far beyond anything the rest of the world had to offer.
Miscavige gave a man who has everything the opportunity to see himself as a savior and a leader of mankind, a figure of profound historical importance.
Celebrities understandably gravitated to a new faith that actively courted them while promising gifts beyond wealth and fame, but the church’s intense affiliation with famous figures proved problematic when those carefully cultivated celebrities began malfunctioning, from John Travolta’s passion project Battlefield Earth becoming an international laughing stock to Cruise transforming himself from one of Scientology’s greatest assets to one of its greatest liabilities with his controversial, eccentric behavior.
Scientology’s emphasis on celebrity acolytes makes it unusually vulnerable to celebrity defectors; the same power, prestige, and visibility that made Haggis a prize for Scientology also let him launch an attack on the church that falls somewhere between devastating and an outright death blow.
Sometimes Wright’s prosecutorial zeal gets the best of him.
He continues to obsess about the lush, decadent details of Cruise and Miscavige’s personal fortunes long after establishing the financial gulf between church bigwigs and non-celebrity members.
Wright lingers on brand names and luxury items so obsessively that at times, he threatens to turn into Bret Easton Ellis, lovingly cataloguing the brands of the Reagan era in American Psycho.
His case against Scientology is strong enough that he doesn’t have to keep piling on: The facts speak for themselves, particularly the endless accounts of ex-Scientologists who were emotionally and physically abused and run ragged by the church, then shunned and humiliated when they found the courage to leave.
Wright doesn’t need to keep twisting the knife.
Wright takes Scientology seriously as a new religion and as a philosophy.
In a bid for objectivity, he contextualizes some of the hostility and skepticism greeting Scientology as a result of the church’s newness: It lacks the authority and moral weight that comes with being passed down through centuries or millennia.
Wright points out that plenty of other now-accepted customs look surreal or even silly devoid of context, like Catholicism’s belief in transubstantiation, but he also makes it abundantly clear that a lot of that hostility and skepticism is richly justified by the organization’s actions.
In accessible, straightforward prose that does a fine job of rendering Scientology’s sometimes convoluted core concepts understandable, Wright captures its horrors and abuses, but also the seductive glamour.
It’s a belief system with a sense of infinite possibilities in this world and the next, wedded to a life-affirming sense of community among true believers united in fighting for our planet’s salvation.
In spite of its occasional excesses and redundancies, Going Clear is simultaneously a fearless, compelling, exhaustive work of muckraking journalism and a masterpiece of storytelling.
It’s a ripping yarn about ego, money, abuse, faith, and the corrupting nature of power when wielded by the wrong people.
It’s as lurid, pulpy, and preposterous-seeming as anything Hubbard or Haggis ever wrote, but it’s much better, because it has the benefit of being true.

SAN ANTONIO -- In a decisive legal victory for David Miscavige, the controversial leader of the Church of Scientology, the Third Court of Appeals in Austin ruled Thursday that he does not have to come to Texas to be deposed in a high profile civil suit pending in Comal County.
Miscavige is one of a half-dozen defendants in the suit filed by Monique Rathbun, wife of a church dissident, over an alleged three-year campaign of dirty tricks, harassment and surveillance that she claims was personally directed by the church leader.
The prospect of Miscavige, who is based in California, having to testify under oath had made the Texas case the focus of fevered attention of Scientology dissidents around the country and beyond.
A request Thursday afternoon for a comment on the ruling by a church spokesman was not immediately answered.
The church has consistently denied that Miscavige had any knowledge or involvment in the mistreatment of Rathbun, wife of Marty Rathbun, a high-ranking official who left the church a decade ago.
While acknowledging that the ruling is a significant setback, Rathbun s lawyer Ray Jeffrey said the case will continue.
The core of our lawsuit is that this was really a campaign directed by Miscavige against Ms.
In granting the Miscavige relief, the appellate court ruled that trial court judge Dib Waldrip in New Braunfels had  abused his discretion  by ordering the deposition.
In it s opinion, it concluded that the Rathbun s had failed to prove that Miscavige had signficant general connections to Texas or had been personally involved in the harassment campaign against them.
Something CAN be done about it!

Noting a tremendous downturn in the level of ethics and morality in society, and a consequent increase in drugs and crime, Mr.
Hubbard wrote, “If one does not like the crime, cruelty, injustice and violence of this society, he can do something about it.
Scientologists may be facing their most daunting court case yet, and all it took was for someone to stop calling them a cult.
After a years long legal battle, federal prosecutors in Belgium now believe their investigation is complete enough to charge the Church of Scientology and its leaders as a criminal organization on charges of extortion, fraud, privacy breaches, and the illegal practice of medicine.
The decision follows years of investigation that was triggered by a complaint by the Labour Mediation Service in the Brussels Region.
Labour mediators were unhappy with a number of labour contracts,  reads the report from Flanders News .  The matter ended up on the desk of examining magistrate Michel Claise, who ordered raids on Church of Scientology premises in 2008.
And  with the help of Google translate  Belgian newspapers De Tijd and L Echo are both reporting that the Belgian federal attorney is now seeking prosecution.
Which is a new twist, as most of the group s many court battles over the years have focused on establishing its legitimacy as a religion.
S.

One of the more similar recent cases against came in 2009, when the French chapter of Scientology was convicted of fraud by a Paris court and fined nearly $900,000.
Neither the federal prosecution nor the Church of Scientology have made public comments since word of the impending charges surfaced early Friday.

For thousands of years Man has searched for the true meaning of life.
In Scientology, that search has culminated—for the secret has now been discovered.
Here are the answers.
And with exact Scientology techniques, you’ll discover them for yourself.
Because Scientology is the knowledge of you.
You may not believe this, but you can write something that some group doesn t   approve of and then have a quarter of your life almost ruined.
I know because it   happened to me.
In 1968 I was a struggling New York   freelance writer, searching for an investigative story that would make a   difference.
I was already used to controversy -- and publicity -- when a year   earlier I had successfully stowed away on an ocean liner and  wrote an article    and sold movie rights  about it that had appeared all over the world.
But when I next decided to expose a then relatively unknown organization   called Scientology  and the related Dianetics     I ended up falsely arrested and facing 15 years in jail, had 19 lawsuits filed   against me all over the world by Scientology, was the almost victim of a near   murder, was the subject of 5 disgusting anonymous smear letters sent to my   family and neighbors about me, and endured constant and continual harassment for   almost 15 years.
In it, among other things, I stated that the crux of Scientology their   e-meter which they say acts like a lie detector produced questionable results;   that Hubbard had lied about his credentials; that Charles Manson had called   himself a Scientologist; that some auditors had behaved improperly toward their  parishioners ; that some who left may have feared being blackmailed; that some   defectors claimed that they had been psychologically damaged by Scientology,   financially ripped-off, and or harassed when they tried to leave or speak out.
I got used to telephone death threats, harassing calls -- and lawsuits.
I was followed, and people seemed to be trying to gain access to my apartment.
Then, in the basement of my small building, I discovered alligator clips on my     phone wires likely the remnants of a phone tap.
I quickly moved to a safer doorman building.
But soon afterwards, 300 of my   new neighbors received an anonymous smear letter about me, outrageously   describing me as a part-time prostitute with VD!
Little did I realize that they   would ultimately cost me $28,000  like $75,000 today  and they would   unsuccessfully sue me after the case was over for even more money!
Even worse, during the grand jury, the prosecutor, John D.
Gordon III, told   me that if this Grand Jury decided that I had sent Scientology the 2 bomb   threats, I faced 5 years in jail for each letter, 5 more for perjury for denying   it, and  $15,000 in fines.
But Gordon was unconvinced.
S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.
I could barely write, and my bills, especially legal ones,   kept mounting.
I couldn’t eat.
I couldn’t sleep.
I had been doing extremely well.
I had 4 books out and I wasn t yet   30.
But once these accusations came out at trial,  what editor would give an   assignment to a writer believed to have sent bomb threats to the people she   wrote about?
I had wanted to be a writer since I was 8 years old, and my dream   life was about to be over.
I was also very concerned about my parents.
They had adopted me from an   orphanage in Belgium when I was 6, and I had always tried to make them proud of   me.
I tried desperately to prevent a trial.
I also volunteered to take lie-detector tests to   prove my innocence.
But they returned contradictory and inconclusive results,   although not surprisingly, they did show me to be highly stressed.
Bob Straus, left me.
Most of my friends also stopped calling because I     was so obsessed with the  horrors that were happening that it was all I could     talk  or think  about.
On July 26th on my 30th birthday, I decided to end it.
Fortunately, an editor   friend at the New York Times stuck by me and called me.
She kept me on the phone   for hours to stop me from continuing to take the entire bottle of Valium I   admitted that I had started to take that evening.
He was sympathetic to what was going on and moved in with me late that   summer.
Since I was too depressed to go out much, he did my errands and walked   my dog Tiki while I compulsively watched the Watergate hearings.
Occasionally, he would persuade me to go up to the rooftop pool with him at   night when no one was there.
He was a gutsy guy, and he would leap up to the   33-story high ledge and try to get me to join him.
You have to be brave if   you’re going to take on those bastards,” he d say.
Then   he too walked out of my life, leaving me alone to face the trial.
The court date, October 31, 1973, was approaching when, a Professor and   researcher from Scotland, Dr.
Earlier, he had   interviewed others who had left Scientology.
I suspected was involved in my frame-up.
Doctors refused me, saying I could die from the anesthesia.
Finally, a neurologist, Dr.
David Coddon of Mount Sinai Hospital, agreed, and   after several hours of questioning me while I was out, he was so convinced I was   innocent, that he said not only would he testify for me, but he would chain   himself to the courthouse steps if they proceeded with this case.
Mysteriously, there was also an anonymous diary someone wrote of what I         did each day during the “frame-up” period, and how close I was to suicide.
And then I realized the writer could only have been Jerry Levin.
He must have   been a Scientologist whom they sent to   spy on me and help   Scientology set me up.
A new grand jury in New York spent 3 years investigating my frame-up.
One, a Charles Batdorf, was even jailed for   months for refusal to speak but still wouldn t talk.
11 Scientologists who were involved in wiretapping, infiltration and theft of   government documents.
Some had also been involved in the frame-up and harassment   of me so I finally had some justice.
I also  initiated my own legal actions   against Scientology while they piled on more suits, spies and harassment against   me.
Indirectly, through the lawyer who handled this settlement, I became   reacquainted with Paul Noble, a New York TV producer, whom I had dated in my   20 s, long before this all happened and we have been very happily married for 19   years  update:25  now.
True, it s not as  glamorous  as the investigative reporting I   did with Scientology, but at least dogs don’t harass and cats don’t sue.
I also quit smoking, barely drink, and try to forget what happened.
Try.
But when I see the news, or my e-mail, I’m often reminded of the years of   torment I endured.
Whenever I hear about litigation,or depositions, I remember   the years  and money  I spent fighting the 19 lawsuits they filed against me   from all over the world that I had to defend--not to mention that I was   subjected to 50 days of depositions.
Other names keep bringing me back as well.
My useless private investigator,   Anthony Pellicano, is all over the news.

Bob Straus, the   boyfriend who left me, went on to head a large New York organization that   investigates judges.

Dr.
Dr.
And while I’ve never heard   further of James Meisler or Charles Batdorf, I heard that Jerry Levin which I m   sure waas not his real name is still a Scientologist.
But then I remind     myself that I did help a lot of people.
My favorite was the man in his 50 s who   e-mailed me to say that years ago, after learning the truth about Scientology   from me, he left the cult, married, has 4 children  2 are twins  and now runs a   computer company employing 40+ people.
He wrote to tell me that he feels that I   am responsible for his happiness.
That reminded me of why I did what I did, and why we journalists do what we   do: we try to tell the truth so that we can help others.

Because Scientology is the knowledge of you.
Lawrence Wright is a staff writer at The New Yorker and a recipient of the Pulitzer Prize.
He lives in Austin, Texas.
The book is a look inside the world of Scientology and the life of its founder, L.
Ron Hubbard, who died in 1986.
4 million new converts each year.
Wright, who won a Pulitzer for his book The Looming Tower about the history of al-Qaida, has written throughout his career about the impact of religion on people s lives.
He reports that only 25,000 Americans actually call themselves Scientologists, and about 5,000 of those live in Los Angeles.
This includes some Hollywood actors; Wright says that almost from the time Hubbard founded Scientology, he hoped to attract members from Hollywood.
Church of Scientology in Hollywood and set up the Celebrity Center with the goal of attracting notable celebrities.
Gloria Swanson, the star of silent films, became a member.
If you get into Scientology, you will go to auditing.
It s like therapy except that there is an E-meter between you and your auditor.
That s a device that actually measures your galvanic skin responses.
It s two metal cans that you hold.
They used to be Campbell s Soup cans with the label scraped off.
A small current passes through it and there s a needle that registers your reaction, and that s what the auditor is looking at when you re responding.
Oftentimes in these circumstances you might remember — when pressed by the auditor — a previous existence, and this is given reality and validity by the E-meter.
If you have an image in your mind and the E-meter says — according to the auditor — this is something real, what is that?
He was taking gas for the dental surgery, and in the process he had, I think, what was a hallucination.
He believed that he had died and gone to heaven and his disembodied spirit floated through these gates and suddenly all the secrets of existence were revealed to him and all the things that people have been asking since the beginning of time about the meaning of existence.
And then, suddenly, these voices were saying,  No, no.
He s not ready.
But this was a big moment in Hubbard s career because suddenly he became interested in metaphysics.
And he wrote a book called Excalibur, which was never published, but it was based on the revelations he supposedly had achieved during this dental surgery.
If he were purely a fraud and a con man as many say, at some point he would have taken the money and run.
But he never did.
He spent his whole life elaborating the cosmology, the bureaucracy he created to support this church.
He spent the rest of his life — usually very much alone — elaborating his theories, the psychology, the religion that he was trying to create, the bureaucracy that s very intricate that supports it.
That s what he gave his life to.
So I think he really did believe, to some extent, that Scientology was real, but he was constantly inventing it.
We are all immortal souls, and part of Scientology is that you discover that in the course of your learning.
But there are presently eight levels of Operating Thetans.
When you get to Operating Thetan Level No.
3, there s a big discovery that you have in Scientology.
It was the most closely held secret in the church until it was put out and dumped into a courtroom in the  80s and all the copyrighted secrets of the church became public knowledge.
There s a widespread belief that he s going to return, and every Scientology church and his several residences and so on, they have his office ready for him.
His sandals are at the shower door.
He s got his cigarettes on his desk.
In his residence in the Scientology compound in southern California there s a novel beside his bed, and they change his sheets on his bed daily and they set a table place for him for one at his dining room table.

The hacker activist group Anonymous and the Church of Scientology have famously had it out with each other for the past several years, and it looks like the pot is beginning to boil again.
A member of Anonymous sent us an email describing Scientology s alleged abuse of Craigslist as a means to recruit new members.
Anonymous has attempted to use Craigslist s flagging system to take down their ads, as they are constantly violating terms of use with ridiculous amounts of postings in a number of cities across the United States and Canada.
Repeated e-mails to Craigslist about the constant violations of their terms of use had gone unanswered, so we started thinking out of the box and posting  counter ads .
There s another wrinkle to the story, however.
When we began posting more counter ads, our ads were flagged down within a minute or two of being posted.
Even before being live in the main list.
There are only two ways this could have happened: a  by flagging software, which is also illegal according to Craigslist and can supposedly result in permanent banning or b  by Craigslist themselves ignoring Co$ s posts and taking down ours, acting against their own policies and supporting the Church s position despite blatant misuse of the site.
We emailed Craigslist for their side of the story.
We ll update this post when we hear back.

On June 10 1999, there was a second ruling, this time in full procedure:     my page can still stay up.

Scientology has appealed this ruling.
On September 4 2003, the ruling in appeal was pronounced.
Again, the court deemed my quotes     to be fully legal.

Scientology   has appealed again, and the case is now before the Supreme Court, who will probably rule in    the summer of 2005.
On March 18 2005, the Attorney-General filed his advice to the Supreme Court about     Scientology s case against us.
In his opinion, all claims of Scientology should be discarded.

The Supreme Court s ruling was   planned for July 8 2005, but got postponed because Scientology suddenly dropped the case.
The Supreme    Court will decide later this year whether they will still rule on the matter.
On December 16 2005, the Supreme Court dismissed Scientology s appeal and made the previous ruling final.

The Church of Scientology  or: CoS; or: Co$, as some of their opponents call it  sells its followers expensive courses which, if students study them carefully, are supposed to set them free   clear  them .
A former Scientology member, Steven Fishman, was brought before court because he committed several crimes in order to get the money to pay for these courses.
Scientology urged him to get the money any which way he could.
According to Fishman, they also assigned him to kill somebody, and failing that, ordered him to commit suicide.
In an interview for Time Magazine, Fishman relayed those stories and blamed Scientology for his crimes.
Scientology sued him for slander.
When Fishman was then brought to court, he used parts of Scientology-documents to prove he had been brainwashed by the Church.
These Scientology documents thereby became public material: anybody could go to the court library and read them.
The Church, fearing that its sacred secrets would be revealed, had some of their people going to the library every day to borrow these documents, thereby preventing other people  read: non-Scientologists  from reading them.
50 .
Somebody retrieved the affidavit via the clerk, scanned it, and posted it to the net.
The Fishman Affidavit has been travelling on the Internet ever since.
The funny thing is, when you read the document, you ll just see a bunch of gibberish.
Apart from the instructions of how to treat non-Scientologists - almost every means is allowed to silence them; lying is common sense; cheating is part and parcel - there s just this silly and badly written science-fiction tale about Xenu who controls all of us people; except  of course  the few Scientologist who managed to  clear  themselves.
Well, L.
Ron Hubbard was an sf-author, but not a very good one  and jeez, I happen to like the genre .
But the real story is that Scientology does not want their followers to know what s in store for them: they forbid everybody to read this material until they ve done lots of courses, stating that it would kill those who are not yet ready for it; but more probably because people may stop believing Scientology once they ve read this lousy sf stuff.
And of course Scientology asks their followers massive amounts of money for the  privilege  of reading this.
To the best of my knowledge, the files here contain nothing but a court-document.
Indeed it does include some material that may or may not be copyrighted by RTC, Scientology s copyright bureau; but seeing that those fragments were included in the court-document, they may be published as part of that document.
In case somebody shows me that I included non-court materials  preferably by sending me a court-stamped copy of the original document , I will most certainly remove those parts of the material presented here.
Of course I would never want to publish copyrighted material of RTC other than that made public by the court, or outside of the fair use provenance.
I am thoroughly aware of the importance of copyright and copyright laws, and I do respect them.
Scientology does not argue with people who do not agree with them.
They prefer to harass, start crazy lawsuits, have people followed by private detectives, and generally intimidate them.
They do not sue in order to win; they sue in order to intimidate and harass.
See especially Exhibit B in the Fishman Affidavit: On Control and Lying   Currently, they are waging a war against Internet: trying to remove newsgroups, cancelling messages, forging messages, raiding providers.
Their motto is:  Never defend, always attack  and they are bent on ruining people who criticise them.
Scientology has ordered various raids on providers or computersystems from which documents exposing Scientology were available; most notably FactNet, a group of people who are putting together an on-line archive about Scientology.
In Holland they raided XS4ALL  where one of the users, Fonss, had a copy of the Fishman Affidavit on his homepage  and ordered XS4ALL to remove it.
XS4ALL refused to do so, stating that the content of people s homepage is not their responsibility and that they are not even allowed to interfere with what their customers put on their pages, provided that they re legal; and if anybody claims that a homepage is illegal, they d better present solid evidence.
Fishman Affidavit but provided a link on his page to another place where it could be obtained.
That is how I found it.
Ever since Scientology started to hunt down this document, the Fishman Affidavit is popping up everywhere.
It s a dragon: when you cut off one head, it grows seven new ones.
I hereby present another copy of this dragon.
Since mid September 1995, a number of reports on the Dutch Protest have been posted to the Internet-newsgroup that is devoted to discussion of CoS.
Concerning the lawsuit that Scientology presented me with and my subsequent defense for the court, read here for the Dutch version and here for the English version.
Scientology.
Your father wanted you to steal an H-bomb?
Yeah.
Why did Hubbard continue to publish Science Fiction after Scientology?
Respected German historian Guido Knopp has compared a speech by US actor Tom Cruise to the Church of Scientology with a call to war by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
The video above from a german documentary,  Missing in Happy Valley  and serves as an excellent introduction to this page about Scientology s roots.
The same individual that transmitted the various Magick tech to Adolf Hitler as a young man also transmitted them to Dad.
Justice Latey said that the tactics used by Hubbard and his helpers are  grimly reminiscent of the ranting and bullying of Hitler and his henchmen .
Russian Law expressly states that Scientology is a dangerous cult.
254 of Russian Health Ministry directly prohibits promotion and use of Scientology and Dianetics methods.
See this one classified, 1943 OSS evaluation of Hitler, go to page 26  HERE .
Hubbard had fondness for the number 8 and used it extensively in scientology, as in Hubbard s books named Technique 88, Scientology 8-80, and one called 8-8008.
1930 s, Hitler s SS - SS is the closest approximation in letters to 88.
Note the colors and feeling of the Scientology Management logo below from their own pages.

The magical cults of the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th centuries in the Middle East were fascinating.
In 1950, L Ron Hubbard wrote the book  Dianetics, the Modern Science of Mental Health.  In 1952, the term  Scientology  was introduced.
Corporate status was received by Scientology in 1954 in California.
Since that time,  Scientology  has been repeatedly questioned for it s bogus claims of medical healing and unexplained deaths.
Dianetics and Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard s personal references as a  war hero,  or  nuclear physicist,  are just a few of Scientology s false claims to recruit the unknowing.
Scientology didn t begin  acting  like, or operating as a  church  until 1969, when they were engaged in litigation with the FDA.
This may or may not be publically acceptable.
This is NOT the point.
Members carried  crossed out crosses  into their establishments and were told to wear ministerial collars.
Many of the methods and ideology that Hubbard used in Scientology are taken from other sources.
The mixture of using different teachings has long been associated to include the occult, since it is a known fact that L Ron Hubbard was familiar with the writings of  black magician,  Aleister Crowley s work since Hubbard was a teen.
Crowley, a self-declared  beast  and  anti-Christ,  once headed the British  Ordo Templi Orientis,   OTO  branch, and established those teachings in the United States in 1916, during World War I in Europe.
Crowley s OTO teachings of magick included the Golden Dawn and that of Thelemic Law.
Influences of Aleister Crowley are found in Scientology  technology,  or teaching materials - including L Ron Hubbard s own admission that he was the  anti-Christ.  Aleister Crowley died in 1947.
This was the same year that L Ron Hubbard directed members to bring in the crossed out cross and wear minister s clothing.
Another well known fact of L Ron Hubbard s association with Aleister Crowley and the teachings of magick was his relationship with John Whiteside Parsons.
O.
Parsons wrote to his  Most Beloved Father   emphasis - his term for Aleister Crowley  to acquaint him with events:  About three months ago I met Captain L.
Although he has no formal training in Magick, he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field.
From some of his experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel.
He describes his Angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guided him through his life and saved him many times.
True Story of L.
Ron Hubbard, 1987, Chapter 7,  Black Magic and Betty  pp.
1942 - Lodge moves to Parsons house.
Police investigate Parsons for the first time Parsons assumes role of acting head of Lodge.
March 2, 1946 - L Ron Hubbard returns, tells of  Empress.  Three day working with Cameron and Hubbard begins,  Book of Babylon  produced as result.
August 10, 1946 - Hubbard commits bigamy with an unsuspecting Betty Northrup.
1948 - Parsons takes his  Oath of the anti-Christ.  Hubbard visits first wife and children for last time.
L Ron Hubbard moved in with Jack Parsons, where they began the practice of the occult and sexual magick.
Parsons  mistress, Sara Northrup, left him for Hubbard and later became Hubbard s second wife, even before Hubbard had divorced his first wife.
Marjorie Cameron.
From page 24 of Gods and Beasts - the Nazi s and the Occult by Dusty Sklar  Pretzsche had introduced Hitler to consciousness-expanding drugs, as  well as to astrological and alchemical symbolism.
About 1912, disciples of Lanz and List started the Germanen Orden  under the leadership of a member of List s Armanen, a journalist named  Philipp Stauff, and several others.
Both being influenced by the ritual s and teachings of Aleister Crowley, Parson s acknowledged that Crowley s  Book of Thoth  was in Hubbard s possession at the time of this ritual.
The  Book of Thoth Tarot Card Deck  also holds some symbolism and influence that Hubbard used and vocalized in teachings to Scientology members.
Hubbard conveniently used  redefinition of words  to change meanings to cover the sources he was to use from.
Parsons put in hand the ritual preparations as indicated in the text.
On March 1 and 2, 1946, I prepared the altar and equipment in accordance with the instructions in Liber 49.
The Scribe, R** H***,  emphasis - Ron Hubbard*  had been away about a week, and knew nothing of my invocation of BABALON, which I had kept entirely secret.
On the night of March 2 he returned, and described a vision he had had that evening, of a savage and beautiful woman riding naked on a great cat-like beast.
He was impressed with the urgent necessity of giving me some message or communication.
We prepared magically for this communication, constructing a temple at the altar with the analysis of the key word.
He was robed in white, carrying a lamp; and I in black, hooded, with the cup and dagger.
At his suggestion we played Rachmaninov s Isle of the Dead as background music, and set an automatic recorder to transcribe audible occurrences.
At approximately 8 am he began to dictate, I transcribing directly as I received.
H*** s vision sounds a bit too glib to me.
It sounds rather like he d seen a copy of The Book of Thoth Atu XI, Lust, showing the Whore astride the Beast.
There would have been at least one copy of The Book of Thoth around Parsons  place, I would have thought.
Interestingly, in spite of H*** being referred to as  the Scribe , it was H*** who was giving utterance to  astral communications , and Parsons writing them down.
As far as the Babalon Working is concerned, H*** is the joker in the pack, the factor infinite and unknown.
His whole career, both before and after his involvement with Parsons, shows him to have been a confidence man par excellence.
Events after the Babalon Working, when he effortlessly swindled Parsons out of thousands of dollars, demonstrate that Parsons was as readily taken in as anyone.
It is surely legitimate for us to wonder, therefore, to what extent H*** s undoubted talents for deceit - both of himself and of others - coloured the whole Working.
Thanks to ex-scientologist Warrior for finding this image.
Significantly, this symbol is used in Aleister Crowley s  THE FOOL  Tarot Card in ways that reflect the Golden Dawn Teachings.
In his 1952 lectures, Hubbard also referred to the Tarot cards, saying that they were not simply a system of divination but a  philosophical machine .
The Fool of course is the wisest of all.
According to L Ron Hubbard Jr.
Crowley s successor; that he had taken on the mantle of the  Great Beast.   He told him that Scientology actually began on December the 1st, 1947.
Of course, the Tarot pack also contains the Empress card and knowing this it is finally possible to understand what Hubbard believed his Guardian Angel to be.
Crowley examined the Tarot in The Book of Thoth  032 .
Of the Empress card he said  She combines the highest spiritual with the lowest material qualities   033 .
Crowley identifies the Empress as the  Great Mother , and indeed on her robe are bees  034 , the traditional symbol of Cybele.
Crowley is not alone in the belief that different cultures give different names to the same deities.
C.
She entered Greek culture as Artemis and to the Romans was Diana, the huntress.
Crowley also identified the Empress with the Hindu goddess Shakti  035 , and the Egyptian goddesses Isis and Hathor.
Crowley directly identified Isis with Diana  036 .
More usually, Crowley called the Empress by the name Babalon  037 .
Bent Corydon, Messiah or Madman, p.
48 .
There are interesting similarities between Crowley s writings and the teachings of Hubbard.
Dianetics  Time Track, in which every incident in a person s life is chronologically recorded in full in the mind, is quite similar to Crowley s Magical Memory.
The Magical Memory is developed over time until  memories of childhood reawaken   5  which were previously forgotten, and memories of previous incarnations are recalled as well.
Hubbard gives examples in the Philadelphia Doctorate Course of several people remembering lives earlier on earth, some up to a million years ago.
Quote to son, L Ron Hubbard, Jr.
Sex by will,  he says.  Love by will -- no caring and no sharing -- no feelings.
None.
Love reversed.
Love isn t sex.
Love is no good; puts you at effect.
Sex is the route to power.
Scarlet women!
They are the secret to the doorway.
Use and consume.
Feast.
Drink the power through them.
Quote to son,  L Ron Hubbard Jr.
L Ron Hubbard Jr   Ron DeWolf  : I believed in Satanism.
There was no other religion in the house!
Scientology and black magic.
What a lot of people don t realize is that Scientology is black magic that is just spread out over a long time period.
To perform black magic generally takes a few hours or, at most, a few weeks.
But in Scientology it s stretched out over a lifetime, and so you don t see it.
Black magic is the inner core of Scientology --and it is probably the only part of Scientology that really works.
Also, you ve got to realize that my father did not worship Satan.
He thought he was Satan.
Perhaps he  decided that he was not going to make THAT same mistake again?
S WHERE I HID THE LOOT!
Coming from a guy that was almost hit by a freight train on venus, it makes perfect sense to me.
I knew a former top leader in the  OTO  organization that was re-designed by Crowley in the early 20th century.
Jim  told me that Hubbard was actually an  ultra-thelemist .
Thelema being the main philosopy propounded by Crowley that basically is usually interpreted as finding your true purpose or  true will  in life, and when you do that, you have a source of inexhaustible power.
The ultra thelemist believes anything he has the will to do gives him the right to do it, and the right to destroy anyone who crosses him.
The Church of Scientology  is a dangerous cult that foists its dogma upon the gullible public.
It oversees the practice of the for-profit religion created by science fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard  inaccurate rumour has it, as part of a bet with Robert A.
Heinlein  .
As a student of various sciences and a creative writer, Hubbard wrote a book called   Dianetics    to, essentially, start an unscientific experiment in human psychology based upon hypnosis , Freudian ideas, Buddhism , and other philosophies.
A few years later, he founded the Church of Scientology after claiming to have discovered the soul .
What followed became more and more ridiculous, as he produced everything from sacred recipes for baby formula to scriptures about alien overlords to massively expensive promises of supernatural abilities for dedicated followers.
Though all cults tend to be draconian about their dogma, after the advent of the internet , the Church became especially draconian in its attempt to stifle open discussion about Hubbard, Dianetics and Scientology.
In the late 1940s, pulp fiction writer L.
Hubbard did start his own religion, calling it the  Church of Scientology,  and it has grown into an enterprise that today grosses over $100 million a year worldwide.
This universe has long been looking for new ways to make slaves.
L.
Hubbard s experiment was well enough formed that his  religion  actually survives to this day, to the embarrassment of the human race.
It is also known to be the biggest money-making scam in history.
Sadly believers in Scientology do not survive as well as the belief system, far too many have died through Scientology related abuse, see Why are They Dead?
Scientology is an exploitative and coercive loony cult founded by science fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard, based on crackpot psychology , and populated by a mixture of the gullible, the insane, and the power-mad, as well as numerous people who combine all three.
It is also a satanic cult according to Dan Kennedy,  which is not strictly true; Hubbard was, however, a follower of Aleister Crowley whose Thelema faith was a forerunner of Laveyan Satanism.
There are a couple of interesting correspondences though.
Hubbard had a warped sense of humor .
Operating Thetans are OTs, while Crowley was a lover of Ordo Templi Orientis, OTO.
It has been widely criticized by groups such as Anonymous on the Internet and in the public at-large for legal threats and strongarm tactics, treating members abusively, bilking believers out of huge sums of money,  and believing humans evolved from clams .
Scientology claims you are under the influence of negative traumatic incidents that you need to become  clear  of.
This is done with   audit counseling   sessions using a quack primitive form of lie detector called an E-Meter .
Auditing sessions start cheap but get gradually more and more expensive and can suck the gullible convert into a cycle of needing ever more expensive auditing as the sessions uncover more traumatic incidents from past lives that they need to be  clear  of.
Spending your adult life in Scientology and going through all the levels, auditing sessions, and other courses will cost you between $300,000 and $500,000, which you would be much better off putting into a good mutual fund to save for retirement.
Scientology successfully   clears   money from the bank accounts of vulnerable practitioners.
L.
Ron Hubbard, 1952.
The first publication of Dianetics.
Scientology is the brain-child of science-fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard .
After serving not very well in World War II, Hubbard published  Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science  in the famous, peer-reviewed scientific journal Astounding Science Fiction in 1950,  followed shortly after by the book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health in 1950.
9] Dianetics described how all a person s problems were actually caused by  engrams  — subconsciously remembered experiences from former lives.
These engrams could be removed through a kind of therapy called  auditing .
Once free of such engrams, a person would be a   Clear  , and in full control of their mind and psyche.
As such they would have special abilities, such as perfect memory and analytical powers.
When Hubbard presented an alleged Clear to an audience in August 1950, those claims were shown to be slightly optimistic .
Predictably, Dianetics got the thumbs down from the scientific community , and Hubbard soon faced investigations by the Federal authorities for practicing quack medicine.
However, as Dianetics had gotten a positive response from lots of gullible people with too much money, Hubbard decided to turn it into a religion instead.
The first Church of Scientology was founded in 1953, hiding Hubbard s con scheme behind a screen of respectability and also avoiding lots of laws that didn t apply to churches.
But the Church s biggest treasure was tax exemption, which was granted to it in the US in 1957.
S.
L.
Ron Hubbard.
S.
Church .
Hubbard moved to the United Kingdom in 1959 and bought an old manor in Sussex called Saint Hill.
At that time Scientology was beginning to expand outside the US.
The manor was turned into the headquarters for this expansion and, eventually, for most international activities.
In the following years Hubbard consolidated Scientology, establishing many of the organization s fundamental policies and practices.
However, Scientology also attracted increased negative attention as it grew, so in 1966 Hubbard resigned as the formal head of the Church and instead bought a ship to use as his base; he began calling himself  Commodore  and established the Sea Org to act as his agents and assistants in Scientology.
During this time Hubbard and his followers traveled around the Mediterranean as Hubbard carried out his  research  on the OT levels.
He is known to have been strongly alcoholic and abusing drugs at the time.
Meanwhile, Scientology continued to expand in the US and abroad.
It founded several front groups, such as Narconon in 1966.
Also in 1966, the infamous Guardian s Office was established to counter threats to Scientology, both internal and external.
Government interest in the group was increasing.
In 1963, the FDA had seized a number of E-meters and charged the Church with making false claims about their ability to diagnose and treat illness and in 1967 the IRS revoked tax exemption from all Scientology-related entities in the US.
When the courts upheld this revocation in 1969, Scientology simply decided to withhold their owed taxes anyway, beginning a long war with the IRS that only ended in 1993.
While this was happening, Hubbard s flagship Apollo was established as the first  Advanced Org  and began offering Operating Thetan level III  the Xenu story  to members.
He also introduced a new strategy to Scientology in the late 60s when he realized that Hollywood celebrities would be obvious and useful targets for Scientology.
The first Scientology  Celebrity Center  opened in Los Angeles in 1970.
In the early 70s, US government investigations were becoming a serious problem for Scientology.
In response Hubbard launched  Operation Snow White , a large scale infiltration of several US government agencies that were believed to have taken an interest in Scientology.
Under the direction of the Guardian s Office, an estimated 5,000 agents infiltrated hundreds of government offices, stealing or destroying documents, tapping telephones, planting false information, and gathering material on officials to be used to blackmail them.
Sometime by the mid-70s Hubbard returned to the US where he went into hiding to avoid the authorities.
He remained on the run for the rest of his life, but always maintained contact with the Scientology organization through a group of people known as  Messengers .
The organization suffered a severe blow in 1977 when the FBI raided several of its offices and found evidence of Operation Snow White and other illegal activities.
Two years later, eleven top ranking members of the Guardian s Office, including Hubbard s wife Mary Sue Hubbard, were convicted and sent to jail.
Ron Hubbard himself was listed as a  un-indicted co-conspirator  at the trial.
The upheaval of the organization and Hubbard s absence  and likely worsening illness  allowed one of Hubbard s Messengers, David Miscavige to gradually assume control of Scientology.
As a Messenger, Miscavige spoke with Hubbard s authority, and he instigated a thorough reorganization of Scientology, with himself at the top.
Significantly, he closed the Guardian s Office and established the Office of Special Affairs in its place, essentially bringing the old car with just a paint job.
He also created the Religious Technology Center to license the all-important copyrights of Hubbard s works, and effectively run the entire Scientology organization.
As chairman of the RTC, Miscavige became the de-facto head of Scientology.
It is unknown whether this was according to Hubbard s wishes.
11] As the now undisputed head of Scientology, David Miscavige started a large-scale publication program of new versions of Scientology s books and courses.
12] The Sea Org also acquired a new ship at this time, the Freewinds.
Sea Org had been land-locked ever since its last ships had been sold in the mid- 70s, but now it returned to the waves, cruising the Caribbean and offering OT VIII levels to happy members.
Wins!
Scientology, and especially David Miscavige, scored an epic win in 1993 when they reached a settlement with the IRS over the taxes Scientology had been withholding ever since their tax exempt status was revoked in 1967.
5 million in back taxes the IRS relented and agreed to restore tax exempt status to Scientology and all related entities.
This new agreement extended the exemption to areas of Scientology that would not normally have been covered by normal charitable status, such as religious education.
14] It is believed that the agreement may have come about due to blackmail of top officials in the IRS.
Besides the obvious advantages of now effectively never having to pay taxes on any of their business, the agreement also made it easier for Scientology to push for similar recognition in other countries.
This allowed them to expand even further outside the US, especially in Europe.
The early and mid-90s also marked the first skirmishes in a long war between Scientology and the Internet.
1991 and became a regular hang-out for critics of Scientology.
15] Having failed epically to shut the newsgroup down in 1995, Scientology switched tactics and instead started flooding the group with trolls and apologists from the Sea Org and OSA.
Meanwhile, in Real Life, Scientology continued business as usual: expanding, clearing the planet, and screwing its rank-and-file members over so Miscavige could indulge in his love for expensive motorcycles and underwater photography.
Numerous law suits were filed against critics in attempts to shut them up.
Members such as Lisa McPherson  1995   and Stacy Meyer  2000   have died in mysterious circumstances.
Hilarious documents continued to leak to the public through court cases and ex-members.
But generally life was good.
In 1996-97 Miscavige launched the  Golden Age of Tech  program which was supposedly  based on  Hubbard s works.
In 2004, Miscavige built further on this success through the  Golden Age of Knowledge .
This is meant to be a complete re-release of all works by Hubbard, but as corrected, annotated and improved versions!
But not all has been well for Scientology recently, particularly in Europe.
The Greek authorities shut down the Church in 1997 after they  found it to be a profitmaking group that endangers the mental and physical well-being of its members.   The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution started monitoring Scientology activities in Germany in the mid-90s, considering them to present a potential danger to the democratic society.
In Belgium Scientology may be facing criminal charges after a 10 year long government investigation has uncovered evidence of fraud, organized crime, illegal medical practices and several other transgressions.
Meanwhile, a government committee in France has recommended dissolving the Church of Scientology there, on the grounds that its activities threatens public order  and seven of its top members are to stand trial in Paris on fraud charges after an investigation into allegations by a former member that the church swindled her out of more than $28,000.
France s top appeals court has upheld a fraud conviction and fines totalling hundreds of thousands of euros against the Church of Scientology, for taking advantage of vulnerable followers.
2008 kicked off with an even worse mess for Scientology when they fired probably their most epic footbullet to date.
Around January 14, an internal Scientology propaganda video was leaked on the Internet.
The video showcases irritating actor and Scientology front-person Tom Cruise rambling incoherently for ten minutes about how awesome Scientology is, punctuated by random crazy laughter.
23] Great lulz were had by all.
But then, in a move that showed their complete lack of comprehension of how the Internet works, Scientology filed a copyright complaint and had the video removed.
This attack on free speech roused the ire of the unwashed masses of Anonymous , who were moved to action in the way they knew best.
DDoS attacks were made, black faxes were sent, prank calls were made, and further lulz were had.
9000 Anonymous took his words to heart, put on Guy Fawkes masks and flooded into the streets of cities all over the world on February 10 to protest in front of Scientology Orgs.
The protests continued in the following months.
Anonymous has pledged to continue the fight for as long as it takes, making these protests probably the greatest threat to Scientology since the 70s.
Other extremely successful move has been Norway-based Operation Clambake , by Andreas Heldal-Lund, who nonetheless supports freedom of religion, shows the great scam Hubbard started and fed the people.
It also links to pro-Scientology pages to demonstrate that, at least, he hears to both sides of the debate.
Even if they only rant without proof.
However, the Internet s fight against $cientology suffered a bad hit when the Cult Awareness Network made a mistake  and a crime  by referring the family of a cult member towards a deprogrammer, who kidnapped said cult member.
The resulting trial against CAN  in which $cientology supported the plaintiff  ended with a great payment in trial costs and fines, which forced CAN into bankruptcy.
At this moment, $cientology came and bought all properties owned by CAN, which is now a front for them.
Hubbard was very opinionated about birth and infant nutrition.
Hubbard thought that talking in a delivery room could cause trauma for the baby and therefore delivery rooms should be as quiet as possible.
25] He also thought that the mother should use as little anesthetic as possible  — somehow a mother giving birth in pain doesn’t cause trauma for the mother or baby.
But who expects Hubbard to be rational?
Hubbard further disapproved of breast milk in situations where the mother s health was compromised — but he also rejected the baby milk formulas developed by experts in nutrition.
As usual, Hubbard thought he was a better expert than anyone else.
He surmised that since Roman soldiers ate a lot of barley, and that made them fit and strong, it had to be good for babies too.
Scientologist mothers still use the Hubbard baby formula.
27] Actual health care experts think the Hubbard formula is low in vitamins  vitamin C in particular  and can put the baby at risk.
Fair game: In a manner similar to the way the Singularity might punish those who never helped it , members can resort to extraordinary means of dealing with those they perceive as threats.
The Foxhole Atheist made this for a homework assignment.
Nice work.
The CoS will be at your door shortly.
The Sea Organization, or  Sea Org , is Scientology s  advanced religious retreat  but really forms part of its vast management and bureaucratic wing.
Promoted to members as some sort of utopian cruise ship in which the most advanced levels of Scientology are taught, those who have joined Sea Org instead found themselves required to sign a  billion year contract  with Sea Org, surrender their passports upon boarding, live in squalid group quarters with no privacy, perform menial chores as assigned, and suffer  punishments such as being locked in the chain locker for petty offenses.
Sea Org makes it deliberately hard to leave by issuing those who leave a  freeloader s bill , billing them for all the auditing and services received on the ship.
However, neither the  billion year contract  nor the  freeloader s bill  are legally enforceable and Scientology will never try to uphold them in a law court, knowing how hard a judge would laugh at them.
Scientology is particularly opposed to the psychiatric community and operates a front group , the Citizens Commission on Human Rights  CCHR , to engage in anti-psychiatry campaigns.
Scientology practise has a great deal in common with bad psychiatry.
Another front group is Narconon , a purported drug rehabilitation program  note the deceptively similar name to Narcotics Anonymous , and the support group for those living with alcoholics, Al-Anon .
Sterling Management Systems is a large group awareness training run by the Church of Scientology and promoted to doctors and dentists.
The Cult Awareness Network, originally a mainstream anti-cult organization founded 1978 in response to the mass suicide of Jim Jones followers, fell on hard times  due to aggressive litigation against it by Scientology and by Landmark Education and the Pentecostal  Life Tabernacle Church  , and its assets purchased from bankruptcy court in 1996 by the Church of Scientology, and now functions as a Scientology front group as well.
Scientology recruits heavily from celebrities, such as Tom Cruise , Isaac Hayes, and John Travolta.
It also attempts to take advantage of tragic situations, having sent  counselors  to ground zero in New York, water logged New Orleans, and even to Virginia Tech in 2007  their van actually parked outside of this author s building in Blacksburg .
However, they aren t there to help, but to actually attempt to muscle out legitimate grief counselors on the scene.
Most directly related to Scientology are the small groups collectively referred to as the Free Zone , consisting mostly of former Scientologists who continue to practice Scientology, but do so outside the official Church of Scientology.
Scientology refers to all these as  squirrel organizations , a Hubbard term for anyone who appropriates Scientology doctrines outside the Co$.
Participation in anything labeled  squirrel  by the Co$ is automatic grounds for being declared a  suppressive person   persona non grata  and cut off from any further involvement in the  church  — and often actively harassed by them.
Less clearly related as to what extent they still incorporate Scientology teachings are former Scientologists who later went into business for themselves.
These include Kevin Trudeau , late-night infomercial purveyor of books  they  don t want you to read; Werner Erhard , of 1970s pop-psychology seminar fame; Re-evaluation Counseling a mixture of Dianetics with Marxism ; the Process Church of the Final Judgment  an alleged Satanist group with rumored ties to Charles Manson, although it is unclear what ties ; and Harry Palmer s Avatar, a large group awareness training seminar.
Neo-Tech borrows heavily from Scientology s quasi-sci-fi style and imagery, but their main influence is Ayn Rand .
Is Scientology a religion?
There is some debate about whether Scientology is, in fact, a religion.
Although one test could be whether it is recognised as such by the states in which it operates, this is not, in practice, very helpful.
For instance it is not recognised as a religion in Belgium, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Canada and the UK; however it is recognised as a religion in Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, and the USA.
In other countries such as Austria and Germany the legal position is unclear.
On the Scientology main page it refers to itself as a religion,  saying,  The religion comprises a body of knowledge extending from certain fundamental truths.   However, it could well be argued that the fact that it self-identifies as a religion does not necessarily mean that it is, in fact, a religion.
In its own description it also includes phrases such as:  Man is an immortal, spiritual being.  and  Through Scientology, people all over the world are achieving the long-sought goal of true spiritual release and freedom.  which certainly sound religious in nature.
However it must be remembered that what Scientology says openly to the world, and what Scientology says secretly to its  advanced  members are two different things — and consequently it is not necessarily wise to take at face value anything which may appear on their public site.
It could be maintained that one mark of a religion would be the belief in a God, Gods or other spiritual entities.
Does Scientology have such a belief?
Apparently at the higher levels they have  thetans  — dead space aliens — though it would probably be stretching the matter to call them  spiritual entities .
Another element usually common in religions is the question of faith .
However on their front page they say:  In Scientology no one is asked to accept anything as belief or on faith.  which would seem to exclude them from the religious world.
On the other hand, as we noted above, what Scientology says — and what is the actual truth — are two different things.
Does it match other accepted definitions of religion?
On the face of it, Scientology would seem to match many of the definitions included in our religion article.
Bad movie night!
Scientology has a free movie they show called Orientation.
You can only watch it at your local Church of Scientology.
Actually, that s not true.
Somebody posted a bootleg copy to YouTube and Google Video, but the Church of Scientology forced it down due to copyright threats.
Somehow it still keeps popping up on the Internet though.
Watch it here while you can.
That way you can watch it without having to give them your name and address and being pestered by them.
Scientology again, that is fine with us.
There is another leaked Scientology video at the Tom Cruise article.
The Internets v.
In 1996 a popular anonymous remailer in Finland chose to shut down after Scientology demanded the identities of two users.
Several people who posted what the  church  considered their proprietary material have been sued and their homes and computers raided.
A partial timeline of these early events can be found here .
In 2008, in response to Scientology forcing a leaked Tom Cruise video off the  net, some unruly anonymous 1337 hax0rz types were holding regular protests at Scientology  churches  around the world, posting their communiques on YouTube, campaigning for revocation of Scientology s tax-exempt status and generally making merry pranksters out of themselves  while enjoying delicious cake .
This movement, known as Project Chanology, is spiraling out of control and running circles around the Church of Scientology.
Since the first protest in February 2008, monthly protests have been held all over the world, including L.
Ron Hubbard s joyous birthday celebration in March, the infamous Operation: Sea ARRGGHHH!
June, and the insidious Operation: Spy vs.
Sci in July.
Outside of the monthly protest schedule, miniraids and surprise enturbulations are happening regularly.
Operations are carried out according to plan across all fronts and will continue as needed until the objectives are reached, or, well, until something more interesting turns up.
Project Chanology is decentralized and its goings-on all over the Internet can be seen on any search engine .
Anonymous has, as a result of this, declared all out war.
They have pledged to fight no matter how long it takes.
This will probably be quite a while, so don t hold your breath.
Anonymous often uses suspicious deaths of members to advance their cause.
Deaths of Scientologists have founded numerous theories about abuse.
A case in point is Lisa McPherson.
She was taken from the hospital by Scientologists due to the fact that she had gone to a psychologist after a car crash  Scientologists don t like psychology .
She was kept in their hotel for a few days.
When the Scientologists finally took her to a hospital again, she was pronounced dead upon arrival.
She was emaciated, dehydrated, and her hands had cockroach bites.
33]  They were indicted with two charges of felony, but the charges were dropped after a medical examiner declared the death an accident.
35] A lawsuit was later brought against the Co$, which was settled.
After many Scientologists coordinated actions to make self-serving edits, Wikipedia banned the entire CoS from editing.
It was the fourth Scientology-related case on the site, which just goes to show that they re more trouble then they re worth.

Tom Cruise - Probably the man whom most Americans think of when they think of Scientology.
He s probably best known  for going on the Today show and arguing with Matt Lauer that it was okay for him to condemn Brooke Shields for taking medicine to help with her postpartum depression.
John Travolta - A bit less vocal about his religion than Tom Cruise, although he did produce a movie version of Hubbard s Battlefield Earth which is considered to be one of the worst movies of all time.
Isaac Hayes - The soul singer and voice of  Chef  in South Park.
He left the show after claiming that it did not respect religion — well, his religion at least.
Nancy Cartwright - The voice of Bart Simpson on The Simpsons.
She caused a bit of an uproar when she used Bart s voice in an unauthorized manner to promote the church.
Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley  see:  ex-followers  below  - Some have suspected that Lisa Marie s marriage to Michael Jackson may have been an attempt to get him to join the church.
Chick Corea - Noted jazz musician.
Allegedly, Stanley Clarke quit the group Return to Forever after a falling out with Chick following Clarke s decision to leave the cult.
Jason Lee - Mallrats and My Name Is Earl actor.
Actually, a disturbingly high number of the actors and writers involved in My Name Is Earl are Scientologists.
Anne Archer -  80s almost-ran actress.
Yep, that s where she went.
Is probably Scientology s nearest equivalent figure to the Virgin Mary, as her son, Tommy Davis, heads up the organisation s Celebrity Center in Los Angeles.

Peaches Geldof - Formerly one of the dumbest persons on the entire planet.
Seriously, watch that Fearne Cotton meets Peaches Geldof documentary and you will have your IQ slashed in half.
Seems to have moved on to Thelema before she died.
Paul Haggis  film director & producer:  Crash ,  Million Dollar Baby    Quote:  I could not, in good conscience, be a member of an organization where gay-bashing was tolerated .
Haggis also said he was  shocked  that the Church of Scientology was publicly denying that it adheres to a policy of disconnection – of severing ties with a friend or family member who s antagonistic toward Scientology, as his wife was given precisely those orders and didn t speak to her parents for more than a year.

Some former members might complain about  bad experiences  they had or claim to have had.
So, obviously they decided not to do something about it and left the organization.
Maybe it was not the right thing for them.
Just as most other religious organizations Scientology does not hold members who do not want to be members.
Scientology practices do not work properly if done under pressure or false premises.
So who wants to go, should leave or help to remedy perceived wrongs.
Ex-members who try to make a living as  experts  on the faith they abandoned are clearly not neutral and not a good source for anything related.
Q: What is the  Int Ranch  or  Happy Valley School ?
The actual name of this school was Castile Canyon School and it existed from 1990 to 2000 in California.
The school was called the  Int Ranch  by its students, all of them kids of Church of Scientology staff members.
The school made a media appearance when ex-Scientologist and   Posse   member Jenna Hill pushed out ridiculous claims about her time there.

Q: What happened to Lisa McPherson?
Lisa McPherson was a Scientologist who died from a blood clot as a result of a car accident.
Some corrupt individuals tried to profit from the death of this girl and make a lot of noise about it.
That s why you know about it.
Here is the real story.
Lisa McPherson died of what the doctors called a pulmonary embolism  blood clot .
Other statements first made by Medical Examiner Dr.
Joan Wood were found unfounded, as she herself agreed when she was presented with all the evidence.
None of the top medical experts around the country who have been consulted on this matter agreed with Wood s conclusions.
When the medical examiner looked at all the facts she came to the conclusion that Lisa McPherson suffered an accidental death as a result of a pulmonary embolism caused by an injury to her leg in the auto accident.
All charges against the Church were dismissed by the prosecutor .
When the judge in the civil suit was presented the evidence he ruled that Lisa McPherson was at the Church of her own free will and dismissed a major portion of the case.
The remaining part of the civil case ultimately settled in 2004.
Lisa was not mistreated, she was willingly in the care of friends.
She did not lose 50 lbs.
These are lies invented to align with a harassment campaign against the Church of Scientology and its members.
The medical examiner determined that Lisa died of natural causes .

ASI - Applied Scholastics  International, a cult educational front group.
Scientology is, as indicated by the name, the study of science.
Historically this referred to the scientific study of any topic and the scientific method itself, the  science of science .
In this sense of meaning, scientology is not to be confused with psychology , the non-rigorous, most often prejudicial, and inherently unscientific study of many of the same topics or with psychiatry ,  a major world religion, which, however, has a - in a comparative socio-religious context - rather unusual corporate front end, consisting of socalled pharmaceutical companies producing pills, believed  by its followers to produce beneficial effects to the psyche.
Before the 1950s there was no scientific study of any topic whatsoever by anyone.
Also, colours did not exist save for black and white nuances.
In 1950, Elrond Hubbard , the founder of Scientology, as a precursor to his main work, published the book  Callanetics , a self-help and exercise system conceived and designed to reach the deepest layers of the psyche and deep tissue muscle groups - with the subject achieving peace of mind and rock-hard washboard abs in the proces.
The proceeds from the sales of the book also made the author obscenely rich and thus able to pursue his true passion, developing scientific theory and applying it to the human mind.
In 1952, Hubbard by releasing the book  Scientology  gave birth to modern scientific study, ardently insisting that any scientific theory should be verified - or at least not falsified - by experimental fact, proposing the now well known cycle of science, including the steps  audit, explain, predict, control .
The need for reproducable data led Elrond Hubbard to pursue the development of scientific testing equipment,  most notably the socalled e-meter, a device measuring electric brain activity through the subject holding two pieces of conducive metal tied by conducive wire to each end of a hollow plastic box with a randomly vibrating needle on top of a series of digits arranged clockwise.
It was developed in cooperation with Vollney Matthison, the random guy who was the first person Hubbard encountered in the street, when -  in a feat of rage - Hubbard stormed out his office building, stopping to ask Matthison if HE could pin this damn electrical circuit-wire-stuff to this plastic box, without breaking both, a feat untill then not acomplished by Hubbard himself, coincidently the source of the aforementioned fit.
Modern versions of the e-meter do not require the test subject to hold conductors, but to stand barefooted directly on the meter which then digitally shows a random number  see also: bathroom scale  .
The  decades following the publication of  Scientology  brought vast amounts of new knowledge into existence as well as groundbreaking advances in technology.
As scientology has taught us that correlation implies implication, this is generally attributed to Scientology.
75 million years ago, Xenu, the tyrant alien ruler of the Galactic Confederacy, a group of 76 nearby planets, hatched an evil plan.
Because the confederacy was suffering from overpopulation, he told billions of his fellow aliens that they were being taken to earth for tax auditing, and brought them here in spacecraft resembling Douglas DC-8 airliners.
Xenu stacked the spacecraft around volcanoes and detonated hydrogen bombs inside the volcanoes, killing all the aliens inside, but inadvertently releasing their souls, or Thetans.
Xenu ordered the capturing and brainwashing of these Thetans, and once performed, allowed these indoctrinated creatures to remain on earth as humans began to evolve, where they attach themselves to humans and contribute to the problems that plague human civilisation.
The thetan, is trapped in matter, energy, space and time,  MEST .
Scientology aims to restore the thetan to a state of  total freedom  from MEST to  rid the thetan of  engrams , recordings of distressing experiences from this and previous lives.
000 people world wide pursuing rigourous study of science.
000 people world wide have actually read a book.
Scientologist hold that it is a basic obligation of any scientologist to further the cause by spending vast amounts of money on scientific litterature, educational seminars, and testing equipment, until the scientologist s bank account is empty, a state known to scientologists as  clear .
Once reaching the state of clear, further study will bring the subjects to succeedingly levels of academic achievement, the aim of which is to ultimately be allowed to perform - increasingly complex forms of - brain surgery in which case the scientologist is refered to as an  Operating Thetan .
Historically, persons applying themselves dilligently to the rigourous study of nature have often been the source of envy and considered legitimate targets of ridicule and even persecution.
Such practices have included: being burned alive at the stake, ex-communication from the church and eternal damnation to the fiery depths of Hell, and being beat the crap out of by the Junior High School bully.
It is thus no wonder, that scientologists have found themselves subjected to modern day equivalents of these practices.
Many countries have  - contrary to the wishes of scientologist - labelled scientology as a religious belief , possibly related to UFO religions.
Although benefical for tax-purposes, scientologists generally disapprove of this, as its practices are not considered a matter of mere belief, and scientologists have thus gone to great lengths, including court cases, to avoid this label.
The re-classification of scientology as a religious belief, has happened most notably in countries where the religion of psychiatry through lobbying exerts notable influence on legislators, including the US, where the IRS has decided scientology is legally considered a religious belief, under the  If it does not make sense, it is a religious belief -doctrine.
This doctrine was first established by the landmark Supreme Court case  the IRS vs. A Group of People Whom the IRS would Like to Annoy .
Although it pains me,  the facts at hand, that is to say, the specific wording of the First and Fourteenth Amendments leaves us with no other alternative than to conclude  that the founding fathers have seen fit to afford equal protection under the law to other religious  beliefs  than my own .
It thus only remains for this Court to establish whether the tenet examined in this case, that is to say, that any disagreement,  on whether a given proposition on facts is to believed to be true, can be settled by examining the facts at hand, er, whether this idea can be most aptly categorized as a  belief  or as a  fact .
It is settled case law, that in order to enjoy protection, a  belief  need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or any other way make sense.
Indeed, if these were cumulative or even alternative requirements,  the tenet would not be called a  belief  but a  fact .
I thus believe that it is a matter of fact that the tenet examined is a  belief  and it is a fact that this belief of mine is protected by the Constitution.
This last remark caused legal scholars a bit of confusion as Scalia had the deciding vote, and thus the majority only became the majority when he cast his vote for it.
Also because this was the first time ever that he sided with the majority.
IRS vs.
The most important example of a country which - in contrast - refuses to label scientology as religion, is Germany, which has thus become a refuge and beacon of hope to scientologist world wide.
Tom Cruise - though not himself engaged in direct scientific study, American actor Tom Cruise is a staunch defender of Scientology and has on more than one occasion threatened to throw anyone who claims    Xenu   is a mere myth, in the nearest volcano.
Bart Simpson - though not publicly confirmed by the cartoon character himself, there is just something with that voice of his that screams scientology, I don t know?
Luke Perry is a scientologist.
However, in fact no credible evidence has ever been produced, that Luke Perry has ever rigourously studied ANY  topic, whether scientific or not, nor that he is even able to read.

The Church of Scientology, known for celebrity and controversy, is now in the middle of another public relations crisis as a former high-ranking official has created a firestorm, first with an email to church members and then testimony in a Texas state court alleging she saw the church s leader punch another executive in the face, and that at his direction she herself was slapped.
For 17 years Debbie Cook ran the church s spiritual mecca, the so-called Flag Base in Clearwater, Florida, where she ultimately rose to the title of captain.
But Cook testified this month that beginning in 2005 she saw behavior exhibited by church leader David Miscavige that disturbed her deeply.
I witnessed Mr.
Cook testified in court.
A few weeks later in an interview with ABC News, Cook repeated that assertion.
She also said -- as she had testified -- that Miscavige never hit her, but that he ordered his assistant to slap her, and that slap was so hard that Cook was knocked down.
In numerous letters to ABC News, Scientology officials have denied that David Miscavige ordered Debbie Cook to be slapped, or that he punched a fellow executive.
She also testified that the trailer was infested with ants, that they slept in sleeping bags on the floor, and that on several occasions, the electricity was cut and the temperature reached 106 in the trailers.
During this time, Cook testified, she and other executives were repeatedly pressured to confess their alleged misdeeds.
The letter states that Ms.
When Cook and her husband decided to leave the Church of Scientology in October 2007, they signed lengthy contracts agreeing not to publicly criticize Scientology or its leaders, and in return received checks for $50,000 apiece.

Can the Church Deny It?
Ron           Hubbard, whose sentiments appear racist to modern sensibilities but were common in white society during most of his life.
A basic component of the Church s services is auditing  counseling           sessions .
Scientologists can advance their spiritual condition.
The South African native is probably the one impossible person to              train in the entire world — he is probably impossible by any              human standard.
1968, The American St.

Natives need the help of white men to explain how to care for their           possessions, including their land.
As long as a white foreman is there, they will prevent soil              erosion; but the moment that a white foreman turns his back — boo!
There goes the whole program.
And you finally get up to the point of where he s               supposed to take care of something, a lesson which has never been              taught to the native of South Africa.

Hubbard also finds that the  insanity rate per capita in South Africa           is appalling  and issues a special set of instructions, The Scientific Treatment of the Insane ,           for South African auditors to address the problem.
Note that Hubbard           also thinks the Bantu are in need of  rehabilitation , with           mental health being only one of the necessary efforts.
The insanity rate per capita in South Africa is appalling.
Scientology rundown targeted at a specific ethnic group, was           developed for  delivery to South Africans—those who reside in           South Africa as well as those who have emigrated to other parts of           the world .
Hubbard apparently feels that they required special           processing because they are  untrainable  and  insane .

Because the one thing — the very, very commercial little              culture the Bantu has … the idea of commerce and money and              that sort of thing is very deeply ingrained in these people.
African tribesman, with his complete contempt for              truth and his emphasis on brutality and savagery for others but              not for himself, is a no-civilization.

Y]ou ll find in Africans a fantastic amount of heavy space opera              and so on, going on … which makes the colored African very,              very interesting to process because he doesn t know why he goes              through all these dances … and why he feels so barbarous ….
27 November 1959.
In Hubbard s view, people have to be trained to be             governable             in order to become civilized and deserve independence.
He suggests           that this was the problem in Cameroon, undergoing internal strife on           its way to independence from France and England, because there was no           one there to  give civilization to .
They took people who were totally dedicated to certain tribal              procedures … and said,  You re free.  And they said,  Free.              Free? Free. Ah! You mean there s no police anymore.  Boom!
Boom!

There are hints that Scientology membership was limited to whites, at           least initially, in their organizations in southern Africa.
In the           first quote below, Hubbard is concerned about the World Bank taking           control of England and the general advance of Communism.
Africa to salvage white society .
In the second quote, Hubbard praises the South African organization,           that, in spite of the limited white population from which to recruit,           managed to outproduce all other Scientology organizations.
Now if we can get white population, immigrants and big companies              and so on moving into Africa and if we can get with that              Scientology well established in Southern Africa, why we can then              look forward to a salvage operation base, in case the northern              hemisphere s lights go out.
8 million or              thereabouts, you can see that every other central organization in              the world has been out-created.
Hubbard sought to create a Scientology homeland in South Africa or           Rhodesia  Zimbabwe .
The Church claims it opposed the white minority           governments  most of its activity in the early years took place in           colonial states where whites ruled and English was the official           language: England, United States, Australia, South Africa, Rhodesia .
Hubbard, however, appears to have thought the problem of apartheid was overstated.
The problem of South Africa is different than the world thinks.
There is no native problem.
The native worker gets more than white              workers do in England!
The South African government is              not a police state.
It s easier on people than the United States              government!
It is considered in England and the United States that the              Government of South Africa is altogether too harsh with its native              peoples.
It is sadly humorous to notice that the native in South              Africa, however, holds an exactly reverse opinion and the fault he              finds with the South African Government is that it is far too              lenient in its administration of laws throughout the native              populace.
PAB No.
One reason Hubbard was attracted to Rhodesia was his admiration for Cecil Rhodes ;           he even claimed to have been Rhodes in a previous life.
Rhodes originated the racist land grabs in South Africa,           suggesting that  we must find new lands from which we can easily           obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap slave           labour that is available from the natives of the colonies .
Hubbard s expertise in handling the natives ,           who were a great resource that was not             well utilised at all  ,           was probably a continuation of his former lifetime s experience.
For instance, my boy Jamble … I used to tell him  yes, I              know Jamble — you re a good boy even though you do drink and              smoke dacca and gamble — that has nothing to do with me,              you re still a good boy  and you know he came way up tone arm.
I              noticed he drank less and I think he stopped smoking dacca              entirely but he didn t stop gambling because Master used to give              him a pound to go out to the race track and lose.
Bantu, the Mshombe, the              Matabele, these people are very hard-working people and under              proper direction are quite productive.
But they served with great enthusiasm.
Those people sure can work.
The African sure can work.
That s one thing nobody has ever quite              noticed about them.
They are very hard-working people.
Having viewed slum clearance projects in most major cities of the              world may I state that you have conceived and created in the              Johannesburg townships what is probably the most impressive and              adequate resettlement activity in existence.

He suggests ways that the Church could serve the           apartheid agenda, for instance, using e-meters to interrogate suspects and to uncover agent provacateurs.
In Hubbard s world, the deplorable           conditions of non-white citizens did not give rise to the protests,           instead, it was outside agitators  usually Communists  who were to           blame — a view in alignment with the government s.
Hubbard sees indigenous people as carefree  natives  dancing in the jungle ,           or agitators trying to overthrow the colonial government because they           haven t been properly primed for civilization.
Illiterate cultures do not survive and they are not very high.
The              natives of the tribe of the Bugga Bugga Booga Boogas down in Lower              Bugga Wugga Booga Woog are mostly no longer with us, or they are              around waving red flags today and revolting against their central              government.
And they didn t learn fast.
Their literacy was not up to absorbing              culture rapidly.
They ve been very happily down amongst the bong-bong trees, you              know, dancing up and down amongst the bong-bong trees, and the              highest level of their interest and so forth was their own back              yard.
You shouldn t be scrubbing the floor on your hands and knees.
Get              yourself a nigger; that s what they re born for.
The white goes further.
He often believes he can get attention              only from whites and that yellow and brown people s attention is              worthless.
Thus the yellow and brown races are not very              progressive, but, by and large, saner.
Now we say there s, well, another place in the world—there s              India.
Wonderful place — except for its people.

Arab races at           all.
In North Africa they had the Arab with the gun and whip, but he              could force people to do things … and he accomplished a              tremendous amount of extermination, but he certainly didn t              advance that civilization very much.
1968, The American              St.
He s  been going crazy steadily and gradually ever since              he lost the early very fertile basins of the Middle East.
He s              been going crazy ever since he failed to learn wheat farming and              brought about the erosion of all of the fertile areas of the              Middle East.
This race has been going for a very, very long time and has been              eating death for a very long time and it is death.
They              have eaten death too long and now they bring death to the things              they touch.
The Arab is to a point where he won t even follow a decent leader.
He s got to have a man of blood, a man of cruelty, exaggeration              and bigotry.
Then he ll follow him.
Arab is trying to be pleased with death and murder and              mayhem and disease and poverty and political unrest.
Those small brown men who sell their sisters on the streets of              Cairo were once the mighty Egyptians.
Ostensibly there is little antisemitism in Hubbard s works, but on           the rare mention of Jews, he upholds common antisemitic myths.
Willis Carto,  perhaps the most influential professional           anti-Semite in the United States   -Anti-Defamation League .
Hubbard suggests the worldwide conspiracy against him and           Scientology can be tracked back to the             Jewish bankers             who are funding his arch enemy, the World Federation of Mental Health.
Now it s of peculiar interest to an Arab country that there is a              company and a certain set of bankers who also finance the World              Federation of Mental Health.
KGB and so forth seems to be associated with the World Federation              of Mental Health, their other organization in action seems to go              back to Jewish Bankers.
Another fairly common antisemitic notion that Hubbard embraces is           that an obsession with sex is a natural characteristic of the Jewish  race  .
Furthermore,  had a racial fixation on sex, a              fixation sufficiently pronounced to cause it to infect              contagiously all modern European stock.

Viet Nam and how           ANZO  Australia New Zealand Oceania  would stand alone to face the           threat of Communism, which, in Hubbard s view, was part of the           psychiatric conspiracy to rule  and ruin  the planet.
Apparently           Hubbard is dismayed at the prospect of an influx of Asians into Scientology in the area, if their attention was diverted from           war with the Americans.
This is the only way I know of to keep Anzo from being deluged              with Asiatic hordes.
Japanese is a baby talk — very, very hard to read, very,              very, easy to talk.

One of the reasons they  have bad eyesight is              probably these microscopic characters  which have many lines and              strokes to them.
