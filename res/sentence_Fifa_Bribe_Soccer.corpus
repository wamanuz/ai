ZURICH --  FIFA s bribery scandal spread Monday beyond allegations about the presidential election to include the selection of Qatar as the 2022 World Cup host, with evidence that FIFA s second in command suggested the desert nation had  bought  the right to host the world s biggest single-sport event.
Qatar s World Cup organizers swiftly denied the implication made in a private email from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.
I have at no time made, or was intending to make, any reference to any purchase of votes,  Valcke said in a statement about his email to FIFA vice president Jack Warner, who was provisionally suspended Sunday.
Qatar 2022 said it was  urgently seeking clarification from FIFA about the statement from their General Secretary.
The issue compounded the problems for FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who spoke publicly Monday for the first time since Warner and his former challenger Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar were suspended.
The Swiss leader said Monday that in recent days the scandals had done  great damage to the image of FIFA.
After years of dismissing claims of corruption, FIFA caved in Sunday, an extraordinary day in its 107-year history.
Warner and bin Hammam were suspended after an inquiry into allegations that Caribbean soccer leaders were paid $40,000 each to back bin Hammam s now-abandoned presidential bid.
At the same time, FIFA s ethics panel cleared Blatter of ignoring the alleged bribery plan, and left him as the sole candidate Wednesday for the biggest job in the world s most popular sport.
Warner -- the suspended head of the 35-nation North, Central American and Caribbean  CONCACAF  regional body -- told British broadcaster Sky he would consult a Swiss judge about the legality of the suspension, even though FIFA statutes prohibit soccer officials from seeking verdicts at a national court.
Or he thought you can buy FIFA as they bought the WC.
Whistle-blowers and suspected bribe-takers gathered together as FIFA seeks more evidence in the next 30 days for the inquiry.
FIFA s gravest corruption crisis was sparked by a file of evidence submitted by Chuck Blazer, the American general secretary of CONCACAF and a longtime FIFA executive panel member.
Newspapers in Egypt were especially critical of the 75-year-old Blatter, who is seeking a fourth term as leader of world soccer s governing body.

German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer received a 90-day ban from scandal-plagued FIFA on Friday.
BRASILIA — German World Cup-winning player and coach Franz Beckenbauer was banned for 90 days by FIFA on Friday after failing to cooperate in a corruption inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Beckenbauer was part of the FIFA executive committee which voted to give the tournament to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, with the Qatari bid marred by allegations of vote buying.
The apparent breach relates to Mr Beckenbauer’s failure to cooperate with an Ethics Committee investigation despite repeated requests for his assistance,” FIFA said in a statement.
Michael Garcia is investigating the decisions on behalf of world soccer’s ruling body and is due to file his findings next month.
The evidence that could strip Qatar of the 2022 World Cup has landed at FIFA.
Qatar and Russia, the 2018 host, were chosen in December 2010 by FIFA s widely discredited executive committee.
The report sets forth detailed factual findings; reaches conclusions concerning further action with respect to certain individuals; identifies issues to be referred to other FIFA committees; and makes recommendations for future bidding processes,  FIFA said in a statement.
Garcia sought to interview all the FIFA board members involved in the 2018-2022 bid contests, though it is unclear how many cooperated.
The reports, delayed since July, will now be examined by FIFA ethics judge Joachim Eckert, who can impose sanctions.
Eckert, however, can seek follow-up interviews or  return the final report to  Garcia s  investigatory chamber for amendment or completion,  according to FIFA s code of ethics.
Eckert could apply sanctions against any of the nine bid candidates, their staffers or officials who were FIFA executive committee members in 2010.
Within days of the vote, the integrity of Qatar s bid was in question from suggestions soccer could not be played in 40-degree desert heat of June and July.
Qatar has been the subject of more damaging allegations, often from British media and including whistleblowers claims, that it bought support and influence from FIFA voters.
In 2010, Qatari official Mohamed bin Hammam was a key powerbroker on the FIFA board.
A former longtime Blatter ally, he was accused of bribing Caribbean voters during his failed bid for the FIFA presidency in 2011.
Bin Hammam won a legal fight to overturn a FIFA life ban in that case, but was expelled again in 2012 over financial management when he was Asian Football Confederation president.
Several voters in 2010 have since resigned from FIFA while under investigation for financial wrongdoing, and others have been subject to unproven allegations for seeking favors.
There is little doubt that FIFA would have wished for more positive headlines entering the latest staging of their showpiece event.
The 2014 World Cup has already proved one of the most problematic for soccer’s governing body, with delays over the building of stadiums and protests in Brazil about the way in which public money has been spent, distracting coverage from the potential action on the pitch and causing plenty of headaches at FIFA headquarters.
The release of documents by Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper last week, detailing fresh allegations about bribes changing hands in order to secure Qatar the 2022 World Cup, has ramped up the controversy about the award of the competition to the small desert nation with little history of soccer.
Such accusations have been rife from the moment president Sepp Blatter announced Qatar as having won a vote among FIFA’s executive committee in December 2010.
The scrutiny has been such that FIFA, no stranger to allegations of impropriety, have even launched their own investigation, led by former New York attorney Michael Garcia.
From their base in Zurich, Switzerland, FIFA has thus far been allowed to run almost as a law unto themselves.
Such an attitude is perhaps understandable, given that there has been little to suggest FIFA’s flagship product has yet been tainted by a widespread suspicion about the activities of the organization.
Anyone in Brazil over the next month will not be able to move for paraphernalia promoting FIFA’s blue-chip sponsors.
While FIFA may be able to ignore the common fan in the stands or in front of television sets across the globe, in the knowledge that they will continue to absorb the product on the pitch regardless of the unsavory distractions off it, a threat to their sponsorship revenue will surely be taken seriously.
And such threats may be forthcoming, with several of FIFA’s sponsors voicing their concerns about the recent revelations.
The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,  read a statement from Adidas, FIFA’s longest-serving sponsor.
Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us, but we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the investigatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee.
Encouragingly for FIFA, interest in soccer continues to grow in the U.
The 2010 World Cup set a new benchmark for soccer coverage and viewing numbers in the U.
Although there has been no indication yet that the negative press regarding the Qatar World Cup bid, including the rights of workers’ building the infrastructure around the tournament, has impacted interest, the more long-sighted among FIFA’s members will be well aware of the risk of slowing the growth of the game.
It could be that Blatter, who will be up for re-election next year, likely against Qatar-supporter Michel Platini, could help safeguard both his own future and the reputation of FIFA, especially in the U.
A customer watches a replay of a soccer game at Sony s showroom in Tokyo on Monday.
LONDON RIO, DE JANEIRO – Sponsors Adidas, Sony, Visa and Coca-Cola called on soccer’s rulers Sunday to deal thoroughly with allegations that bribery was used to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar, an issue overshadowing this week’s kickoff in Brazil.
With its showpiece event only four days away, soccer’s governing body FIFA is on the defensive, conducting an internal investigation into the decisions to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 Cup in Qatar.
Qatar’s bid has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the Cup is played and the tiny country’s lack of domestic soccer tradition.
If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European club soccer clubs.
The signs of unease from some of FIFA’s paymasters will raise pressure on the body, led by its 78-year-old Swiss president Sepp Blatter, to get to the bottom of the allegations and tackle underlying concerns about how it is run.
The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,” said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970.
Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us,” a company statement read.
But we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee.
The FIFA World Cup is a platform that unites people all over the world, inspiring and celebrating the world’s most popular sport while creating memorable experiences for athletes and fans.
We believe that through our partnership and continued involvement with FIFA we can help foster optimism and unity, while making a positive difference in the communities we serve.
Michael Garcia, leading FIFA’s internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after this year’s World Cup final.
We are in constant contact with our Commercial Affiliates including Adidas, Sony and Visa and they have 100 percent confidence in the investigation currently being conducted by FIFA’s independent Ethics Committee,” Weil said.
Credit card company Visa, which has a contract as a FIFA sponsor until 2022, said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation.
We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,” it said in a statement.
Sony, Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola are among six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year.
We are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations seriously and that the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee will conduct a thorough investigation.
FIFA has already banned Bin Hammam for life from soccer over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president.
FIFA has suspended German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer for refusing to cooperate with its investigation into allegations of corruption related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.
Michael Garcia, the chief investigator for FIFA’s ethics committee, requested a 90-day ban for Beckenbauer, the Associated Press reports.
The decision was taken pursuant to the FIFA Code of Ethics art.
Code of Ethics appears to have been committed and a decision on the main issue may not be taken early enough,” FIFA said in a statement .
Beckenbauer, 68, was part of the FIFA executive committee that voted to give the World Cup hosting rights to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, BBC reports.
He has since stepped down from the executive committee, but still serves as a special advisor to FIFA.
Earlier this month, a report by the Sunday Times revealed that former FIFA executive Mohamed Bin Hammam bribed top soccer officials with $5 million to secure support for Qatar’s successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
It’s unclear if Beckenbauer’s 90-day ban will prevent him from attending games at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.
In a shocking revelation, The Guardian newspaper reports that Michael Garcia, FIFA’s lead ethics investigator, has opted not to examine documents revealed in The Sunday Times explosive report .
It appears with fresh evidence that could give more clarity to the situation, FIFA is more interested in imposing its own arbitrary deadline than getting to the bottom of the evidence in this matter.
Examination of the new evidence would only delay release of the report by a few weeks but FIFA seems determined to shove the issue under the rug once the 2014 World Cup begins on June 12.
Jim Murphy, the shadow secretary for international development, said: ‘If the Garcia investigation refuses to accept the Sunday Times evidence the process will be a sham and Fifa will be forever tainted.
Meanwhile, Michel Platini, the president of the European football federation, Uefa, is discussing the possibility of leading a sit-down protest when Blatter announces his intention to stand again as Fifa’s president in Brazil next week.
Platini, who is increasingly considered unlikely to challenge Blatter for the top job, may ask the heads of the 54 European FAs to remain seated when the majority of the other 155 Fifa members rise to acclaim the announcement as a means of registering disapproval at Blatter’s decision to stand for a fifth term despite earlier promising to stand down.

But in the end England secured only one vote among the 22 executive committee members apart from that of their own Fifa vice-president, Geoff Thompson.
What is ironic and obvious in this excerpt is that the Prime Minister admits that Prince William, Beckham and him had bought  or attempted to buy  “numerous Fifa members” votes, yet noone dared call him out on it.
Mr Cameron, how did you get “assured by numerous Fifa members of their support”?
Mr Cameron what was your meeting with FIFA members about?
So long as stadiums are being filled and FIFA’s pockets are being lined, then there will be no change.
Host nations get the “honor” of hosting meaning that they get to spend millions of dollars on bribing FIFA officials then millions more to build stadiums and meet FIFA requirements.
Then FIFA gets to take home the majority of profits from the matches they put on.
All of this is just a fact of life and to think that soccer  or sports in general  is somehow above it all, is just being naive.
The former Head of FIFA  Brazilian Havenlage  and his son-in law were found to be involved in some type of corruption too involving pay offs.

FIFA has banned Mongolian Football Federation president Ganbold Buyannemekh from soccer for five years for taking bribes, soccer’s governing body announced Wednesday .
FIFA alleged Buyannemekh accepted payments from bin Hammam prior to FIFA Executive Committee elections in 2009 and the FIFA presidential election in 2011.
Bin Hammam challenged FIFA president Sepp Blatter in 2011 but withdrew his name from contention just days before the election.
He quit all football-related posts in 2012 and received a lifetime ban from the sport from FIFA.
FIFA found Buyannemekh guilty of six violations of the FIFA Code of Ethics: general rules of conduct; duty of disclosure, cooperation and reporting; conflicts of interest; offering and accepting gifts and other benefits; bribery and corruption; and general obligation to collaborate.
The decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively was taken by the FIFA Executive Committee in Zurich in December 2010.

Suspended by FIFA following allegation of fraud during his time at CONCACAF.
Resigned from FIFA in April 2013, citing health reasons, weeks after he was accused of taking bribes from ISL.
The former FIFA president quit his position as honorary president of FIFA on health grounds in 2013, shortly before publication of a FIFA ethics reports into bribes paid by ISL to FIFA officials.
The intrigue enveloping Fifa has deepened with the resignation of Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Brazilian football confederation  CBF  for 22 years and a long-time powerful figure within football s world governing body.
Under pressure in Brazil over the organisation of the 2014 World Cup and at Fifa following a series of corruption allegations, Teixeira s resignation has been predicted for months.
Teixeira s path to football s power-broking was smoothed by the former CBF and Fifa president João Havelange, whose daughter, Lucia, Teixeira married, although they later divorced.
Most immediately in Zurich is the likely publication of a settlement made in court in the Swiss canton of Zug, in connection with alleged bribes paid to senior Fifa officials in the late 1990s by the marketing company ISL.
When FIFA, the organizer of soccer s World Cup, announced in 2010 that Qatar would host the tournament in 2022, the decision was roundly mocked.
Qatar had a tiny population, no history in international soccer, no domestic soccer league, no infrastructure to handle the massive crowds and the summer temperatures routinely above 110 degrees.
British newspapers quickly accused Qatar of using its massive petroleum wealth to bribe FIFA s voters to gain the World Cup.
Four years later, FIFA is on the verge of stripping Qatar of the 2022 World Cup.
Even before the results of FIFA s investigation were announced, Qatari billionaire Mohamed bin Hammam was accused by the Sunday Times Of London of paying millions of dollars in bribes.
A Qatari official stands near the FIFA World Cup trophy following its arrival in Doha.
Five of the six leading sponsors of the World Cup  adidas, Coca-Cola, Hyundai, Sony and Visa  have publicly demanded that FIFA expose and remedy any corruption.
Just yesterday, Jorge Ramos, dean of ESPN s Spanish-language news team covering soccer, tweeted that FIFA had approached U.
Soccer and advised them to have their organizing committee ready in case FIFA withdrew the 2022 World Cup from Qatar.
Soccer has denied that any approach has been made, but the soccer world is abuzz with anticipation.
Millions of emails and other documents revealed that Qatar s bin Hammam set up a multi-million dollar slush fund that made payments into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African soccer federations.
Asian soccer officials received an additional $1.
The investigation also uncovered million-dollar payments to Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice-president who sat on its executive committee.
The World Cup was always held during the summer so that it would not conflict with the European soccer leagues.
There is not a single World Cup sized soccer stadium in Qatar.
One of the ostensible purposes of awarding the World Cup to Qatar was to expand soccer s popularity in Arab and Muslim countries.
It is hard to imagine FIFA wanting to place its premier event into this cauldron.
The evidence of rampant corruption in awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar  and the insurmountable logistical problems with staging a soccer tournament in the summer desert heat   will almost certainly lead to a  re-vote.
Particularly in light of the massive parallel investigations that have commanded headlines around the world, FIFA s investigation will have to acknowledge the massive misconduct.
Soccer governing body FIFA contributed about a quarter of the budget of a newly released movie on its history that avoids corruption issues that tainted the organization in the past four years.
United Passions, which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival last week, features Pulp Fiction actor Tim Roth as FIFA President c while Frenchman Gerard Depardieu plays World Cup creator Jules Rimet.
She said FIFA contributed about a quarter of the film s 23.
Absent from the film are figures including Mohamed bin Hammam, the Qatari ex-head of Asian soccer and a former Blatter ally.
He was expelled after a 15-year stint on the board following claims he tried to bribe voters with envelopes stuffed with cash ahead of his challenge to unseat the FIFA president in 2011.
Our movie is not an investigation about FIFA,  Maurin said.
Our movie is a historic movie about the history of FIFA from birth up until now.
In recent weeks he s said he ll be a candidate again if FIFA s 209 member associations ask him to.
Blatter told a lot of stories about FIFA, and a lot of stories about himself, from when he arrived up until now,  Maurin said.
Roland Buechel, a member of the Swiss parliament who once worked for FIFA s defunct marketing partner ISL, said the movie is an example of Blatter s efforts to raise his profile, speculating it s part of a push to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
The Mirror said the film could be the worst- ever soccer movie.
Blatter, who is Swiss, joined FIFA in the late 1970s as a development officer, before moving on to become its general secretary under Havelange.
Warner, a former FIFA vice president, quit the governing body in 2011 amid a bribery investigation and denied wrongdoing.
We agreed to contribute financially as we considered this to be a unique opportunity to raise awareness of the breadth of FIFA s work to develop football globally, and of the challenges FIFA had to overcome in establishing the FIFA World Cupand turning it into the world s biggest single sporting event,  the organization said in an e-mailed statement.
Producers were given access to FIFA s film archive and were supported by its marketing and press departments as well as the office of general secretary Jerome Valcke, Maurin said.
Ganbold Buyannemekh has been banned for five years by Fifa.
A senior figure in Asian football has been banned for five years for “soliciting and accepting” bribes from the former Fifa executive Mohamed bin Hammam .
Ganbold Buyannemekh, the head of the Mongolian FA and a former member of the Asian Football Confederation’s executive committee, was banned by Fifa’s ethics committee for accepting the payments to back Bin Hammam’s campaign for the Fifa presidency in 2011.
He also accepted money from Bin Hammam when he was involved in an election to Fifa’s executive committee in 2009, narrowly beating Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa – the current AFC president – by 23 votes to 21.
A statement from Fifa said : “The adjudicatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee, chaired by Hans-Joachim Eckert, has decided to ban the president of the Mongolian Football Federation, Ganbold Buyannemekh, from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level for a period of five years.
Mr Buyannemekh solicited and accepted payments  in the context of the elections for the Fifa executive committee at the AFC Congress in 2009 as well as the Fifa presidential election in 2011.
Bin Hammam’s challenge against Sepp Blatter for the Fifa presidency ended weeks before the vote after allegations surfaced of payments to officials in the Caribbean.
He was later banned for life by Fifa’s ethics committee.
That brings us to FIFA, the premier governing body of international football.
Since football is the most popular sport in the world, FIFA basically runs the world.
Countries suspend their laws for FIFA, as South Africa did for the 2010 World Cup ; and FIFA sponsored matches have both incited and stopped wars, as in the cases of The Soccer War between Honduras and El Salvador after 1969 World Cup qualifiers  and the ceasefire between warring parties in the First Ivorian Civil War after the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup .
Having been founded in 1904 , FIFA is younger than many nations, and yet is arguably one of the most influential institutions in the entire world.
However over the years, FIFA has been marred by valid accusations ranging from corruption and money laundering to media suppression and election rigging.
Critics have called out FIFA and its current President Sepp Blatter an immeasurable number of times on these controversies, but as a governing body without official subjects, FIFA needs to answer to no one.
In its mission statement , FIFA describes itself in a good light, but the following satirical comic strips do not give that impression.
Instead, they pinpoint major issues in the way FIFA is run and how it runs football.
Does that mean FIFA is rotten to the core?
Accusations of corruption among FIFA officials have circulated for decades.
Now, they are being confirmed as court systems formally indict high-ranking officials of FIFA with fraud, bribery, or embezzlement.
Earlier in 2013, once a Swiss court ruled that  João Havelange, FIFA’s president from 1974 to 1998, took millions of kickback dollars  from FIFA’s financial partners ,  he resigned from his position as FIFA’s honorary president  .
More specifics about key players in FIFA’s financial mismanagement can be found in  The Dark Side of FIFA: Selected controversies and the future of accountability in the organization .
Piling onto the accusations, former players who are no longer affiliated with FIFA have spoken out against current FIFA president Sepp Blatter and other high-ranking officials as well.
In 2013,  Brazilian congressman and former soccer player Romario called Blatter “a thief” and secretary general Jerome Valcke “a blackmailer”  .
For a more in-depth look into corruption within FIFA, consider viewing  Part 1  and  Part 2  of the documentary FIFA’s Dirty Secrets, created by investigative reporter Andrew Jennings with BBC Panorama.
The first comic below touts that FIFA only chose countries with governments that are equivalently undemocratic and corrupt, which reiterates the corruption within FIFA itself.
Qatar also has anti-gay laws, but considering that FIFA has the power to temporarily override national laws during World Cup  as previously mentioned in the case of 2010 South Africa , FIFA could force Russia and Qatar to temporarily suspend of the anti-gay laws during the World Cups .
Unfortunately, the above comic is a social commentary of the awful irony that Qatari laborers, many whom do not have the ability to leave the country, are working in the deadly heat to build an air-conditioned stadium for FIFA.
However, knowing FIFA’s history, they will likely come up with some excuse or another and delay the decision until it is too late to move the 2022 World Cup from Qatar.
Blatter and FIFA’s role in vote-buying is hazy at best.
In the midst of everything, FIFA has pulled its fair share of Big Brother moments in attempts at silencing its critics.
The public has responded angrily to their restrictions, which has led FIFA to back down a bit.
However with every World Cup, FIFA tries to limit the freedom of journalists.
And each time it tries, FIFA only attracts negative attention towards itself.
FIFA supposedly supports freedom of press, but prior to the 2006 World Cup, the organization placed restrictions on digital publication of photographs during the World Cup and had a clause stating that news organizations “may not bring FIFA into disrepute” .
The comic below represents FIFA’s media restrictions crushing the world’s freedom of press.
The World Association of Newspapers  WAN  finally challenged and convinced FIFA to write in a new clause relating to press freedom in 2009 .
If it were not for WAN pressuring FIFA into a corner, it is doubtful that FIFA would have done anything.
Before the 2010 World Cup, South African journalists questioned FIFA’s press accreditation rules, which included that newspapers could not publish photographs or videos relating to events on their websites and that newspapers could not be sold within a radius of 800 meters around stadiums .
Come Brazil 2014, journalists will likely once again question FIFA’s media regulations, and for good reason.
If they do not push FIFA to change their restrictions, no one will.
Things are not looking so great for FIFA.
Despite the allegations and controversy, FIFA is still the major ruling body of international football and the FIFA World Cup is still one of the most anticipated events in the world.
Regardless of everything, people continue to attend FIFA-sponsored events and FIFA will continue to make millions off its agreements with its sponsors.
With the advent of the Internet and social media, it is becoming increasingly difficult for FIFA to hide behind its false do-good publicity stunts .
People are becoming more and more vocal about the obvious corruption in FIFA, and there is nothing that FIFA can do to quiet them.
The thing is, FIFA does have the ability to be an actual force in change.
It deals with more countries than the United Nations , and these countries are often more responsive to FIFA’s policy changes than to the U.
However, due to the track record of current FIFA officials, it seems that the only way things will change is with the inauguration of a new crop of officials.

In soccer the gears that player used are very important.
For example, the soccer shoes if they use defected shoes the tendency is they could not perform well in the field.
SAO PAULO – Thursday was declared a national holiday here because, well, if the Brazil national team playing in the opener of a Brazilian-hosted World Cup in this soccer-mad country’s largest city isn’t cause to just shut everything down … then what exactly is?
Perhaps only the combination of a corrupt FIFA and desperate politicians who do business with soccer s global governing body are capable of ruining a night that should otherwise have been so ideal.
It’s the FIFA World Cup in Brazil they despise, an impossible-to-ignore boondoggle that’s seen a precious $11 billion spent on unnecessarily opulent  or just unnecessary  construction.
The idea that Brazilians would curse and march against the playing of a soccer game is both unfathomable and the starkest sign yet at the public’s growing disdain for FIFA and its way of doing business.
In short, doing business with the FIFA and IOC, both of which command lopsided contracts, makes little sense to most everyday people.
Meanwhile, FIFA takes all of the global television and local ticket revenue, leaving host countries awash in debt and trying to justify the expense on the benefits of increased global publicity and some tourism.
As soccer grows in popularity around the world and technology brings fans closer together and the action to everyone, FIFA has managed to find a way to squeeze a measure of joy out of the game even among its most passionate fans.
The 2022 FIFA World Cup will be the 22nd FIFA World Cup , an international football tournament that is scheduled to take place in Qatar in 2022.
It will be the first World Cup in the Middle East, and the first Arab country to host the FIFA World Cup, and the first in Asia since 2002 .
On 22 September 2014, Theo Zwanziger , a member of the executive committee of FIFA, stated that he believed the 2022 FIFA World Cup will not be held in Qatar due to scorching heat.
The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.
Initially, eleven bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings,  and Indonesia  s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.
Indonesian officials had not ruled out a bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , until Qatar took the 2022 cup.
In the end, there were five bids for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea and the United States.
The twenty-two member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.
Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.
There have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving members of FIFA s executive committee.
These allegations are being investigated by FIFA.
Qatar is the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup – the next smallest by area is Switzerland, host of the 1954 FIFA World Cup , which is more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of the current 32.
All FIFA member associations , of which there are currently 209,  are eligible to enter qualification.
A Qatar may still qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup .
A report released on 9 December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that other nations could host some matches during the World Cup.
Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA s executive committee.
According to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch ; the investment banking division of Bank of America , the organizers in Qatar have requested from FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs.
The selection of Qatar as the host country has been controversial; FIFA officials were accused of corruption and allowing Qatar to  buy  the World Cup,  the treatment of construction workers was called into question by human rights groups,  and the high costs needed to make the plans reality were criticised.
Four of FIFA s six primary sponsors, Sony , Adidas , Visa and Coca-Cola , have called upon FIFA to investigate the claims.

CNN  -- FIFA has employed a pair of high-profile crimefighters to help tackle corruption in the game, after a wake of scandals that have engulfed soccer s world governing body.
Their first task will be to investigate a Swiss court document after an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner International Sports and Leisure  ISL  to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira.
Last week Blatter admitted that he did know about the alleged bribes handed to former FIFA executives, but insisted he didn t think they were illegal at the time.
As well as the new appointments, Blatter also announced a new FIFA Code of Ethics which includes provision to remove time limitations for the prosecution of bribery and corruption cases.
Kickbacks and cover-ups at FIFA?
A turbulent period for FIFA began in May 2010.
Whilst most of the world s soccer fans were more concerned with Africa s first World Cup finals that June, FIFA was presented with official bid documents by Australia, England, Netherlands Belgium, Japan, South Korea, Qatar, Russia, Spain Portugal and the United States for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.
During the ceremony at its Swiss headquarters, FIFA announced dates for inspections of the bidding nations from July-September.
British newspaper Mail On Sunday reveals that English bid leader David Triesman was secretly recorded making comments about alleged attempts by Spain and Russia to bribe referees at the imminent 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Russia s Prime Minister Vladimir Putin meets the visiting FIFA inspection team in Moscow.
I am confident that my actions, the full and true extent of which were not detailed in the story published, will demonstrate not only my innocence and integrity, but also my commitment to football and to FIFA,  the 57-year-old says in a statement.
It is a sad day for football,  FIFA president Sepp Blatter, pictured here meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron a week earlier, tells reporters in Zurich.
Despite a hi-tech pitch that included state-of-the-art cooling technology to keep players and fans safe, FIFA gave one part of the bid a  high  risk rating.
In the report it stated that hosting the World Cup in June and July would be  considered as a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken .
Issa Hayatou from Cameroon is one of three FIFA officials -- the others Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay and Ricardo Teixeira from Brazil -- who are named in a BBC program which alleges they took bribes from the ISL marketing company who secured World Cup rights in the 1990s.
Football world governing body FIFA says the allegations have already been investigated and the matter is closed.
After months of speculation, Asian Football Confederation chief Mohamed bin Hammam announces he is to stand against Blatter in FIFA s presidential election.
Just a few weeks before FIFA s presidential vote, former FA chairman David Triesman gives evidence at a UK parliamentary enquiry into England s failed 2018 bid.
Under the cover of parliamentary privilege Triesman accused FIFA Ex Co members Warner, Nicholas Leoz, Ricardo Texeira and Worawi Makudi of trying to secure cash and privileges in return for their vote.
In other evidence submitted to the committee from the Sunday Times, it was alleged that FIFA vice-president Issa Hayatou along with fellow Ex Co member Jacques Anouma has been paid $1.
Blatter maintains that the allegations are  without substance , and is subsequently exonerated by FIFA s ethics committee two days later.
But FIFA s ethics committee upholds the complaints against Bin Hammam and Warner.
Despite a last minute attempt by the English FA to postpone the vote - a proposal which garnered just 17 out of the available 208 votes -Sepp Blatter is re-elected for a fourth term as president of FIFA at the 61st FIFA Congress at Hallenstadion in Zurich.
Former head of the Asian Football Confederation Mohamed Bin Hammam was banned for life by FIFA after a two-day hearing into bribery allegations.
I don t see any limitation if anything has happened,  he told a press conference at FIFA s headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, when asked about the ISL case.
What you are mentioning right now, this is a case that has been taken to the Supreme Court in Switzerland, where a decision was taken, so FIFA will now look into only moral and ethical issues.
I remain 100% committed to reforms and FIFA fully backs Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert, the two new independent chairmen.
Meanwhile, Mohamed bin Hammam, a former challenger to Blatter for the FIFA presidency, has been suspended for 30 days over new corruption allegations.
The Qatari was banned from soccer for life after a FIFA probe found him guilty of offering bribes in return for votes during his challenge to Blatter, which he withdrew hours before his ban.

A World Cup in December or January would force a years-long reconfiguration of the soccer calendar.
More recently, Football Federation Australia chairman Frank Lowy asked for over $40 million in compensation from FIFA for its failed 2022 bid, and also damages relating to uprooting the soccer calendar.
Not surprisingly, FIFA denied that request .
Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati, a newly-elected member of FIFA s executive committee, has called for delaying the vote until the entire situation can be fleshed out.
I don’t see at this stage, frankly, how I or any member of FIFA’s executive committee could make a sensible decision,  Gulati told the New York Times .
Just how much influence Fox really has with FIFA isn t clear.
Given FIFA s history of doing whatever it wants, the governing body might not think much of being threatened with one breach-of-contract lawsuit.
But if more TV companies around the world start making the same threat, FIFA might have to pay attention.
The Sunday Times, which last week claimed that the former FIFA Executive Committee member made payments totaling $5 million to senior football officials to seal support for Qatar, also accused Bin Hammam of using $1.
It alleged that Bin Hammam arranged government level talks for Thailand s FIFA executive Worawi Makudi to discuss a gas sale  potentially worth tens of millions of dollars to Thailand   and that he was invited to visit Vladimir Putin before Russia and Qatar s victories in the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
The 2010 vote, which awarded football s biggest tournament to the tiny desert state, is under investigation by FIFA s independent ethics prosecutor.
In a statement released on Saturday following its Executive Committee s second meeting of the year in Sao Paulo, FIFA said   the executive reaffirmed its position of letting the ethics committee complete its work before making any comment.
Global soccer leaders head to Sao Paulo Tuesday for FIFA s annual congress, but the event is being eclipsed by bribery allegations against a former Qatari soccer boss and sponsors  calls for a full investigation.
As soccer s most prominent delegates descended on Sao Paulo Tuesday, FIFA s annual congress was overshadowed by sponsors  unusual frankness over corruption allegations facing Qatar s winning bid to host the games in 2022.
The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,  the German sportswear maker Adidas said.
The mood was also tainted after FIFA president Sepp Blatter lashed out the day before against people he said were  plotting to destroy  soccer s governing body, suggesting racism was behind the bribery claims.
On Monday, two major backers of the World Cup - oil giant BP and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev - joined five of FIFA s biggest commercial partners in calling for an investigation into claims that a former Qatari soccer leader paid millions of dollars in bribes to secure his country s bid.
We expect FIFA to take all necessary steps to address the issue,  Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of sponsor Budweiser beer - known in most of the EU as Bud - said in a statement.
The fact that five of FIFA s official partners - Adidas, Coca-Cola, Visa, Sony and Hyundai - have been so outspoken is rather unusual.
Qatar s 2022 World Cup organizing committee has denied being aware of any  alleged payments by the former head of the country s national soccer association to an ex-vice president of FIFA, soccer s international governing body.
Jack Warner, the former president of North American soccer s governing body CONCACAF and a member of the FIFA committee that chose the 2022 World Cup host.
Both men had left FIFA in 2011 after having been suspended by the organization during investigations into previous bribery allegations.
According to the Telegraph, one of Warner s companies had requested that payment in December 2010, two weeks after a FIFA vote selected Qatar to stage the 2022 tournament ahead of rival bidders the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea.
The 2022 Bid Committee strictly adhered to FIFA s bidding regulations in compliance with their code of ethics,  the committee said in a statement in response to the latest allegations.
It was reported in March 2013 that an FBI probe into corruption in international soccer had recruited Warner s son Daryan as a cooperating witness.
Opting to host the world s largest soccer tournament in a  desert climate  where daytime summer temperatures rarely fall below 104 degrees Fahrenheit has provoked widespread concern among Europe s leading soccer clubs, while human rights groups have drawn attention to  dire working conditions  in Qatar s construction sector.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter previously said soccer s  governing body had made a  bad mistake  over the bid processes for choosing the 2018 and 2022 World Cup venues, which were held simultaneously and led to the suspension of two executive committee members who attempted to sell their votes for cash.
Bin Hammam, the former president of the Asian Football Confederation and a former member of FIFA s executive committee, had challenged Blatter s reelection as president, but days before the 2011 vote the Qatari official was accused of trying to bribe Caribbean officials to vote for him in a plot orchestrated by Warner.
Bin Hammam and Warner both denied wrongdoing, but Warner subsequently quit his FIFA and CONCACAF positions, while Bin Hammam was banned for life from all FIFA and soccer activities.
World soccer s governing body, FIFA, is facing new allegations of corruption over its contentious decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
Britain s  Sunday Times  newspaper recently revealed it had evidence that a Qatari football official spent $5 million in bribes to FIFA officials in exchange for their support for the country s bid to host the event.
As FIFA was launching its own investigation into the bribery claims against Qatar, pressure was mounting to stage a redo of the bidding process and find a new location for the 2022 World Cup.
It’s a path that could lead to the United States as a logical destination, although Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati reaffirmed in an email to the Daily News that he won’t submit another bid until FIFA changes the voting policies that have come under fire since a bombshell report exposed international corruption.
At least one FIFA official said he is on board with a revote for 2022 if, as reported by the London Sunday Times, Qatar won the bid with the assistance of bribe money.
I, certainly, as a member of the executive committee would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a revote,” FIFA vice president Jim Boyce said on BBC Radio.
If  FIFA chief investigator Michael Garcia  comes up with concrete evidence and concrete evidence is given to the executive committee and to FIFA, then it has to be looked at very seriously.
The FIFA executive committee are 100%.
According to the Daily Telegraph in the UK, Frenchman Michel Platini, the former president of European soccer’s governing body, held a secret meeting with Mohamed Bin Hammam, the Qatari at the heart of the bribery accusations, just before Platini voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.

WASHINGTON  Reuters  - An FBI probe into alleged corruption in international soccer has recently intensified after investigators persuaded a key party to be a cooperating witness, U.
They said that the witness is Daryan Warner, the son of former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner.
The deepening of the probe indicates that a succession of corruption scandals involving FIFA and other international soccer bodies in the past few years may continue to cast a cloud over the sport for some time.
Jack Warner was formerly head of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football  CONCACAF , as well as previously being one of a number of vice-presidents of FIFA, soccer s global governing body.
Jack Warner quit his FIFA and CONCACAF positions in June 2011 in the wake of allegations of bribery in a report by a lawyer commissioned by Blazer, a member of FIFA s executive committee and former general secretary of CONCACAF.
The report alleged that Warner collaborated with another FIFA vice president at the time, Mohamed Bin Hammam of Qatar, to bribe Caribbean soccer officials so that they would back a bid by Bin Hammam to become FIFA s president.
When Warner resigned his FIFA position, the organization declared that  the presumption of innocence is maintained  in his case.
Bin Hamman was banned for life from all FIFA and soccer activities in 2011 for trying to bribe soccer officials in the Caribbean in the run-up to the election.
The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote Rigging and Ticket Scandals,  said he has had several meetings with FBI investigators working on the case and provided the FBI and IRS with what Jennings describes as confidential documents he obtained related to payments from soccer organization funds to offshore bank accounts.
In an email, FIFA s media department said the Swiss-based organization was  unaware  of any FBI investigation related to the Americas and Caribbean.
The New York-based FBI squad which is conducting the soccer investigation is a squad that specializes in  Eurasian Organized Crime.
The soccer association FIFA is involved, and the case in Switzerland will expose a system of bribes -- and perhaps those who accepted them.
For Joseph Blatter, the world football association FIFA is an outfit that unites the planet, an organization in which values like decency, morality and mutual respect hold sway.
Batter is Swiss, and he s led the association of 208 national clubs  or 260 million soccer players  since 1998.
Blatter views FIFA as a complex, ethical work of art -- somewhere between the United Nations and Amnesty International, one that long ago should have won a Nobel Peace Prize.
But there s also another view of the organization, one that paints FIFA as a global money-printing machine, raking in hundreds of million Swiss francs a year, with revenues of more than 3 billion Swiss francs between 2003 and 2006 alone.
Just under a year ago Blatter dedicated FIFA s new headquarters in Zurich, which cost 240 million francs.
Since his election 10 years ago, Blatter has had to defend himself against the charge that FIFA can be bought.
But now Swiss investigators have found that sports officials, including representatives of FIFA, may have taken bribes numbering in the millions.
Not only did the company guarantee FIFA a payment of at least 2.
Hildbrand s business trips also took him to Liechtenstein, where he discovered transactions that prosecutors believe ISMM used to bribe sports officials.

ZURICH, Switzerland -- FIFA has banned the Mongolian football federation president from soccer for five years for taking bribes from Mohamed bin Hammam ahead of the FIFA presidential election.
Bin Hammam withdrew his bid to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency in 2011 just days before the election after allegations he offered bribes.
Bin Hammam, who has always denied wrongdoing, resigned from all football-related posts in 2012 and received a new lifetime ban from FIFA.
FIFA says Buyannemekh took payments from Bin Hammam  in the context of the elections  of the Qatari s election to the FIFA executive committee in 2009 and then the presidential election two years later.

Did bribes have anything to do with FIFA s choice to give the 2022 World Cup to Qatar?
Qatar four years ago to host the 2022 World Cup soccer championship, it seemed an odd choice.
The tiny oil-rich emirate has neither a history of nor the infrastructure for top-level soccer, and the summertime matches would be played in life-threatening triple-digit heat.
On the other hand, FIFA s decision meant that for the first time, a Middle Eastern country would host the world s largest sporting event, an important milestone for the quadrennial tournament.
Australia and other larger nations: some $5 million in alleged bribes to secure FIFA site-committee votes.
The key figure in the scandal, the report said, is Mohamed bin Hammam, a former Qatari soccer official and FIFA vice president.
FIFA has already banned Hammam over unrelated conflicts of interest, and a ban even before that — related to allegations that he tried to bribe his way into the FIFA presidency — was voided on appeal.
But FIFA s problems run deeper than Qatar.
According to an internal FIFA report obtained by the New York Times, a Singapore-based gambling ring tried to rig as many as 15 international scrimmages before the 2010 World Cup in South Africa — a scandal FIFA has allegedly kept under wraps.
If governing votes can be bought and if matches can be rigged, then FIFA s core credibility is in doubt.
A full investigation into FIFA s governance and management should be undertaken by disinterested outsiders, seeking an open accounting of what has occurred — and a blueprint for how FIFA could be reformed.
A senior Fifa official and his family were paid almost $2 million  £1.
Jack Warner, the former vice-president of Fifa, appears to have been    personally paid $1.
It is understood that the FBI is now investigating Trinidad-based Mr Warner    and his alleged links to the Qatari bid, and that the former Fifa official’s    eldest son, who lives in Miami, has been helping the inquiry as a    co-operating witness.
Although Qatar has repeatedly denied wrongdoing during the bidding process, it    has long been suspected that the decision was flawed, and several members of    the Fifa committee have faced corruption allegations.
It can be disclosed that a company owned by Mohamed Bin Hammam, the Fifa    executive member for Qatar, appeared to pay $1.
Michael Garcia, the joint chief investigator of Fifa’s ethics committee, is    also investigating irregularities surrounding the bidding process.
The disclosures will add to concerns that some Fifa executive committee    members were not impartial when they cast their votes in December 2010.
The former Fifa employee later    withdrew the allegations.
Lord Triesman, the bid’s former chairman, gave evidence stating    that four Fifa executive committee members had asked for business deals and    favours when negotiating their support.
The Labour peer said that the then Fifa vice-president had asked for money to    build an education centre in Trinidad, with the cash to be channelled    through him, and £500,000 to buy World Cup television rights for Haiti.
In June 2011, Mr Warner resigned from all football posts after he was accused    of facilitating bribes to members of the Caribbean football union on behalf    of Mohamed Bin Hammam, who was standing against Sepp Blatter to be Fifa    president.
A report by the Fifa ethics committee found that there was “compelling” evidence that Mr Warner was “an accessory to corruption”.
Mr Warner was caught on tape apparently urging fellow Fifa officials to accept    cash gifts from Mr Bin Hammam, the disgraced former presidential candidate.
Regarding the payments to Daryan, the email states that he was “contracted … based on his understanding, contacts and history with the regional players    who make up an integral part of the defence team … pursuant to Fifa bribery    allegations.
A spokesman for Qatar’s 2022    World Cup organising committee said: “The 2022 bid committee strictly    adhered to Fifa’s bidding regulations in compliance with their code of    ethics.
The series of scandals have not only tainted FIFA, but undermined trust in the game as well.
Does FIFA’s corruption hurt the beautiful game?
FIFA, international soccer’s governing body, is corrupt.
While Sepp Blatter, FIFA’s president since 1998, has escaped punishment—so far, at least—many of his colleagues have fallen or resigned.
In 2006, FIFA’s Ethics Committee censured Warner after an audit revealed he made at least $1 million illegally selling World Cup tickets.
The 97-year-old, who served as president prior to Blatter, resigned from FIFA and the International Olympic Committee just before both organizations planned to take disciplinary action against him.
Selling the rights to the World Cup, which brings in nearly 90 percent of FIFA’s revenue, becomes a bigger business each quadrennial.
Even the presumption of unethical activity undermines confidence that real change will come to FIFA.
And with reason: efforts to overhaul FIFA’s leadership structures and introduce genuine reforms continue to stall.
In April, Alexandra Wrage, the chair of the anti-corruption body Trace International, resigned from FIFA’s Independent Governance Committee  IGC  after noting her frustration that the panel, set up in 2011 to encourage transparency, had little to no impact.
IGC head Mark Pieth stayed on, and while he continues to advocate for FIFA to make salaries public, no one expects that to happen.
Second, corruption at the highest levels of FIFA reduces the incentive to deal with problems on the field that affect fan experience, namely racism on the pitch and match-fixing.
While FIFA created the Task Force Against Racism and Discrimination and even approved stiffer penalties for offenders, the leaders of the sport simply lack the moral authority to make deeper change, such as systemicly weeding out of racism on a club-by-club basis.
Those who think FIFA’s current scandals will be forgotten in a few years should look no further than the cautionary tale of Major League Baseball.
Similarly, any time the calls in a FIFA match seem overtly tilted to favor one side over another, it will trigger suspicion of foul play.
The details of MLB and FIFA’s transgressions are different, but the lesson is the same: break the public trust at your own risk.
There is no hope of cleaning up FIFA until Blatter is no longer president.
The best-case scenario is that FIFA will take baby steps toward resolving the problems that lie below the surface.
Every fan should be concerned that FIFA’s rotten core may have permanently stained the beautiful game.
Award-winning reporter Andrew Jennings has led the way investigating corruption in world football  Daily Mail  A meticulously researched and detailed dossier into the inner workings of FIFA  Sunday Business Post  In Foul!
There is no doubt that Andrew Jennings did his research and has solid contacts inside FIFA, that lead to him writing his book Foul.
On the other hand, because of FIFA s lack of transparency, there may be no other way to prove some of the points.
This book is what I see as an almost continuation of another book called  Badfellas  FIFA Family at War.
It take over where it left off with the election of Blatter and a continuation of the research done discovering all the atrocities of soccer s governing body.

Aside from wondering which national team will be crowned champion, for astute soccer fans the burning question of the upcoming 2014 World Cup is not can matches be fixed by gamblers, but will they be?
To aid in this program, FIFA instituted a hotline for players, team officials and referees to report  suspicious activity  anonymously.
Launched in July 2007, the EWS, according to FIFA s website ,  monitors betting on all FIFA matches and competitions in order to prevent negative influences from betting.
Staffed by dedicated personnel in Zurich, the EWS monitors every single FIFA-sanctioned match, searching for unusual movements within the odds and betting that may signal a fix is in progress.
Ralf Mutschke, FIFA s head of security and a former INTERPOL executive, told the BBC that FIFA has already circled certain World Cup matches that they feel may become suspect.
Here in the United States, Las Vegas will see a healthy amount of soccer wagering as well.
Kornegay added that during the tournament, soccer betting likely will outpace the wagers placed on MLB games  a few times over.
In general, FIFA has maintained an ambivalent view toward fans gambling upon their sport.
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa -- where warm-up matches undoubtedly were fixed  perhaps with the aid of South African soccer officials  -- FIFA allowed bookmakers to set up shop right outside the event venues.
The primary area of concern for Mutschke and the rest of FIFA isn t the legal gambling; it s what they cannot monitor or control: the vast, illegal gambling market in Asia.
No one can say with any certainty how much money is being wagered there on soccer matches, but estimates for this World Cup run as high as $1 billion in wagers per match.
FIFA and law enforcement touted the recent round-up in Singapore of 18 people, alleged to be part of a multi-million dollar illegal soccer betting ring, and $1.
According to law enforcement officials, this soccer gambling ring booked over $6 million in bets in the course of just two weeks.
In February 2012, FIFPro, the worldwide union of professional soccer players, released the results of a survey of thousands of its members from Eastern and Southern Europe.
Few soccer fans realize that athletes don t necessarily get paid to play in the World Cup.
Of course, given the state of corruption within FIFA, what is supposed to happen often differs greatly from what does happen, nationalism be damned.
With the proper bribe, the wise fixer can profit easily from this disparity.
While FIFA s security division will be in Brazil, ready to meet with each player, team official and referee as they step off the plane, there is one dark corner that remains unexplored.
That resides within each respective country s national soccer federation.
For the World Cup, allegations of nations fixing the outcomes of soccer matches -- including the championship game itself -- are not unheard of.
One person adding fuel to what most may chalk up as  conspiracy talk  is perhaps the most surprising: former FIFA president Joao Havelange.
Led by soccer legend Pele, the Brazilian team appeared unstoppable, winning both the 1962 and 1970 World Cups.
As Havelange pointed out,  In the three matches that the Brazilian national team played in 1966, of the three referees and six linesmen, seven were British and two were Germans … Brazil went out, Pele  exited  through injury, and England and Germany entered into the final, just as the Englishman Sir Stanley Rous, who was the President of FIFA at the time, had wanted.
More concerned with the rebelliousness of its citizenry than soccer, Peru s president Francisco Bermudez struck a deal with Videla.
Despite a protest from Algeria, whose national team wound up on the outside looking in thanks to the fix, FIFA allowed the result to stand.
Then, just prior to the last World Cup, Lord Triesman, who was the head of the English Football Association, resigned his post after a recording surfaced of him speaking about how Spanish football authorities were attempting to bribe referees in the upcoming tournament.

The president of FIFA, arguably the globe’s most important sporting body, had just made an announcement that would disappoint, among others, Prince William, David Beckham, Morgan Freeman and Bill Clinton.
Every one them had pressured, schmoozed and lobbied FIFA’s 24-member executive committee to select their countries as host of soccer’s World Cup.
Summer temperatures can climb to 120 degrees, which FIFA inspectors called a “potential health risk.
The paper said it had obtained and reviewed millions of documents that allegedly show how former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar — who was banned from soccer for life in 2011 for attempted bribery — bought the World Cup.
According to the report, bin Hammam funneled $5 million to soccer officials so they would support Qatar’s bid in a sprawling act of corruption that spanned the globe, but focused primarily on Africa.
It, too, took a swing  at FIFA on Sunday.
The paper got hold of an internal FIFA investigative report that allegedly showed how match fixing had corrupted South Africa’s World Cup in 2010.
But in some ways, the recent revelations of FIFA’s allegedly corrupt selection process shine a harsher light on it than any international sporting scandal before.
In the days after the report’s release, FIFA did some backpedaling.
I certainly as a member of the executive co would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a re-vote,” FIFA Vice President Jim Boyce  said .
The former British director of public prosecutions had this assessment of FIFA: It’s “ a bit of a cesspit .
World soccer body FIFA has opened an investigation into potential wrongdoing in Qatar s successful but controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
As has been publicly announced, certain allegations regarding events surrounding the bidding for the World Cup 2018 and 2022 were referred to the ethics committee by FIFA following media reports.
We intend to conduct a thorough review of those allegations, including the evidentiary basis for and credibility of any allegations of individual misconduct,  said FIFA ethic investigator Michael J.
Nevertheless, with a proven track record of not wanting to rock the boat or truly tackle fundamental governance issues, FIFA is likely to ensure that the investigation, which will also look at Russia s winning of the right to host the 2018 tournament, will not result in either country being deprived of the honor.
The investigation will however have to further address the worst albeit politically loaded corruption scandal in the history of world soccer in which the bids are inextricably meshed.
The investigation follows more than a year of legal and political battle that late last year led to the final demise of Mohammed Bin Hammam, the highest placed Qatari national who was ultimately stripped of his membership in FIFA s executive council as well as his presidency of the Asian Football Confederation  AFC  and banned for life by FIFA from involvement in soccer.
And to be fair, much of the Qatari efforts, including funding facilities in home countries of FIFA executive committee members and friendlies of some of their national teams, do not violate the world soccer body s bid rules, but raise questions about the integrity of those guidelines.
While it seems strange that the highest Qatari soccer official in world soccer who enjoyed the backing of Qatari emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani at least until he announced that he would challenge FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the group s presidential election, that may be true for the final phase of the Qatari bid.
Bin Hammam is believed to have felt that an almost simultaneous Qatari winning of World Cup hosting rights and the FIFA presidency may have been too much for world soccer to stomach.
While FIFA may steer clear of a renewed look at Mr.
Bin Hammam s dealings by pressuring him late last year to give up his fight to maintain his position in world soccer.
Bin Hammam s banning by FIFA coincided with his resignation from his posts in FIFA and the AFC.
Nonetheless, the FIFA inquiry makes Qatar more vulnerable to criticism of its hosting of the world s largest sporting tournament, including the rights and working conditions of the country s foreign labor force, who constitute a majority of the population as well as human rights following the sentencing to life in prison in November of a poet for a poem that was critical of Sheikh Hamad and the royal family.

World soccer s governing body has been besieged with allegations of corruption.
They re ugly and getting uglier, judging by the scandal brewing at FIFA, the sport s global governing body.

Shortly afterwards, he was suspended from FIFA s executive committee, along with veteran member Jack Warner, pending a bribery inquiry.
More than a third of FIFA s executive committee has been accused of one form of skullduggery or another in the recent past.
FIFA s decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a tiny desert nation some says is ill-suited to soccer -with its rowdy, boozy fans - has aroused particular suspicion.
Two of FIFA s largest sponsors, Coca-Cola and Adidas, have expressed concern about FIFA s feuding.
There s no crisis, he said yesterday, just some difficulties that can be settled within the FIFA family.
Qatar 2022 and Bin Hammam have always strenuously denied the former Fifa vice-president actively lobbied on their behalf in the run-up to the vote in December 2010.
Although the vast majority of the officials did not have a vote, the Sunday Times alleges Bin Hammam s strategy was to win a groundswell of support for the Qatari bid which would then influence the four African Fifa executive committee members who were able to take part in the election.
The Sunday Times also alleges that it has documents which prove Bin Hammam paid 305,000 Euros  £250,000  to cover the legal expenses of another former Fifa executive committee member from Oceania, Reynald Temarii.
The allegations centred around bids to buy votes in the Fifa presidential election of that year.
In March 2014, the Daily Telegraph reported a company owned by Bin Hammam had paid former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner and his family more than £1m.
Temarii, from Tahiti, was unable to vote in the contest as he had already been suspended by Fifa after he was caught out by a Sunday Times sting asking bogus American bid officials for money in return for his support.
But the paper now alleges that Bin Hammam provided him with financial assistance to allow him to appeal against the Fifa suspension, delaying his removal from the executive committee and blocking his deputy David Chung from voting in the 2022 election.
The paper also makes fresh allegations about the relationship between Bin Hammam and his disgraced Fifa ally Jack Warner, from Trinidad.
Although Warner was forced to resign as a Fifa vice-president in 2011, after it was proved he helped Bin Hammam bribe Caribbean football officials in return for their support in his bid to oust the long-standing Fifa president Sepp Blatter, the paper says it has evidence which shows more than $1.
The new allegations will place Fifa  under fresh pressure to re-run the vote for the 2022 World Cup, which was held in conjunction with the vote for the 2018 tournament, in which England were eliminated in the first round with just two votes.
Even in soccer-loving Brazil, citizens rail against FIFA and ask why desperately-needed resources are going to the tournament.
The match would have remained an obscure result in one of soccer s most obscure backwaters, watched by just 442 people at the Sham Shui Po Sports Ground, had it not been revealed that there was something far more sinister than Happy Valley s ineptitude at work.
Earlier this month five soccer players were arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from gambling syndicates to throw the match.
China has missed out on this summer s World Cup in South Africa, plummeted down the FIFA world ranking and, even worse, the state-run Chinese Super League  CSL  is experiencing its own corruption scandal that has spread to Hong Kong.
Two CSL clubs, Guangzhou and Chengdu were relegated from the top division for match fixing, postponing the start of the soccer season.
It was really, really shocking news in China, not just in sports but with everyone, especially when the soccer chief had to step down from the position,  Tang Yue, a sports journalist for the government-run China Daily, told CNN.
Sepp Blatter, the president of football s governing body FIFA, was so keen to shore up support for the game that when China hosted the 2004 Asian Cup Blatter flew in for the final and controversially declared that it was the Chinese, and not the English, that had invented soccer.
You cannot deny the history that in China there is a recollection and evidence  they played the game a thousand years ago,  Blatter told a soccer expo in Beijing, giving FIFA s official seal to claims that the ancient sport of  cuju  was the great-grandfather of the modern game.
The CSL was already the third attempt at setting up the league because the other two collapsed due to corruption and fan violence,  Rowan Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts, a recent book about soccer in China, told CNN.
They are 85th in FIFA s world rankings with a population of over a billion people.
A replacement has been found in the shape of Wei Di, who was in charge of China s water sports federation and who has no previous experience in soccer.
He has said he wants to improve soccer in China.
FIFA rules seek to protect soccer officials from government interference.
Chad, Kenya, Iraq and Iran have all faced suspension after FIFA claimed they suffered from such meddling.
But as Simons points out, whether the Chinese national team makes it to the 2014 finals in Brazil depends largely on their ability to keep soccer clean locally.
On December 2, 2010, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stood before a giant blue screen at his organization’s headquarters in Zurich and announced the two countries that had won the rights to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
After hours of presentations and last-ditch lobbying efforts from Prince William, David Beckham, Morgan Freeman, and Bill Clinton, FIFA’s 24-man executive committee — down to 22 after two members were caught trying to sell their votes to undercover journalists — had elected Russia and Qatar to follow Brazil as the next hosts of soccer’s biggest tournament.
Qatar got so hot in the summer that the inspectors deemed a World Cup there a “potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators.
Nevertheless, Blatter, a winking, bald-pated 75-year-old from FIFA’s home country of Switzerland, looked overjoyed as he read out the results.
They each claimed that the money would be used for development projects — a soccer academy in Auckland, New Zealand, four artificial fields in Nigeria — but wanted the money to be paid to them directly.
Three days before the vote, the BBC’s Panorama program broadcast an investigation into FIFA corruption that accused three current ExCo members of taking bribes in the 1990s.
Multiple newspapers reported that the delegates from CONCACAF, the governing body of North American soccer, had voted against the country from their own confederation, the United States.
In 2006, Jack Warner, the head of CONCACAF, was censured by FIFA’s Ethics Committee when an Ernst & Young audit found that he’d made a million-dollar profit selling World Cup tickets in Trinidad.
None of this had ever really fazed FIFA.
His third term as president was up in June, and he faced an unexpected challenger in the election: Mohammed bin Hammam, the Qatari head of the Asian soccer confederation and a key mover behind Qatar’s successful World Cup bid.
By May 22, when the allegations followed Blatter on a trip to South Africa, the normally merry president was reduced to pounding his hand on a table and exhorting journalists to “stop please to say FIFA is corrupt.
Three days later, however, under pressure from bin Hammam, FIFA surprised the soccer world by launching a major corruption investigation.
On May 29, bin Hammam was suspended from FIFA.
Should it matter to soccer fans if FIFA is corrupt?
It’s easy to see FIFA as unimportant in part because, as the Blatter-bin Hammam wrangle illustrates, there’s something deeply silly about many of the organization’s Machiavellian twists.
One of the common misconceptions about FIFA corruption is that it flourishes because the organization is rolling in money.
In fact, if FIFA were a corporation, its revenue of just more than $1 billion a year wouldn’t get it within a Tim Howard goal kick of the Fortune 500.
Blockbuster Video, the 500th company on the list, had revenues more than four times the average for world soccer’s governing body.
By the global scale on which it operates, FIFA is at best a medium-sized outfit.
Should it matter to soccer fans if FIFA is corrupt?
As a result, the FIFA corruption stories that become public — and there are presumably many that don’t — tend to be silly, tawdry, or decadent rather than chilling or deeply outrageous.
In May 2010, Triesman was ousted from both roles after a former aide secretly taped him saying that Spain and Russia were trying to bribe World Cup referees.
Triesman thus had the perfect stage from which to take revenge on FIFA.
Best of all was Triesman’s meeting with Nicolás Leoz, the six-term president of the South American soccer confederation.
Triesman’s portrait of FIFA as a rogues’ gallery of parasites accorded deeply with what everyone already sensed about the organization.
On the other hand, his portrait of himself as a lion of British rectitude, shocked and outraged by each hint of impropriety, was so absurdly implausible that even if Triesman’s accusations against FIFA weren’t true, FIFA could still be regarded with suspicion simply for consorting with men like Triesman.
The pivotal moment in the history of FIFA corruption came in the summer of 1974.
That year, West Germany upset Johan Cruyff’s Netherlands at the World Cup; the Jules Rimet trophy, which was actually held by the winners, was retired in favor of the FIFA World Cup trophy, which was awarded only in replica; and João Havelange, the tall, grim-faced head of the Brazilian Sports Confederation, was elected as FIFA’s seventh president.
Under Havelange’s predecessor, the Englishman Sir Stanley Rous, FIFA was not notably corrupt, only racist and Eurocentric.
As president, he alienated FIFA’s non-European contingent by resisting efforts to expand the World Cup — in the 1966 tournament, there was one spot reserved for Asia and Africa combined — and by supporting apartheid South Africa’s right to a place in world soccer.
Rous’ FIFA was hopelessly outmoded, an artifact of the game’s colonialist past.
João Havelange had two insights that, taken together, transformed and modernized FIFA.
Havelange toured Africa with the immensely popular Brazilian national team, promised development funds to smaller nations, and lavished attention on regions that had previously been crowded out by traditional soccer giants.
Havelange’s second insight was that the commercial potential of soccer had barely begun to be tapped.
The 1970 World Cup, the first to be broadcast live and in color throughout the developed world, hinted at spectacular possibilities, but Rous’ antique FIFA had done little to exploit them.
Third, FIFA would have total control over all forms of TV rights, advertising, stadium space, etc.
Fourth, FIFA itself would not handle the details of the sponsorship and TV deals.
To cover the last part, the selling of TV rights and sponsorships, Dassler created a marketing company called ISL, short for International Sports and Leisure, and established an office across the street from FIFA headquarters in Zurich.
The combined effect of Havelange’s two insights was to covert FIFA into a sort of hydraulic cash-flow machine.
The money flowed into ISL, which paid FIFA a fixed fee for the rights.
To enjoy exclusive access to the rights, ISL also made off-the-books payments worth tens of millions of dollars to FIFA executives.
To preserve the power structure, FIFA ExCo members funneled resources — and ISL money — to the regional confederations that supported them.
Havelange reigned at FIFA for 24 years and kept the machine working through sheer grandiose force of personality.
When he announced his retirement in 1998, the race to succeed him pitted Lennart Johansson, the Swedish president of UEFA, against the oleaginous Blatter, who was then FIFA’s secretary general.
It’s possible, amazingly, that the worst behavior of the Havelange and Blatter eras was neither illegal nor expressly proscribed by FIFA policy.
Which raises the question again: If FIFA corruption is simply a closed system, detached from reality, a mechanism for assigning World Cup sponsorship rights, and none of the actions it entails are illegal, then where’s the harm?
So as long as the games are good, why does it matter if FIFA is corrupt?
Lefika was co-owned by Bobby Motaung, the heir of the South African soccer dynasty that also controls the powerful Kaizer Chiefs team; its CEO, Chris Grib, had fled the country in 2008 after being implicated in a tax-evasion case.
The past four World Cups to be awarded, representing 16 years of FIFA’s work and tens of billions of dollars in revenue, have charted a line straight down the Democracy Index, from South Africa  30th place  to Brazil  47th  to Russia  107th  to Qatar  137th , where political power is hereditary and homosexuality is a crime.
FIFA corruption matters, in other words, not because the integrity of the ExCo makes much difference to the average American or European fan, but because FIFA isn’t a closed system.
For all that they act like minor Dickens villains, FIFA executives are not sequestered in a novel; they impact the real world.
Brazil 2014 will be a comprehensive spectacle, soccer’s triumphant return to the country where Nike thinks it began, and the fireworks displays will drop showers of money on FIFA.
He was named in both Lord Triesman’s testimony and the BBC Panorama investigation as one of the corrupt eminences of the ExCo, a charge to which he responded, with characteristic subtlety, by vowing to make English soccer’s life “hell” as long as he sat on the committee.
There are signs that the old Havelange coalition is starting to break apart, that Blatter’s grip on FIFA is weakening.
Bin Hammam turned on him; proposed changes to Swiss law might threaten FIFA’s tax status; the press is forever getting closer to the box of dirty secrets.
The domestic clubs, who increasingly hold the real power in soccer, are correspondingly restless; Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the great German striker who now heads the European Clubs Forum, has said that “I don’t accept any longer that we should be guided by people who are not serious and clean.
Havelange, now 95, is being investigated by the International Olympic Committee for accepting a seven-figure bribe.
If nothing else, the average age of the ExCo is 64 — surely one of the main reasons FIFA broke its own tradition by awarding two World Cups at once last year.
But Blatter has withstood crises before, including the sudden collapse of ISL in 2001, which revealed yawning holes in FIFA’s books.
This may be because he understands better than anyone, Havelange included, that while FIFA might influence the real world, it is never finally judged there.
The bribe-takers unsurprisingly appear to have included both Nicolás Leoz, he of the many knighthoods, and Ricardo Teixeira.
The FIFA headquarters in Zurich.
A World Cup fiasco: FIFA gets a red card Add to .
The Swiss-based International Association Football Federation, known by its French initials FIFA, is under siege as it grapples with mounting allegations of bribery and corruption that span the globe and involve millions of dollars.
Over the past decade, allegations that FIFA officials have taken or given bribes or kickbacks have prompted a list of senior soccer figures to resign or be forced out.
And a high-profile FIFA investigation is under way into allegations that FIFA officials were paid millions of dollars to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, something Qatari bid officials deny.
Prominent figures inside and outside FIFA have said it is time to take the drastic step of throwing out what they say was a tainted vote that gave Qatar the tournament and hold another ballot.
Among them is Alexandra Wrage, a Canadian lawyer and internationally respected anti-corruption expert who last year walked away from her seat on the FIFA governance committee overseeing the soccer body’s cleanup efforts because she believed FIFA, and its powerful president Sepp Blatter, weren’t serious about real changes.
I can’t find anybody outside FIFA headquarters that has any confidence in this decision.
The mess at FIFA, which expects to rake in $4.
But until recently, FIFA – a sprawling global body composed of more than 200 national soccer associations – had done little to keep pace.
Indeed, hands-off Switzerland, where FIFA has its imposing angled-glass headquarters in Zurich, had no legislation covering “private sector” bribery until 2006.
In 2012, recurring scandals over alleged kickbacks and bribery during the past decade finally prompted the appointment of a committee to recommend, and then oversee, governance reforms at FIFA.
And despite Canada’s indifference to its own national soccer team – currently ranked an abysmal 110th in the world – two well-regarded Canadian anti-corruption experts were appointed to the 13-member panel: Ms.
Other seats were taken up by external experts and by prominent soccer figures from around the world.
Klotz, who had never seen a professional soccer game, and Ms.
Wrage, who admits she prefers hockey, joined the committee’s other members in recommending a sweeping set of changes for FIFA’s structure and procedures that are designed to remove the temptations for bribery.
FIFA did adopt two key recommendations, naming former New York district attorney Michael Garcia as an independent investigator to look into allegations of bribery, and appointing a German judge and former organized crime prosecutor, Hans-Joachim Eckert, as the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA’s ethics committee.
Klotz describes the two appointees as “tough-as-nails,” and praises FIFA for taking the steps to investigate the allegations.
It’s really a litmus test almost for FIFA, moving forward,” he said.
Back in March, reports emerged that at a meeting of FIFA’s powerful executive committee, some members wanted to fire him or block his investigation.
This, and the experiences that led her to quit the FIFA governance committee panel last year, have made Ms.
Wrage a skeptic: “It has always been a tactic of FIFA to try to ride these scandals out.
She quit last year, she said, after it became clear to her that FIFA was going to “cherry pick” from the committee’s recommendations.
Pieth’s report says she left due to “time constraints,” she says the full reason is that the fighting necessary to bring about real change at FIFA would simply take more time than she had.
At one point during her tenure, a “senior FIFA executive,” whom she would not identify, told her that her committee needed to stop suggesting women for appointments to various FIFA posts: “I looked up and I said, ‘Did you really just say that to me?
FIFA also watered down a recommendation for “integrity checks,” police background checks to weed out organized crime links and screening procedures to ensure FIFA executives were not linked to companies that do business with the soccer body.
FIFA’s checks will instead be conducted by its regional soccer confederations, not by its head office.
However, a proposal to bring in age and term limits is on the agenda for delegates from those member associations when FIFA’s congress meets on Wednesday in a Sao Paulo hotel, the day before Brazil takes the pitch against Croatia for the World Cup’s opening match.
Blatter’s long-term goal will be the result,” she said, recounting that he once told her matter-of-factly that in his powerful post at the top of FIFA, he can hop on a plane to any country in the world and be received by the head to state when he lands.
The man at the centre of the most recent bribery storm, Doha-born Mohamed bin Hammam, 65, has a long history as a senior power figure on FIFA’s executive.
Blatter for the presidency – even promising to clean up corruption – but withdrew just before he was suspended for allegedly offering $1-million in bribes to Caribbean soccer officials to vote for him.
He later resigned after a FIFA probe found he had violated conflict-of-interest rules.
Now, he faces allegations that he paid $5-million in cash or lavish gifts to senior FIFA officials in order to secure the World Cup for Qatar.
One of the changes FIFA has approved in the wake of the recent allegations is the removal of the body’s top brass from the final decision on who hosts the World Cup.
For the 2026 World Cup bidding process, the entire 209-member FIFA congress will vote to decide the winner, taking the decision out of the hands of the elite 25-member executive and presumably making it much more difficult to win by making bribes.
Recently, Canadian soccer officials – apparently unfazed by the storm of bribery allegations – announced their intention to prepare a bid on the 2026 World Cup, hoping to build on a successful women’s event going ahead here next year.
Victor Montagliani, president of the Canadian Soccer Association and a delegate to FIFA’s congress this week, said the changes FIFA has made have already improved the process.
Montagliani said, adding that the officials implicated in previous scandals who were part of the regional soccer federation in which Canada is a member were thrown out.
But he did say that FIFA member associations would find it difficult not to vote to remove the tournament from Qatar if confronted with “hard evidence.
Klotz, the Toronto lawyer who recently finished his work on FIFA’s governance committee, says FIFA deserves credit for what it has done.
Whether FIFA can achieve this, he said, remains to be seen.
Wrage says that unless Swiss authorities decide to pursue FIFA, the only way the organization will change is if the multinational companies that sponsor the World Cup decide to withhold their millions.
If the sponsors are going to keep paying, and the fans are going to keep attending the games, it does make some sense of FIFA’s sense of perfect impunity.
This is not new; from the moment Qatar was named the 2022 World Cup hosts, allegations have been made that FIFA committee members had accepted millions of dollars in bribes to make it happen.

But he admitted that all of the scandal surrounding FIFA has somewhat tempered his enthusiasm.
In fact, telling someone about the inner workings of FIFA for the first time is a bit like showing someone ‘Two Girls One Cup.
From there, John Oliver ranted about FIFA’s various illicit practices.
For starters, while Brazil spent billions of dollars to host the 2014 World Cup, much of the money made from the tournament will go back to FIFA, not the nation’s government.
Brazil, let me put this in terms you might understand,” John Oliver continued during his FIFA World Cup rant.
Think of money as pubic hair, and FIFA as wax.
Other topics of conversation included FIFA’s $250 million tax exemption  “Somewhere, Wesley Snipes is going ‘So soccer was the answer’” Oliver quipped , and the organization’s insistence on selling alcohol in World Cup stadiums, even though this violated Brazilian law.
FIFA even got Brazil to pass a so-called “Budweiser Bill” allowing for these new beer sales  Budweiser is a major sponsor of FIFA .
And, of course, John Oliver spent plenty of time talking about the corruption and bribery scandals within FIFA.
Most recently, Sunday Times in England reported that former FIFA vice president Mohamed bin Hammam bribed several officials to vote for Qatar as host of the 2022 World Cup.
Bin Hammam, himself a Qatari, was previously kicked out of FIFA following corruption charges.
You are hosting the World Cup somewhere where soccer cannot physically be played,” John Oliver continued.
The Qatar World Cup is shaping up to be the most deadly Middle East construction project since [the Egyptian pyramids,” John Oliver concluded in his FIFA rant.

LONDON –  A former member of FIFA s executive committee was accused Sunday of making payments totaling $5 million to senior football officials in return for support for Qatar s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.
Britain s Sunday Times said it has obtained millions of secret documents proving that Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari who used to be FIFA vice president, was lobbying on his country s behalf ahead of the vote in December 2010.
Bin Hammam made dozens of payments to top football officials in Africa as well as Reynald Temarii and Jack Warner, the former FIFA executive committee members for Oceania and CONCACAF.
The allegations come less than two weeks before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and bring fresh scrutiny on the 2010 vote, which awarded football s biggest tournament to the tiny desert state and currently is under investigation by FIFA s independent ethics prosecutor.
Bin Hamman declined to respond to the allegations and that members of Qatar s bid committee denied any link to the former FIFA official, saying he played no secret role in their campaign.
Bin Hammam, one of the most controversial figures in FIFA s recent history, is no longer a committee member of world football s governing body after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed campaign for its presidency in 2011.
The Sunday Times is alleging, however, that he exploited his position at the heart of FIFA when he was an executive committee member to help to secure votes from key members of its 24-man ruling committee that helped Qatar win the right to host the World Cup.
While addressing FIFA s African and Asian confederations on Monday, FIFA president Sepp Blatter seized the opportunity to mount a defense against the most recent and damning allegations that Qatar bribed its way to the 2022 World Cup.
A recent report by The Sunday Times laid out a smoking paper trail alleging that Qatari FIFA vice president Mohamed bin Hammam made payments to international soccer officials around the world in order to secure votes in favor of Qatar s World Cup bid.
Four of the officials that he allegedly bribed were from FIFA s African confederation, and Sepp Blatter thinks that if you point that out, you re just being racist.
Blatter said:  Once again there is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup.
Back in September, Blatter tried to tell us that anyone who pointed out what a hilariously dumb idea it is to play soccer when it s 120 degrees outside was just being a Euro-centric imperialist .
Soccer’s governing body increased the risk of World Cup referees being approached with bribes by naming the officials five months before this year’s event in Brazil , FIFA’s former head of security said.
Ralf Mutschke, FIFA’s current director of security, said naming World Cup referees well in advance of the tournament “might raise the pressure a little bit, but I think we can deal with it.
Eaton says FIFA appoints referees well ahead of the World Cup for “training and deployment” reasons, though making their identities public is unnecessary.
Eaton said for those games FIFA should change referees at “short notice.
The country’s soccer federation signed an agreement for a company set up by convicted fixer Wilson Raj Perumal to provide referees for those games.
Mutschke, a 33-year police veteran, says a lot of preventative work is going on, including education programs for FIFA’s 209 member associations.
Some of those have had senior officials expelled by FIFA for corruption while question marks exist over the integrity of others.
Among the most high profile examples was in 2011 when Indonesia ’s soccer federation continued to be led by an official even after he was sentenced to jail after being convicted of graft.
I m talking, of course, about the snowballing debacle at FIFA , the global organization that governs the planet s most popular sport, soccer.
On Tuesday, the anti-corruption group Transparency International  TI  demanded that FIFA delay its June 1 presidential election so that the organization can get the bottom of the vote-buying controversy.
Among other things, Transparency International is demanding that FIFA implement new rules to combat corruption, appoint an ombudsman, and review its ethics code.
FIFA s crisis began when the US s only representative to the organization, Chuck Blazer, accused two FIFA colleagues of offering cash bribes to as many as 25 delegates to secure their support in the vote on which nations would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments, the game s biggest competition.
The two officials accused of allegedly bribing delegates no less than Jack Warner, the head of soccer in North and Central America, and Mohammed Bin Hammam, the head of soccer in Asia.
Blatter, the 75-year-old Swiss who s running for his fourth term as FIFA president, has been pulled into the scandal as well, accused of turning a blind eye to the alleged bribery.
TI isn t the only group to demand a delay in the FIFA election.
England s Football Association has joined TI in calling for a postponement of the election, demanding that an independent official step in and make recommendations on how to increase the transparency and integrity of FIFA s internal workings.
This has been a very damaging time for the reputation of FIFA and therefore the whole of football,  the FA said in a statement.
To build on Elizabeth s post below, the captain of the victorious Iraqi soccer team isn t terribly happy with the American.
Now pretty much everyone has abandoned that idea , and FIFA could make it official soon.
The World Cup is the only time when mainstream America pays attention to soccer.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter holds an official 2014 FIFA World Cup soccer ball during a media conference in Sao Paulo June 5, 2014.
Sepp Blatter, the president of the notoriously corrupt governing body for international soccer, FIFA, said Monday that accusing FIFA officials of taking bribes is racism.
He made this declaration while addressing the African and Asian confederations of FIFA, who were holding their own conferences before FIFA’s annual conference.
Two weeks prior, The Sunday Times found overwhelming evidence that Qatari FIFA Vice President Mohamed bin Hammam gave bribes to multiple FIFA officials to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar.
He called the accusers “racist,” adding, “Once again there is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup.
The Secret World of FIFA : Bribes, Vote Rigging and Ticket Scandals” painted FIFA in a hue that many at the world governing body would have rather not seen.
Jennings is one of the few journalists who have written extensively about the inner workings at FIFA.
Let’s discuss your most recent book on FIFA.
You spent seven years on this highly acclaimed work, and FIFA President, Joseph “Sepp” Blatter attempted to place a global ban on your book in a Swiss court.
Let’s say that a person knew very little about FIFA.
There’s always two stories at these big international sport organizations like the IOC and FIFA.
But what you have with FIFA and the IOC is that you have a small group of reporters desperate not to alienate them because they need access to write stories about the head of the IOC or Sepp Blatter of FIFA.
I discovered with FIFA how deep the corruption was, I got into it in late 2000, 2001.
Most of us, my German friends and other researchers, knew that ISL paid bribes to FIFA, international track and field, and to the IOC to get fantastic contracts.
Imagine having the exclusive marketing contract for the soccer World Cup?
They got named in a Swiss court, not FIFA, but 70 million dollars in pounds, double that in dollars these days.
The bulk of the employees at FIFA are humble, work for honest wages, but work for a guy like Blatter who will fire at will… You have to get them to trust you… Not many trust journalists but I am a different type.
Sepp Blatter has been President of FIFA since 1998.
What was his background in business and or sports marketing, along with his ascent to power at FIFA?
In 1974, just after the Winter Olympic Games, he was recruited by FIFA.
I’ve got the documents how they rigged the election, how the bribes were paid, that’s the practice at FIFA.
The Sunday Times, where you once worked, said that you were shown the red card by FIFA, and barred from their press conferences.
He banned me, he put it on the FIFA web site, it’s in the book, that they were going to sue me for writing fiction.
Blatter, why are you and your girlfriends flying on FIFA’s tab?
So I asked him about a million francs, that would be about $600,000, bribe in FIFA’s bank account that should have gone to Joao Havelange, and he just froze.
So I had a much-traveled crew and waited for Blatter outside of FIFA House in Zurich, as they say in English slang, like a ferret out of a drain pipe.
In November 2005, Swiss fraud detectives raided FIFA House in Zurich and obtained documents from the offices of President Blatter, along with his General Secretary, Urs Linsi.
Since 2001, evidence of bribes were found, I reported in 2002 that it went to an Investigative Magistrate, similar to a District Attorney in America, and the investigation started in a little Swiss canton, think of it like a State, there is a picture of Blatter on my web site about it, none of us knew about this, it was a very secretive investigation, and suddenly we heard that the investigation was over, we were waiting for a trial date, and the Magistrate, Thomas Hildbrand whom I am certain is honest, determined, loyal, I thought, he was going after the gangsters, he is going to raid FIFA House, but the surprising thing is that you never read about this in the newspapers.
Because the allegation that the Swiss Magistrate is looking into is the way that the liquidator of the bankrupt marketing company demanded that certain FIFA executives repay the bribes that they pocketed in order to give the contracts.
Yes, they were repaid subsequently, but not by the victims, but the money came out of FIFA.
Now that is of course a fraudulent use of FIFA funds.
Which is coming up on the third anniversary of that raid with the allegation that FIFA’s money was used to repay the bribes.
In America, the soccer Federation won’t do anything to clean up corruption in FIFA.
Chuck Blazer and Jack Warner in Trinidad, and Blazer, some might not know, was accused by a judge of lying, he lied to a court in Manhattan, in FIFA’s case, over MasterCard activity, very critical activities.
Where are the brave people of American football  soccer  who say we want nothing to do with these scum?
GENEVA  AP   – Former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam won his appeal against a lifetime ban but failed to clear his name in an election bribery case on Thursday.
The Qatari official scored a victory at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which lifted his life ban from football imposed by FIFA for allegedly bribing voters during his challenge to Sepp Blatter last year.
It simply overturned the ban because a FIFA probe led by former FBI director Louis Freeh  s agency failed to find conclusive evidence.
It is a situation of  case not proven,  coupled with concern on the part of the Panel that the FIFA investigation was not complete or comprehensive enough to fill the gaps in the record,  sport s highest court said in a statement.
The FIFA Ethics Committee will then decide based on the reports and evidence presented to it if any action is required to be taken against Mohamed bin Hammam,  FIFA said in a statement.
Bin Hammam, who refused to attend FIFA hearings which enforced the life ban, did not attend or testify.
Blatter gave evidence by video link from FIFA headquarters in Zurich.
Bin Hammam and Blatter were locked in a tight race for the presidency and 25 CFU countries were thought to hold the balance of power among the 208 FIFA member nations.
Whistleblowers testified that FIFA vice president Jack Warner , the longtime strongman of Caribbean football, told them he advised Bin Hammam to bring cash instead of formal gifts to the meeting.
It came as no surprise to me,  said Warner, who refused to be investigated by FIFA and instead resigned his positions with the sporting body.
I was not prepared to subject myself to the indignity of FIFA injustice.
Warner said he believed in the principle of  when in doubt the ruling should go in favor of the accused, but FIFA s rule is when in doubt the decision should go in favor of Blatter.
He is also prevented from retaking his seat at FIFA s high table.
Bin Hammam has represented Asia on FIFA s executive committee since 1996.
He was elected AFC president in 2002, and was serving his final four-year mandate when the FIFA election scandal rocked world football.
Bin Hammam had once been Blatter s close ally and worked as a campaign manager for his previous FIFA election victories in 1998 and 2002.
Qatari Emir Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, left, and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, right, hold the World Cup trophy at FIFA s headquarters in Zurich on Dec.
FIFA, soccer s governing body, awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively.
Besides being home to the world s most popular and lucrative soccer league, England has long cultivated an overblown sense of ownership of the game, never ceasing to point out that soccer was created by the English and that it spread throughout the world with their 19th century agents of empire.
America boasts the largest pool of recreational soccer players, an overabundance of stadiums and the world s most multicultural fan base.
In 2003, he acquired the London soccer club Chelsea and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in its success.
He has also invested heavily in Russian soccer; for example, he got the legendary Dutch coach Guus Hiddink hired to run the national team and personally payed Hiddink s wages.

Abramovich has plowed billions of his Siberian-oil wealth into the sport, while other powerful state energy companies, like Gazprom, have considerable investments in soccer at home.
The ability of the host country to provide security for hundreds of thousands of sports tourists has long been a key factor in deciding where FIFA stages its flagship tournament.
Yet FIFA has put its faith in the ability of those security forces to keep the tournament safe.
The World Cup is about to kick off in Brazil, but FIFA is scrambling to save the 2022 game in Qatar that is caught up in a bribery scandal.
But this failed to stop an increase in bus fares, which set off perhaps FIFA’s worst nightmare on the eve of the 2013 Confederations Cup, which was supposed to be the Brazilian Football Confederation’s coming out party for the 2014 World Cup .
Thus, these protests signaled a deep dissatisfaction with both the Brazilian Government and FIFA, perhaps foreshadowing similar events in 2014 when the world’s gaze will be be on Brazil.
It was picked as the host for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, which is a tournament for the best recent winners of the six continental championships and the winners of the world cup.
And lastly, the Brazilian government has passed “Exceptional laws” to cater to FIFA’s demands.
In addition, at FIFA’s demand, the country has set up a 2 km “exclusion” zone around each stadium.
Withing this zone, FIFA has power over who enters these areas and what is sold, essentially superseding the authority of the Brazilian state.
Only goods approved by FIFA can be sold her- thus, a restaurant in this zone could be fined for selling Pepsi instead of Coca Cola  which sponsors the World Cup .
The son-in law of FIFA’s longtime president João Havelange.
Romario has called the CBF a “disgrace,” and believes that Teixeira is “directly a part of everything that has been evil in Brazilian football for the last 10 years” According to Romario, FIFA has robbed the Brazilian public and that the country will be worse off due to the tournament.
Conn, David “Fifa corruption intrigue deepens as Brazil’s Ricardo Teixeira resigns’”.
A vice president of soccer s governing body denied allegations he received favors for backing Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup in a vote already marred by accusations of corruption.
FIFA executive Issa Hayatou is also the head of African soccer.
The British newspaper said that banned former Qatari official Mohammed bin Hammam, once a FIFA vice president, targeted African officials with cash gifts, luxury trips and other favors to influence the voting four years ago.
Hayatou was one of four Africans on FIFA s executive committee when it chose Russia and Qatar as World Cup host countries for 2018 and 2022 in a process tarnished by accusations of vote buying.
Ultimately, only three of those African members voted after Nigeria s Amos Adamu was suspended from the votes and later banned from soccer for three years for seeking bribes during the bidding.
The Sunday Times now says bin Hammam used slush funds to make payments to accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African soccer associations as part of an attempt to eventually influence the voting African members on the executive committee.
He was involved in a payment of $400,000 to the soccer federation in his native Cameroon through FIFA s Goal project, which bin Hammam headed at the time.
The Sunday Times said a  senior FIFA insider  had provided it with  hundreds of millions of emails, accounts and other documents  detailing bin Hammam s attempts to build support for Qatar s bid using money and favors.
Bin Hammam was a member of FIFA s executive committee for 16 years and president of the Asian Football Confederation, but was expelled from FIFA in 2012 for financial corruption.
The 67-year-old Hayatou has been the head of African soccer since 1987.
As soccer fans flock to their televisions for the World Cup final this weekend, the FBI and international investigators are looking ahead to allegations of corruption and abuse halfway around the world in Qatar, where the 2022 games are scheduled to take place in one of the hottest places on earth -- where daytime temperatures regularly reach 124 degrees.
Before Qatar won their bid for the 2022 World Cup, soccer federation officials were warned in advanced about the potentially dangerous heat in Qatar that makes its capital of Doha look like a ghost town during the day – some 40 degrees hotter than during the pause in Brazil.
Not long after the vote, allegations surfaced that some FIFA members had been bribed to vote for Qatar.
Most of the allegations focused on prominent Qatari billionaire businessman Mohammad Bin Hammam, then a FIFA board member accused by The Sunday Times and others of giving cash and lavish gifts.
A FIFA vice president from the Caribbean was forced to resign after allegations surfaced that he took more than $1 million from the Qatari businessman.
Bin Hammam did not respond to questions from ABC News, but after being thrown out of FIFA three years ago for alleged bribes unrelated to the current allegations, he told Sky News,  I did not give any cash gift to anybody.
Alexandra Wrage worked on an independent panel designed to investigate and combat allegations of corruption in FIFA itself before she quit last year out of sheer frustration.
The results of FIFA’s own investigation are expected soon, amid calls for a new vote on who should host the 2022 games.
A report published in England’s Sunday Times alleges FIFA officials accepted payments of around $5m in exchange for supporting Qatar’s bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
But is this document trail the final push FIFA need to call for a revote on who will host the 2022 World Cup?
As a member currently of the Fifa executive committee, we feel that any evidence whatsoever that people involved were bribed to do a certain vote, all that evidence should go to Michael Garcia, whom Fifa have given full authority to.
Fact of the matter is that FIFA – based on the above information – needs to move the World Cup from Qatar, period.
The question isn’t whether FIFA  like the IOC  is bribed, but how openly it’s done and whether it can be covered up.
In this case, it may have been so brazen that even FIFA can’t ignore it or rationalize it.
Ummm Soccer?
In late October, the governing body of international soccer, Fédération Internationale de Football Association  FIFA , announced its new “road map” for reform.
FIFA claims that its new approach will ultimately lead to zero tolerance for bribery and corruption within the international soccer body.
Joseph “Sepp” Blatter, FIFA’s president, promised reform upon his re-election this past June, as the organization repeatedly made headlines due to allegations of vote-fixing for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup selections.
At the same time, though, news of corruption within FIFA and the world of international sports continues to break, leading observers to question whether Blatter’s reforms can work.
In this column, I will discuss the proposed FIFA governance reforms and argue that while the framework is a good step, the substance of the reforms currently remains vague, and needs to be further particularized.
In May 2011, at a meeting in Trinidad and Tobago, a candidate for FIFA’s presidency , Mohamed bin Hammam, allegedly offered $40,000 bribes to Caribbean soccer officials and the president of the Caribbean  Soccer Union, in exchange for their votes.
The allegations sparked a FIFA investigation in which the punishments, handed down on October 14, ranged from reprimands to an 18-month suspension.
Bin Hammam was permanently suspended from FIFA and FIFA’s then-Vice President, Trinidad and Tobago’s Jack Warner, resigned under a cloud.
Then, late this October, FIFA announced that it wanted to speak with 10 more Caribbean officials in its investigation.
Their cases will be submitted by mid-November to the FIFA Ethics Committee.
That brings the number of Caribbean officials currently under investigation by FIFA to 26.
Moreover, FIFA’s scandal is hardly alone in the world of international sports.
And just this week, news reports have indicated that Lamine Diack, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations  IAAF , is under investigation by the Ethics Commission of the International Olympic Committee  IOC  for allegedly taking bribes from Swiss marketing firm ISL  the same company implicated in the FIFA scandal  when it had an exclusive marketing contract for the IAAF Championships.
And even without questions of bribery, there are larger questions of whether FIFA’s bid rules are full of loopholes and leave room for governments to win bids in ways that are unconventional and which depart from traditional notions of open and fair competition.
Some news accounts report that FIFA’s bid requirements fit on two A4 pieces of paper—in contrast with more detailed Olympic bidding requirements.
Finally, it seems that Qatar was perfectly within FIFA rules when, according to news accounts, it paid $50,000 to a South African hospital in seeking the support of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and spent another $1.
As noted above, FIFA president Blatter has announced reforms aimed at promoting transparency and accountability.
Reform is urgently needed, as FIFA faces many seemingly well-founded criticisms.
Critics say that the votes of FIFA’s Executive Committee  which selects countries to host the World Cup  should be publicly disclosed, as secrecy breeds corruption.
They also charge that FIFA’s conflict-of-interest rules are unrealistic, and are not sufficiently comprehensive, allowing certain suspect payments or transactions to occur.
The Good Governance Committee would be comprised of internal and external stakeholders, ranging from referees and soccer fans, to outside civil society organizations and government officials.
One task force would focus on ethics, working to update the FIFA Ethics Code and to develop procedures seeking to stamp out corruption.
FIFA already has a Code of Ethics—adopted in 2004 and updated in 2006—that prohibits a member of FIFA’s Executive Committee from accepting cash payments or “gifts and other benefits that exceed the average relative value of local cultural customs” from third parties.
To clarify the prohibition, FIFA may need to promulgate a guidance or a set of interpretive notes that focuses on typical gifts.
Blatter said that FIFA will also, this December, reopen a case related to ISL, a defunct marketing firm that had done work for FIFA  and allegedly paid kickbacks to FIFA officials and will reveal court documents from the investigation.
To date, FIFA has blocked a Swiss court from revealing which officials repaid $6.
Are the Proposed FIFA Reforms Enough?
Transparency International  TI , the international anti-corruption NGO, has welcomed FIFA’s initial steps, and was asked to advise FIFA as it began its efforts at reform.
TI submitted its own report to FIFA, and has emphasized the importance of creating a multi-stakeholder group to oversee FIFA’s activities, in order to promote accountability.
TI notes, for example, that FIFA needs to supplement its code of ethics with  1  a clear conflict-of-interest policy under which leaders register their interests publicly  for instance, on the FIFA website ;  2  disclosure of the income of leading staff members and the remuneration of members of the Executive Committee and other key bodies;  3  guidelines for the giving and receiving of gifts at all levels of football  i.
Moreover,  6  The composition, scope, and approach of the multi-stakeholder group need to ensure its independence from FIFA.
The UK still remains skeptical of the FIFA process.
There, the  Parliament’s Commons Culture Media and Sport Committee has repeated its call for a “full, independent investigation” of the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and suggested that FIFA’s new anti-corruption measures do not go far enough.
Our concern is that the governance failings revealed by this incident are symptomatic of a wider governance failure within FIFA, and we stand by our recommendation that FIFA commission a full, independent investigation of the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and for the outcome to be made public.
Some FIFA critics have called for the creation of a World Anti-Corruption Committee focused on sports corruption—akin to the World Anti-Doping Agency  WADA .
However, it is often much harder to detect whether a bribe was paid, than whether there is a banned substance in an athlete’s bloodstream.
They, too, ought to emphasize the need for better transparency mechanisms, and should ensure that governments and sporting groups work hard to rebuild public trust in the integrity of soccer and other sports.
FIFA notes in its own mission statement that it stands for integrity, and claims that “We believe that, just as the game itself, FIFA must be a model of fair play, tolerance, sportsmanship and transparency.
As FIFA embarks on its roadmap, let’s hope its journey is not an empty one, and that the organization can finally come closer to living up to its stated goals.
The half-hour programme saw investigative journalist Andrew Jennings look into allegations of corruption with FIFA, the world s governing body of association football.
Within the programme he alleged that three members of FIFA s executive committee had been given bribes by International Sports and Leisure, a marketing partner of FIFA.
Both of these matters had not been properly investigated by Sepp Blatter, the President of FIFA.
It also made a series of claims about the bidding process for hosting the FIFA World Cup.
The documentary was broadcast only three days before the result of the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups were announced.
Russia ultimately won the right to host the FIFA World Cup in 2018, with Qatar emerging victorious for the 2022 tournament.
Hayatou, who is the vice-president of FIFA, denied all accusations of involvement in the scheme and claimed money was in fact paid to the Confederation of African Football  CAF .
I was originally under the impression that two English FIFA reps were caught with their hands in the cookie jar?
The shadowy nature of FIFA is again coming into question and when you consider that Qatar ?
One startling revelation in this documentary is that FIFA want tax breaks that guarantee  reportedly  £3 Billion in tourney earnings and that this should be kept secret from the taxpayers!
Keep it FIFA and expect a call from our lawyers presently.
On the subject of bribes, I have recently read a very good book about bribery in soccer football called The Fix written by a guy named Declan Hill.
It was a fascinating read about bribery in professional soccer football going back many years.
It s been a fact for over 20 years that fifa is a dirty organisation.
Same here in Nrazil, money won all champ of soccer .
Delegates at Fifa’s congress in Zurich were presented with a blue ballot paper bearing only Blatter’s name for president.
This upsets the Fifa family.
We are going to put Fifa’s ship back on the right course, in clear, transparent waters.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘The most important thing in all of this is that the public have confidence in Fifa and, in order for that to happen, we need Fifa to reform.
Earlier this week it was alleged that 25 Caribbean officials were each offered a $40,000  £24,000  bribe three weeks ago to vote for Mohamed Bin Hammam from Qatar in Fifa’s presidential election.
Bin Hammam, Blatter’s only challenger, withdrew his candidacy hours before he was suspended by Fifa’s ethics committee over the bribery allegations along with another executive committee member, Jack Warner of Trinidad, and two other Caribbean officials.
At the same time, an email was revealed in which Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke hinted that Qatar had ‘bought’ the right to stage the 2022 World Cup.
Last night, FA chief Mr Bernstein said: ‘While we did not succeed in deferring the Fifa presidential election, we are confident the FA has played a significant role as a catalyst for change in the way World Cup hosts will be selected in the future.
European soccer leaders told Sepp Blatter not to run for a fifth term as president of FIFA, saying he’s damaged the governing body’s reputation during his 16 years in charge.
Blatter, 78, has been meeting with representatives from FIFA’s 209 member associations to gather support for next year’s vote, after reversing a decision to stand aside.
The Qatari quit the race days before an investigation into claims he tried to bribe voters in the Caribbean with envelopes stuffed with $40,000, leaving Blatter unopposed.
In the last eight or nine years, FIFA has built an ugly reputation, not only in the press but you only have to look at Twitter — #FIFA #Blatter #FIFA Mafia,” Dutch Football Association Chairman Michael van Praag told Blatter after the FIFA president told delegates from the 54 members of European governing body UEFA that the global organization was in the middle of a storm.
Van Praag’s remarks came a day after members of African soccer’s confederation gave Blatter a standing ovation when he told them of his re-election plans.
David Gill, chief executive officer of English Premier League team Manchester United and a member of UEFA’s executive board, said structural changes that FIFA made in the past two years to improve corporate governance don’t do enough.
It’s “the people within that structure that determine whether that structure works, whether it’s effective, whether it’s efficient and delivers for all of us a FIFA that’s fit for purpose,” Gill told reporters.
This is the one that generates all the income for FIFA every four years.
Officials from Germany and Norway, along with former UEFA President Lennart Johansson, who Blatter beat to win his first term as head of FIFA, also spoke out after the meeting at the Renaissance Hotel in Sao Paulo.
People link FIFA to corruption and bribery and all kinds of old boys’ networks,” Van Praag told reporters after addressing Blatter.
About a third of the FIFA executive board members who voted for Qatar’s 2022 bid have left the governing body amid allegations of corruption.
Platini didn’t speak to reporters yesterday, though UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino responded to Blatter’s claims that soccer was facing a “storm.
There is a storm in FIFA and this storm is not new.
Ricardo Teixeira, head of the Brazilian football federation  CBF  for 23 years and a member of the FIFA Executive Committee for 18 years, resigned in March 2012.
His former father-in-law, Joao Havelange, resigned from his honorary FIFA role in April of last year.
In a following FIFA ethics report, the pair’s behavior was described as “morally and ethically reproachable.
He’s spoken of how Brazil has “opened its legs to FIFA,” how FIFA “doesn’t care about what’s going to be left behind.

The 2022 Qatar World Cup Is Already A Disaster - What The Hell Was FIFA Thinking?
You just need to forget sanity and understand how FIFA works.
UPDATE - September 23, 2014: A member of FIFA s executive board has come out and suggested that it s likely the 2022 World Cup, if it s indeed held in Qatar, will lead to fan deaths from the oppressive desert heat .
Is FIFA seriously back-peddling on the decision to give the tournament to Qatar?
Qatar, host for 2022, is so hot in summer that even FIFA’s own evaluation report admitted that the temperatures could endanger the health of players and other visitors.
Moreover, the tiny Gulf state has a hopeless soccer team and doesn’t even pretend to be a democracy.
You just need to forget sanity and understand how FIFA works.
We know that two of the original 24 members of FIFA’s executive committee  ExCo , Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu, looked willing to trade their votes for money when asked by undercover British reporters posing as bidders.
In any case, it’s quite possible that a losing country tried to bribe and the two winners did not.
Rather, let’s use what we do know about FIFA to explain the two choices.
Other members, including FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have shown themselves quite capable of dealing with dictators without throwing up.
In fact, FIFA actively prefers countries without experience in hosting big tournaments.
He wants to be the man who filled in the remaining  white spots  of soccer’s map.
Millions of soccer fans around the world have been waiting four years for the 2014 World Cup, which begins on Thursday.
Though there are lots of hardcore American soccer fans, there are many more that will watch the World Cup this summer but don t know a ton about the sport and might be unaware of some of the Beautiful Game s finer points.
Here s what you need to know to fake it as a legit soccer fan for the 2014 World Cup.
The world s top soccer players spend most of their time playing for privately-owned teams that represent cities in country-specific leagues — like Manchester United or Real Madrid — in a system that roughly parallels American pro sports.
But elite players also spend some of their time playing for their home countries  national teams as part of the World Cup, organized by FIFA  the Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
Black countries didn t enter teams, and grey ones aren t FIFA members.
Unlike in many other team sports, the US team has never been a world soccer power, and only has a single knockout round win since 1930.
To a casual viewer, soccer might seem pretty straightforward: you have two teams of eleven players on a field  called a pitch , both trying to put a spherical ball into the other team s goal.
Like any sport,  the strategy of soccer goes very deep .
So it might come as a surprise that there are actually payouts given to winning teams: FIFA gives out  a total of $576 million , with $35 million going to the champions, $25 million to the runners up, and various amounts to every other team down to $8 million for those eliminated in the group stage.
Though FIFA is spending an estimated $2 billion on the event, they re projected to take in a record  $4 billion from ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and other revenue streams.
These profits are related to the culture of corruption within FIFA, which has been getting attention from everyone from the New York Times to John Oliver in recent days.
Part of the problem is the secret vote used to award World Cup sites, which allegedly led to Qatari officials paying multimillion-dollar bribes to FIFA in exchange for the 2022 World Cup.
That scandal doesn t directly involve this year s World Cup, but it s added to the aura of corruption surrounding FIFA and casts a shadow over the event.
Brazil absolutely loves soccer.
That s why many Brazilians are questioning these investments — especially given FIFA s projected profits from the event.
Qatari and former FIFA official Mohamed bin Hammam is accused of bribing a committee for rights to host the 2022 World Cup.
Former FIFA Executive Mohamed bin Hammam has been charged with bribing members of a World Cup committee that selected Qatar as host for 2022 s tournament.
A former FIFA executive has been accused of bribing soccer officials in exchange for support in Qatar’s controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
Mohamed bin Hammam, a Qatari citizen and former FIFA executive committee member, is alleged to have paid $5 million in cash, gifts, and legal fees to key members of the 24-person committee that selected Qatar as host for 2022’s World Cup back in 2010, according to CNN .
The Qatar 2022 bid committee always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity in its successful bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup,” the committee said in a statement, as reported by the U.
Several FIFA executives are gathering in São Paulo, Brazil this week for an annual congress ahead of 2014’s World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.
I certainly, as a member of the executive committee, would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a revote,” FIFA Vice President Jim Boyce told the BBC  yesterday.
If Garcia comes up with concrete evidence and concrete evidence is given to the executive committee and to FIFA, then it has to be looked at very seriously,” he said.
Bin Hammam is accused of establishing as many as 10 slush funds to dole out money to FIFA officials in exchange for their support of a Qatari World Cup bid.
He also allegedly distributed more than $400,000 in cash at parties for African soccer officials to garner support, according to Sky News .
Bin Hammam was a member of the FIFA committee that awarded hosting rights to Qatar.
He was even considered a candidate for FIFA’s presidency when he ran against current President Sepp Blatter in 2011, according to the BBC .
Then-FIFA vice president and current Trinidad politician Jack Warner was suspended from soccer s governing body for an alleged connection to bin Hammam’s 2011 bribery case.
At the time, Warner was the longest-serving member of FIFA’s executive committee, according to the Guardian .
Warner described claims of his connection with bin Hammam and an illegitimate 2022 World Cup as “foolishness” and a “witch hunt” organized by FIFA, according to the Guardian .
FIFA instituted a lifetime ban on bin Hammam in 2012, citing “repeated violations” of FIFA’s code of ethics, specifically relating to conflicts of interest, during his tenure as Asian Football Confederation President, according to a FIFA news release .
Concern over the effects the intense heat would have on fans and players led Blatter, the FIFA president, to suggest moving the 2022 tournament to winter months, possibly November, December or January, as reported by the BBC .
While this would allow for a healthier playing environment in Qatar, a winter schedule would interfere with international club soccer schedules, notably among players under contract in Barclays Premier League in the U.
Ralf Mutschke, head of security at FIFA, football’s global overseer, says match-fixing offers “low risk and high gain”.
And FIFA’s plan to loosen the licensing system for football agents  a few of whom connive in money-laundering and other offences , and its equivocal stance on third-party interests in players is seen by critics as evidence of complacency.
Sylvia Schenk of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, argues that “without good governance, FIFA will have no credibility to tell players and referees that they have to stick to the rules”.
The outcome, says Damian Collins, a British MP who is critical of FIFA, is that “nothing has really changed”.
An internal report recently found that Sepp Blatter, the organisation’s president since 1998, had been “clumsy” in his response to evidence of a huge bribe that was destined for someone else.
Wilson Raj Perumal is one of the most infamous names in the soccer community today.
Perumal said in the interview,  If FIFA really wanted to do something, they could.
Later, he said,  FIFA could be doing a lot of things to stop international friendlies from being manipulated, including checking on the background of the organizers and whether an outside agent is involved.
Perumal didn t just place bets on soccer games.
The success of so many soccer betters remains because of low relevance of many games and location.
With soccer being the most popular sport in the world, it will always have a number individuals and groups that will give it a bad name.
There s no proof or verification whatsoever that FIFA has any ties to this underground fixing corruption.
Mohamed bin Hammam, once a high-ranking member of FIFA s executive cabal before being excommunicated from power after daring to run against Sepp Blatter for the role of FIFA president, has been implicated—again—for lobbying on behalf of Qatar in advance of the 2010 vote that awarded the 2022 World Cup to the tiny desert nation over the United States of America.
It s time for FIFA to correct this mistake, right this amazingly transparent wrong and take the World Cup back from Qatar.
Even if each document was just one sheet, that would be 2,000 reams, but the report states that millions—plural—were uncovered, meaning that somewhere in the world there is a room with upward of 4,000 reams of paper implicating bin Hammam and his network of swindlers in paying off FIFA voters to give the World Cup to Qatar.
Now the Sunday Times, based on a massive leak from unnamed sources in FIFA, has assembled a picture of Bin Hammam flying around the world, including on the emir of Qatar s private jet, lobbying for the Qatar 2022 bid, dishing out cash gifts and lavish hospitality, to Warner, Temarii and African football delegates who appeared depressingly keen to take it.
Bin Hammam was a power player within FIFA for more than a decade and a half, serving as one of the most influential characters in the world of international football in his time as the president of the Asian Football Confederation.
That is, until 2012, when Bin Hammam, one of a host of executives planning a coup on Blatter s reign, was cast out in an effort to clean up FIFA s rampant corruption.
The FIFA spin machine quickly tried to offer context, saying that Blatter meant the mistake was to put the World Cup in Qatar in the summer, but it was not a mistake to give Qatar the event at all.
The simple fact that the FIFA committee had to formally look into the viability of hosting the event in Qatar in the traditional summer months—talk last year created a scenario in which the World Cup would be held in a cooler time of year, during domestic league play—made giving a World Cup to Qatar a bad idea.
Or what about the fact that Qatar has had 1,200 deaths to migrant workers, via Kevin Maguire of the Daily Mirror, a horrific problem that caused FIFA to take a far more hands-on approach to the stadium-building process?
How in good conscience could FIFA have given a bid to a nation that would allow that many people to die while working under such horrific conditions, where basic human rights can be deemed illegal and where the average temperature exceeds 105 degrees  every single day?
If a member of the FIFA selection process was given a free refill on a drink at some point in the last three years that could somehow connect him to Qatar, Blatter needs to find out and use it to burn him.
Everything is ready and in working order, other than FIFA s broken moral compass.
Is FIFA worried about the money?
The 1994 World Cup was the most successful tournament in the event s history in terms of cash-in for FIFA, and that was 20 years ago, when soccer had nothing close to the foothold in American culture it has today.
If Blatter wants to grow the game, there is no nation with more growth potential for soccer than the United States.
Sure, there are already millions of young kids playing soccer here, and putting a World Cup in South Africa or Qatar  or even Russia  could help produce the infrastructure an influx of FIFA money can provide in those parts of the world, but that s all just money.
Hell, lots of us thought it long before Sunday, when the Times of London reported that Qatar s former top football official -- the famously corrupt Mohamed Bin Hammam -- had bribed FIFA officials and their connections to land the 2022 World Cup.
Anyone who follows soccer in this country, football in others, instantly wondered how that could happen.
As far as that proof goes, the Times reported that it has documents -- seen also by BBC Sports Editor David Bond -- that Bin Hammam had made payments into accounts controlled by the leaders of 30 high-ranking African soccer officials to secure their support within FIFA for Qatar s bid.
Bin Hammam has been banned for life by FIFA twice, once after trying to bribe his way into the FIFA presidency in 2011, then again in 2012  after his first ban was overturned  for the unseemly way he ran the Asian Football Confederation s Champions League.
Indict  em all -- everyone who extended a bribe, everyone who accepted, everyone whose vote for Qatar was influenced by such a thing -- and let the court systems sort it out.
That place can t be trusted with something as trivial as a soccer stadium, much less something as substantial as justice for the dead.
Simple: With every day that passes, Qatar demonstrates how misguided and wrong FIFA was to award the oil-rich Middle Eastern nation one of the world’s greatest sporting honors.
Thus, before it’s too late, we implore FIFA and its members to strip Qatar of the World Cup.
I am a resident, came in second in FIFA voting and would be the obvious choice to replace Qatar.
Allegations of bribery have been rampant: Back in 2011, FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke wrote in an email that Qatar  “bought the right to host.
Recently, a story broke about the 10-year-old daughter of a former FIFA executive  receiving £2 million in her bank account three years ago.
Qatar even bought off French soccer legend  Zinedine Zidane , paying him $1 million to support their bid.
Some of these accusations  have been retracted , and much of the blame for these allegations lies with FIFA, which appears to be as corrupt as any sporting organization in the world.
How many more people have to die so we can watch soccer?
How many deaths are excusable in the name of building soccer stadiums?
Qatar promised      12 World Cup stadiums, some of which would be broken down afterwards and      used to create soccer stadiums in developing countries around the world.
Now, Qatar will only build eight stadiums, the minimum required by FIFA       Brazil will use 12 stadiums; South Africa had 10 .
Addressing      concerns that it would be too hot to play soccer in the summer in Qatar,      officials promised a ground-breaking air-conditioning system in each      stadium.
Except,      it doesn’t — the technology was never tested in World Cup-sized stadiums,      and FIFA now considers playing summer soccer in Qatar a “health      risk.
That means the      summer World Cup we’re all used to, and want, probably won’t happen,      because, duh, fucking soccer in the Middle East in July?
It’s going to ruin non-World Cup soccer for months.
There’s a reason the World Cup usually takes place in June and July: most major soccer leagues are on break by then.
That’s what will happen to soccer if the Cup is moved to “November and December,” as is expected due to extreme heat in Qatar.
Speaking of the NFL, how likely are you to watch a soccer match that coincides with an NFL game?
Answer: not very, unless you’re one of those guys who like soccer futbol more than football.
Understand: I get that part of the reasoning for giving Qatar a World Cup was to show how non-Western countries could host a major soccer tournament.
Besides, which market should FIFA cater to if they want to create more soccer fans: Qatar  population: 2.
The World Cup is about to kick off in Brazil, but FIFA is scrambling to save the 2022 game in Qatar that is caught up in a bribery scandal.
It didn t detail a smoking gun tying the Qatari bid committee directly to the four Africans on the FIFA executive committee but uncovered 10 slush funds used to buy up support within African soccer.
The magnitude of the corruption will be another blow to FIFA and the international view of it being a deeply flawed institution.
The Sunday Times, whose articles are behind a pay wall, reported that a  senior figure  inside FIFA decided to  blow the whistle  on Qatar 2022 and leaked it the documents, many of them it posted.
The evidence includes emails, faxes, phone records, flight logs, bank transfer slips and other documents and accounts all involving bin Hammam, the Qatari who was the president of the Asian Football Confederation and member of the FIFA executive committee at the time of the vote for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup in December 2010.
Bin Hammam was the next year kicked out of FIFA in a bribery scandal involving then-Concacaf president Jack Warner as he sought to win support in the Caribbean for his bid to unseat FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
Qatar won the vote of the FIFA executive committee by 14-8.
It has pushed ahead with its plans for the 2022 World Cup though FIFA has yet to decide when to hold the tournament -- summer or winter.
What bothers me most is they won saying they could provide air conditioning in the soccer stadiums by 2022 and have since back off of that.
With the World Cup kicking off this Thursday, the month of June should be FIFA’s moment in the sun.
Instead, the skies continue to darken over soccer s international governing body.
It all started on June 1, when The Sunday Times exposed that Mohamed bin Hammam, a former member of FIFA’s executive committee, had secretly bribed soccer officials worldwide nearly $5 million in an attempt to win votes for Qatar’s successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
This wasn’t the first corruption charge leveled at bin Hammam: he was banned from FIFA in 2012 on charges of bribery, though the decision was later overturned .
Then, on Friday, Dave Zirin, The Nation sports columnist who recently published a book on the neoliberal policy behind the Brazil World Cup, made the case in the New York Times for kicking FIFA out of the sport altogether.
It is past time to abolish FIFA,” Zirin wrote.
On last night’s episode of “Last Week Tonight” on HBO, he took FIFA to task for its latest wave of corruption and bribery scandals.
The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,” a spokesman for Adidas told The Guardian.
Perhaps corporate pressure will accomplish what mockery and muckraking have failed to do: convince FIFA to reform.
The Fédération Internationale de Football Association  FIFA  is the global governing body for soccer.
With 209 member associations around the world, FIFA is responsible for promoting the game globally and for organising international competitions; spearheaded by the FIFA World Cup, an international soccer tournament held every four years.
The 2014 FIFA World Cup, currently under way in Brazil, has 32 national teams vying for the coveted World Cup trophy and millions around the world tuning in to watch the event.
However, behind the scenes, FIFA faces fresh allegations of bribery and corruption in relation to the bidding process that resulted in the selection of Russia and Qatar as World Cup host countries in 2018 and 2022.
In 2009, FIFA received bids from 11 countries to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cup events.
Of the 24 FIFA executive committee members, 22 were considered eligible to vote in 2010 after two were found to have accepted bribes and were suspended.
While allegations of bribery and corruption have plagued FIFA for years, British newspaper, The Sunday Times, recently published “proof” in the form of leaked documents.
The cache of emails, allegedly from a “senior FIFA insider”, revealed that former FIFA executive committee member, Mohamed bin Hammam paid more than $5 million to secure support for Qatar’s 2022 World Cup bid.
In 2012, the FIFA ethics committee had banned Mr bin Hammam, a Qatari national, from all football activities over “conflicts of interest”.
According to the evidence, Mr Hammam reportedly lavished cash payments, gifts and trips upon FIFA’s executive and African officials in exchange for their votes.
The scandal has thrown the spotlight onto FIFA’s secretive voting procedures and general lack of transparency.
Born in Switzerland in 1936, Joseph “Sepp” Blatter was first elected president of FIFA in 1998, then subsequently re-elected in 2002, 2007 and 2011.
He has been heavily criticised for stating publicly that the exposure of the story in the British press was motivated by “discrimination and racism” as well as a desire to “destroy FIFA” as an institution.
They say that as president, Mr Blatter is responsible for FIFA’s management and therefore inextricably connected to all its operations.
They claim his continued presence is damaging both the game and FIFA’s standing as an organisation.
Prominent US lawyer, Michael Garcia, was appointed to lead the investigations arm of the FIFA ethics committee in 2012 following numerous allegations of corruption and pressure placed upon Mr Blatter.
Others say that if FIFA refuses a revote, it could lead to open revolt, with major national football associations such as England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain boycotting the next World Cup - a move that would encourage others to follow - or, withdrawing from FIFA altogether to found a new governing body that is transparent and accountable.
They ask: why should FIFA be exempt from public scrutiny, given its mission is to enhance the game of soccer for all?
However, while change is considered crucial for FIFA’s survival - including a change of leadership - many fear that it is only through external pressure from the media, sponsors, football associations, football fans and governments, that it is likely to occur.
I think FIFA need another vote.
There is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup.
I still have fire inside me and if we show unity that is the best way to deal with those in the world that want to destroy FIFA.
The allegations being made have nothing to do with racism, they are allegations about corruption within FIFA.
Mr Blatter, many of us are deeply troubled by your reaction to these allegations, it’s time for FIFA to stop attacking the messenger and instead consider and understand the message.
What is the way forward for FIFA?
There have been countless occasions of corruption, scandals and other awful scenarios from FIFA over the years, even though it is in charge of the world’s most popular sport.
The unclean nature of FIFA has not consistently been the subject of headlines worldwide.
What about this particular controversy is so special that FIFA’s corruption is finally being discussed publicly, that its dubious decision-making processes are finally the subject of intense speculation and debate worldwide?
It began approximately 4 years ago, in December 2010, when FIFA announced that Qatar won the vote to host the 2022 World Cup.
Qatar was a random, tiny state with no known affinity for soccer — certainly not to the degree of the British anyway.
Indeed, in 2013, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said the vote could have been affected by “direct, political influence” from countries who had economic interest in Qatar.
The corruption theme took flight a few months after the vote, when Qatar’s representative on FIFA’s executive council, Mohammed Bin Hammam, was accused of bribery in his attempt to win votes for the FIFA presidential election and was banned from soccer.
No direct connection has been made, but the fact that FIFA has not put down these allegations either has helped to strengthen the potential that Qatar bribed its way to the World Cup.
Problems with the practicality of actually having the World Cup have put both FIFA and Qatar under further strain.
Blatter has noted that FIFA has some responsibility for issues like these, but believes they are primarily the responsibility of the state of Qatar.
To put it in other words, FIFA will not intervene.
The ideal view is that FIFA is working to expand the popularity of the beautiful sport of soccer.
The reality, however, leans more towards FIFA’s desire to reach into untouched markets and increase profit.
Unfortunately, this is problematic for domestic soccer leagues and other sports competitions that usually run during this time.
The Qataris do also have arguments they use to distance themselves from the FIFA corruption aspect of the controversy.
In his new book “Futebol Nation,” author David Goldblatt puts forth the claim that any dealing within FIFA nowadays is one that relies on “patronage and payments, mixing personal, political and commercial interests until they are virtually indistinguishable.
That doesn’t necessarily make any Qatari bribing better, but it does indicate that they shouldn’t be singled out for it; FIFA should probably be held just as, if not more accountable, for the nature of these dealings.
This mess of problems has come to the point where FIFA seems to be attempting to withdraw from the original decision to let Qatar have the World Cup.
One FIFA executive official called the decision “a mistake.
Should FIFA be more responsible for the host nations and hold them more accountable?
For that matter, is Qatar or FIFA more at fault for the issues that have come up?
There will be displeased parties in either scenario, but what about FIFA?
Will its corruptness as an institution continue to be the norm, something inevitable that soccer fans worldwide must deal with?
Truthfully, it doesn’t seem like FIFA will change anytime soon.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the host nation for the FIFA World Cup 2022, in Zurich, Dec.
So revoking the 2022 selection of Qatar – as at least one senior FIFA official has suggested could happen – and re-opening the competition for a host nation would strike a huge blow to the country’s prestige.
And they come just as as FIFA is already reeling from a match-fixing scandal, and controversy over the $11 billion Brazil is spending, amid widespread poverty and social ills.
There’s no justification for FIFA having so little transparency, except corruption.
Their job is to organize soccer games.
THE FIFA SCANDAL is worldwide and an individual aspiring for the highest office of the country, the presidency in a country noted for systematic corruption should be above the fray before brining changes in the fight against corporation on the national level.
EVEN President ELLEN Johnson Sirleaf who until becoming President spoke against the same menace, has fallen prey to it, failing to fight corruption head-on, therefore Weah’s purported involvement in the FIFA scandal strongly suggests that he will make no difference in the fight against corruption on home soil when elected President.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING the Qatar scandal presents a different picture of the soccer legend as a scandal of such international nature means, Weah is not free of corruption and moving unto the Presidency provides another risky chance for Liberia in fighting corruption.
Originally, FIFA investigator Michael Garcia said he would have the report submitted to Joachim Eckert -- the judge for the adjudicatory chamber of the Ethics Committee -- by late July.
Whatever is included in the report could potentially lead to formal legal proceedings if FIFA decides to pursue them, but FIFA President Sepp Blatter has insisted that only the FIFA executive committee has the power to strip Russia or Qatar of their hosting rights so the biggest hammer that could fall on Russia or Qatar still belongs to FIFA.
Blame FIFA.
Brazilians, the most happy-go-lucky, most soccer-loving people in the world, were jeering their own team on the eve of the World Cup.
Oh, and another thing: FIFA doesn t care.
Every four years, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, a Swiss bank that occasionally stages soccer games, alights on a country for a month or so to plunder as much bullion as possible.
In 2010, the target was South Africa, where FIFA wrung max dollars from government deals and compelled the construction of stadiums—several of which may never again be filled—in a country with some of the highest income inequality in the world.
In South Africa, FIFA demanded that the parliament pass legislation to ensure that nettlesome things like labor regulations didn t interfere with business.
In Brazil, FIFA made the host country ignore its own law prohibiting alcohol sales in stadiums  to prevent rowdies from getting too sauced  so World Cup sponsor Budweiser can push its suds.
Inside them, only FIFA-approved products can be sold.
It was an incongruous sight: women sipping caipirinhas in thongs and men playing soccer volleyball in Speedos while the military stood by to rain shells on the mass of humanity that might pour from the hills at any moment.
I had to beg off an assignment to cover the protests because I couldn’t find any, just a counter-FIFA gathering that sounded more like a hipster art installation with popcorn and drinks.
This is what FIFA counts on.
If they start winning, the party will crank up and the troubles will be forgotten, at least until FIFA can hightail it out of town.
A trophy was nothing to hope for, since it meant victory for FIFA and a broken system.
But FIFA would win, because that s what multinational corporations do everywhere, even the ones that claim to be nonprofits .
Long-standing accusations of corruption in the International Federation of Association Football  FIFA , the world soccer governing body, have picked up traction lately, forcing two top officials in the organization to step aside in light of accusations that they offered $40,000 bribes to two dozen officials in an attempt to buy their votes for the presidency.
Eight of FIFA’s 24 executive committee members were accused of selling or attempting to sell votes for that World Cup, as well as the 2018 event that went to Russia.
Said the FIFA general secretary: “It’s sad.
I still have fire inside me,  he said today in Sao Paulo as he met with soccer officials from Asia, Africa and South America.
For one, he has increased spending on personnel, management and the FIFA ruling bodies, to about 21 percent of all expenses in 2013 from about 17 percent in the years 1999 to 2002.
That s more than the 14 percent of revenue that FIFA spends on what it calls  development : aid programs for national soccer associations, women s soccer, charity and education projects.
It s as if FIFA were a country where the central bureaucracy absorbs more money than health, education and subsidies to poorer regions put together.
In 2007, for example, FIFA banned games at stadiums more than 8,200 feet above sea level.
By contrast, Blatter s predecessor, Joao Havelange, boosted FIFA s membership from 142 to 204 federations, and recast the rules in ways that made the game more dynamic and enjoyable to watch -- and less rough.
Blatter has also done little to combat the corruption that flourished under Havelange, who was proved to have taken bribes and forced out as FIFA s honorary president last year.
Blatter has worked at FIFA since 1975, having joined the organization a year after Havelange s election.
In a 2010 interview , he said he was fully behind FIFA s decision to play the 2022 World Cup in Qatar in June and July, the equivalent of playing on a frying pan in hell.
Blatter could have done much more for soccer federations in developing nations, giving them a bigger share of FIFA s sponsorship and TV-rights revenue, and making sure they weren t run by thieves.
The often greedy and unscrupulous soccer officials from poor countries are, however, Blatter s political base.
No matter how much  fire  he has left in him, Blatter, too, should go -- if only to save FIFA s reputation.

So how does a country get a sports event like Soccer’s World Cup?
It goes to show just how susceptible FIFA was to bribes.
Of course, the counterargument is “Why bribe the officials if you know your sales pitch is the best?
Bin Hammam was banned in 2011 after it was discovered that he was trying to bribe officials in a bid to get elected as FIFA President, so reports of his activities in securing the Qatari vote should not be a surprise.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter is seen on a big screen as he delivers a speech during the opening ceremony of the 65th FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo June 11, 2014.
SAO PAULO  Reuters  - FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Wednesday all but confirmed he would run for re-election despite criticism that the game and organisation have been tarnished by accusations of corruption during his long reign.
World soccer s governing body is reeling after allegations in Britain s Sunday Times that a former top FIFA representative made payments to officials as part of a campaign to win support for Qatar s successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
Yet Blatter, who has led FIFA for 16 years, made no direct reference to the scandal throughout Wednesday s annual Congress, and instead pressed his case to extend his tenure.
My mission is not finished,  he told officials from FIFA s 209 member associations at the close of Congress, held in Sao Paulo on the eve of the opening game of Brazil s 2014 World Cup.
Blatter, who ignored calls made this week by European countries not to run again in next year s FIFA election, enjoys the support of enough delegates to have his way.
Earlier at the Congress, the lawyer investigating allegations of corruption surrounding FIFA said he would leave no stone unturned in a bid to dispel concerns that the probe would not take into account key evidence that recently came to light.
Michael Garcia handed in a report this week on the findings from nearly two years of work, but told FIFA delegates it did not signal the end of his investigation.
The Sunday Times newspaper reported recently that some of the  millions of documents  it had seen linked payments by former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam to officials to win backing for Qatar s World Cup bid.
Bin Hammam has not commented on his involvement since he was banned for life from soccer in 2012, while Qataris working on the project say he was not a part of their official bid.
We have gone to what appears to us to be the original source of that data and we are confident we will have full access to whatever else may be in that data set and we will review that data for anything else relevant prior to issuing any final report,  he told FIFA.
Allegations over Qatar s bid overshadowed the buildup to the World Cup, yet they were barely mentioned at FIFA s Congress.
Senior soccer officials from Europe, concerned that FIFA s image was being irrevocably damaged by scandals that have dogged it for years, told Blatter bluntly that he should not run again.
He declined to comment on remarks by David Triesman, former head of English soccer s governing body, who told the upper house of Britain s parliament that FIFA was corrupt and any investigations it conducted into itself were cover-ups.
A FIFA spokesman declined to comment on the remarks.
As European soccer lined up against Blatter, he won overwhelming support during meetings with delegates from Africa, Asia, Oceania and beyond, suggesting that he would comfortably win an election should he decide to take part.
The  ignorant  British media has led the attacks on Qatar, he said in a speech days after the Sunday Times published the second in a series of reports putting African soccer bosses at the centre of bribery allegations to secure the 2022 tournament for the tiny Gulf nation.
The rows over Qatar and Blatter s future have diverted much of FIFA s attention away from the Brazil World Cup, which opens on Thursday with the hosts taking on Croatia.
Nothing but a win will do for a country that many people consider the spiritual home of soccer, and victory on the pitch might generate more excitement off it after a surprisingly subdued buildup to the tournament.
The German judge also suggested on Friday it was not his job to remove Russia or Qatar as hosts or order a re-vote based on FIFA prosecutor Michael Garcia s investigation.
In giving his first detailed insight on a case likely to define FIFA s attempts to repair its scandal-ridden image, Eckert pushed back the expected deadline for verdicts.
There will be some decisions, maybe in spring,  Eckert said on the sidelines of an ethics in sport conference hosted by FIFA.
Eckert s comments will disappoint FIFA critics, who believed he could strip hosting rights.
Those would be decisions for FIFA s ruling executive committee -- which still includes 12 men who voted in the December 2010 polls -- or its congress of 209 federations, Eckert said.
Those initial reports detailed  conclusions concerning further action with respect to certain individuals,  FIFA said in a statement this month.
No one at FIFA, including president Sepp Blatter, has read the confidential reports, the judge insisted.
No one has called me,  Eckert said, suggesting that would breach the FIFA code of ethics.
Some voting members of the FIFA board have since left football while under investigation in other corruption cases, and refused to cooperate.
Over the weekend, two stories broke involving alleged corruption and FIFA , the Swiss-based international organization that oversees soccer worldwide  including the World Cup .
Research I conducted  recently suggests that FIFA faces considerable obstacles to dealing with corruption, both on the field and within its ranks.
Second, in London, The Sunday Times published a trove of documents from a FIFA whistleblower detailing payments to FIFA officials made by a former FIFA executive in Qatar, allegedly to help Qatar win the vote to host the 2022 World Cup .
The Sunday Times’ revelations are the latest in a long series of similar stories surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cup votes  conducted simultaneously  dating to 2010, when The Sunday Times went undercover to reveal several members of FIFA’s executive committee trying to sell their votes for cash.
For FIFA, unfortunately, allegations of corruption and bribery are nothing new.
In 2011, FIFA embarked on a governance-reform effort to address an earlier round of accusations of corruption.
And a 2012 report by FIFA’s governance-reform committee.
There are obviously some judgment calls here, but what I found does not lend itself to much optimism that FIFA has fixed its problems, and thus improved its ability to deal with corruption on and off the pitch.
Of the 59 total recommendations in the three reports, FIFA implemented only seven, partially implemented 10 and failed to implement 42.
There is some overlap across the reports, and a close look at reforms left undone reveals nine important areas where action has been recommended for FIFA to raise its governance standards to those expected in the international business community.
Although FIFA took some positive steps, such as creating a ethics committee with investigative powers, it avoided many steps that are basic to governance of organizations which turn over billions of dollars every year.
For example, FIFA stood firm that it would not release the compensation of its president, Sepp Blatter.
For FIFA, the project of governance reform has a long way to go.
The good news for soccer fans and fans of good governance is that the pressure on FIFA to raise its game continues to mount.
At this point, the corruption and greed that runs through the top officials in FIFA is the status quo.
On Friday, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said they will not release the investigative report that supposedly uncovers corruption into the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup competitions.
Blatter and other top-ranking FIFA officials are simply ignoring any pressure to release the report.
Despite public outcries, Blatter said there were no requests to release the report as part of media availability during FIFA meetings in Zurich.
The new members are calling for the results to be shared, but they would have to find a way to change FIFA regulations.
Hans-Joachim Eckert, who is in charge of FIFA’s independent ethics committee, has said that only the impressions of the report will be released.
Right now, Blatter and FIFA can just ignore corruption claims knowing there isn’t enough opposition.
Ignoring corruption and wrongdoing as an operating tactic is expected from FIFA.
At this point, it will take something drastic for FIFA to change their ways.

June 9, 2014: FIFA , the global organizing body that oversees soccer and the World Cup , has unveiled a multi-level marketing campaign in time for the event, which begins on June 12.
The campaign comes as FIFA s own global marketing partners and World Cup sponsors are releasing their own efforts to support the month-long event.
It also comes as many of FIFA s partners have openly questioned the selection of Qatar as host of the 2022 World Cup, a situation that has come under fire due to reports of bribes and other illegalities.
According to FIFA, the  Elements  campaign  seeks to raise awareness about crucial issues in football.
The TV portion of the campaign is scheduled to be broadcast by FIFA s media rights licensees to global audiences during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which runs through July 13.
This gives FIFA access to a potential viewing audience of billions of football fans during our flagship competition,  according to soccer s governing body.
This huge platform gives FIFA an amazing opportunity to speak to a global audience,” Walter De Gregorio, director of communications and public affairs for FIFA, said in a statement.
A generic 30-second spot,   Seeds ,  shows a soccer ball buried in the ground, being watered and turing barren and desert lands into grassy, fertile areas on which soccer can be played and families can thrive.
An anti-discrimination-themed spot,   Fan of the Match ,  shows that soccer is for everyone, despite age, race or physical challenges.
Pitch Warfare   is tagged as an  anti-match manipulation  spot that  sends a powerful message that FIFA and its member associations are fighting match manipulation together.
It follows a soccer ball that having great difficulty getting to the net due to such obstacles as an inordinate number of yellow flags, chalk hands that swipe at the ball and a pitch the unexpectedly buckles like a giant wave and then goes flat but in an extremely high angle.
According to FIFA s De Gregorio, “We also felt it was crucial to let more people know about our work in football development, which is where so much of the proceeds from the FIFA World Cup go to.
Few people know that FIFA invests more than half a million dollars every day in developing football everywhere, from the grassroots up.
Even as the campaign goes worldwide, global partners of FIFA have openly expressed concern about a report in the London Times that the bidding process and eventual selection of Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup involved brides, corruption and other unethical situations.
Only FIFA global partner Emirates Airline has not as yet gone public with its opinion.
The World Cup kicks off on Thursday in Brazil, but all the talk is about the corrupt practices of the governing body for the sport of soccer  FIFA .
What was already known was revealed to be true: FIFA officials were bribed in the process of Qatar making a winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
HBO comedian and television show host John Oliver summed up just how horrible FIFA has been while admitting that he is still excited about seeing the sport he loves.
Soccer is] an organized religion, and FIFA is its church.
If you need a catch up on all the terrible things that are associated with FIFA and the World Cup’s preparations in Brazil and Qatar, Oliver’s 13 minute description is a good start.
In the soccer world, FIFA—the governing body of the sport—is something like a cross between the United Nations and the Kremlin.
But this weekend a report by The Sunday Times  revealed damning evidence that FIFA members were bribed and bought off to support Qatar s bid for the 2022 World Cup.
Andrew Jennings, the  author of   Omertà: Sepp Blatter s FIFA Organised Crime Family ,  weighs in on the alleged plot to buy the 2022 World Cup.
They say that they ve got hundreds of millions of emails and bank payments showing that Qatar was systematically paying anybody who moved in FIFA.
It s not just The Sunday Times shedding light on potential FIFA corruption.
There are only two big games that I know which were fixed that matter, and FIFA fixed them,  says Jennings.
Nobody s ever taken FIFA to task for that because the Spanish and Italian people at FIFA, well they re closer to FIFA than their own countries.
About 12 years ago Jennings started looking into FIFA as an investigative journalist—he found that the organization is highly secretive.
They don t publish anything—you can t find out what  FIFA President  Sepp Blatter earns, you d have to nail him to the floor and then he probably wouldn t tell you,  says Jennings.
People at FIFA don t care,  he says.
The report by The Sunday Times alleges that a former FIFA’s executive paid more than $5 million to other senior officials officials in exchange for support for Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.
FIFA banned senior Caribbean official Horace Burrell for six months on Friday for the Jamaican s part in a bribery case involving former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam, plunging the region s soccer authorities deeper into chaos.
FIFA banned senior Caribbean official Horace Burrell for six months on Friday for the Jamaican s part in a bribery case involving former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam, plunging the region s soccer authorities deeper into chaos.
Burrell, a long-time ally of former FIFA vice president Jack Warner and a member of FIFA s disciplinary committee, must now withdraw from the Caribbean Football Union presidential election scheduled for next month.
Since the bribery scandal broke in May, the CONCACAF continental body has seen its top three elected Caribbean officials - Warner, Burrell and Lisle Austin - either resign while under investigation or be banned by FIFA.
He said it will be up to the JFF to decide his future with the national body - whether to replace him temporarily for the length of the ban or permanently - but he still saw a future for himself within FIFA.
I have no reason to doubt that I shall be readmitted to my present FIFA functions after the three-months suspension has been served,  Burrell said.
Franka Pickering, president of the British Virgin Islands federation and one of the most senior women in world soccer, was suspended for 18 months.
FIFA issued 30-day bans to Osiris Guzman, president of the Dominican Republic soccer federation, and St.
The Qatari official made a campaign visit to Trinidad, the home island of then-CFU leader Warner, to woo voters during his challenge to FIFA President Sepp Blatter.
Bin Hammam was banned for life by FIFA in July.
But we must also be happy that FIFA is taking steps to clean the nest of corruption in Caribbean football.
Blazer s alert to FIFA led the body to hire former FBI director Louis Freeh s investigation agency to interview Caribbean officials and gather evidence for the ethics panel.
Kitts and Nevis soccer president Anthony Johnson, U.
Virgin Islands president Hillaren Frederick and Aubrey Liburd, vice president of the British Virgin Islands soccer body.
Five others received warnings, including FIFA committee members Yves Jean-Bart, the Haiti soccer president, and Richard Groden, Trinidad and Tobago s general secretary.
Should they return to football official positions, their cases would be examined again by the ethics committee,  FIFA said in a statement.
Also Friday, FIFA said a hearing into the case of Guyana official Noel Adonis was postponed and a case left open into the conduct of St.
After the scandal emerged, bin Hammam withdrew his election bid three days before the FIFA vote in June.
He was endorsed by 186 FIFA members, including most Caribbean islands.
Blatter is scheduled next Friday to provide the first details of his promised anti-corruption project to clean up world soccer and its damaged image.
