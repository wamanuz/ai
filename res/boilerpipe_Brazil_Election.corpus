Brazil s President and presidential candidate for the Workers  Party Dilma Rousseff, speaks during a meeting with Governors and Senators elected in the first round of general elections, in Brasilia, Brazil on Oct.
7, 2014.
The economy takes center stage as incumbent President Dilma Rousseff takes on business-friendly challenger Aécio Neves in a runoff election Oct.
Brazil’s faltering economy will be high in voters’ minds when they return to the polls Oct.
26 for a second-round face-off in the country’s presidential election.
59% of votes cast in a first-round poll on October 5 — not quite enough to beat outright Aécio Neves, a business-friendly candidate who was twice governor of Minas Gerais state.
55% in the latest in a series of upsets in a volatile campaign.
Neves’ resurgence can partly be explained by the worrying state of the country’s economy.
2% in the first.
3% growth it had estimated in June.
In Brazil growth is very low.
This puts the advance of social programs at risk,” said Ricardo Ismael, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.
62%.
Many voters, especially those in the upper classes, see Neves as a safe pair of hands.
His Party for Brazilian Social Democracy ran Brazil from 1995-2002 under President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Cardoso had won a first-round vote in 1995 after the ‘Real Plan’ he coordinated as Finance Minister ended hyperinflation.
His government stabilized the economy and introduced much-needed economic reforms.
But the Left attacked the party’s privatizations of state companies and lack of focus on social policies.
5% in 2002.
They never put the poor in the budget.
All the social policies were restricted, made for few people,” Rousseff said.
Her party’s flagship income support program, the Bolsa Família, or ‘Family Purse,’ has lifted millions of Brazilians from poverty.
The president has said in campaigning her opponents would end it.
Neves countered with a broadside over the stagnant economy and a corruption scandal which has linked payments to politicians from the Workers’ Party and other coalition parties to inflated contracts from state-controlled oil company, Petrobras.
His program maintains the Bolsa Família.
Brazilians are very worried with the monsters of the present,” Neves said in a speech Monday.
Rousseff was initially favorite to win this election.
But when the Brazilian Socialist Party’s Eduardo Campos, a ‘third way’ candidate who was in third place in polls, was killed in a plane crash on Aug.
13, his running mate Marina Silva took his place, tripled his share, and was soon polling equal with Rousseff and ahead in a second round vote.
But Silva’s campaign faltered under a barrage of attacks from the Workers’ Party, and Neves was able to present himself as a stronger candidate for change, with a tough performance in the last two television debates.
He rode a last minute wave of support to second place.
32% of the vote, only slightly more than she achieved in the 2010 election, when she also finished third.
Brazilians also voted for governors, Congress and state assemblies.
The electors that were anti-Workers’ Party became more sympathetic to Aécio,” said Ismael, using the candidate’s first name, as is commonplace in Brazil.
Neves now has three weeks to prove his point.
But in a sign of widening voter apathy, 39 million Brazilians either abstained, or voted for nobody – more than the 35 million that voted for Neves.
2%.
Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, rode the success of her income redistribution programme to come out on top in a first-round election on Sunday, but failed to secure the overall majority needed to avoid a run-off.
7%.
3% – almost the same as she managed during her last attempt four years ago.
Once again the Brazilian people have honoured me with their trust by giving me a victory in the first round of this contest,” Rousseff said.
The election appeared to have been carried out peacefully as 143 million voters headed to polling stations everywhere from the Atlantic seaboard to deep inside the Amazon rainforest.
Some voters had to travel by boat for more than 12 hours to reach a polling booth, according to local media.
When the results were revealed, Workers party campaigners who had gathered outside a canvas screen set up in the street in central Rio cheered and celebrated with Samba classics, Antarctica beer and a barbecue, but the festivities were muted.
We’re happy, but we had hoped for more,” said Marcelo Rodrigues, coordinator of the union campaign in Rio.
Aécio will be a strong opponent.
Silva’s challenge came to nothing.
Until the previous day, most had been expecting a run-off against Silva, but, having toyed with change, the electorate eventually opted for the two main parties of left and right that have dominated Brazil politics for decades.
Coming a year after mass street protests that highlighted the high levels of frustration at the running of the country, the traditional outcome was a relatively mild surprise in an eventful campaign that has featured a huge corruption scandal at the country’s biggest oil company, Petrobras, the rising power of evangelical Christianity, and a row over a homophobic rant by one of the fringe candidates .
The election appeared to turn on its head in August, when the candidate for the Socialist party, Eduardo Campos, was killed in a plane crash .
His running-mate, Silva, benefited from a huge surge of sympathy to triple the party’s vote and lift them briefly into first place.
But the two main parties steady reasserted their strength by using their substantial advantages in TV time and campaign funding to attack Silva and press home their greater experience in the key area of running the economy.
Brazil voted largely against all that is wrong with the current government,” said Silva after the result.
Buoyed by a last-minute surge, the Neves team put more campaigners on the streets outside polling stations.
In downtown Rio, every parked car had at least Neves two pamphlets under their windscreen wipers, and temporary staff handed out cards to every passerby willing to take one.
At the polling station in the Colegio Angelorum school in Gloria, Rio de Janeiro eaarlier, in the day, several voters acknowledged that their opinions had shifted away from Silva in recent weeks.
I was going to vote for Marina, but she was terrible in the debates.
She looked very confused,” said Aline Blajchman, a community care worker who said she would support the Green candidate, Eduardo Jorge.
Of the dozen or so people approached by the Guardian, a majority said they would vote for Aécio, who has benefited from a strong performance in TV debates and the country’s biggest campaign machine.
He is the most capable and knowledgeable of the three candidates – the safest pair of hands,” said Silvana Cutrim, a shopkeeper.
Others expressed dissatisfaction with the three leading candidates, but – with voting obligatory under Brazilian law – said they would opt for continuity.
I will vote for Dilma.
She’s bad, but the others are worse,” said Jaime Souza, a vegetable stallholder.
The president is now in a strong position to secure a second term.
Surveys suggest she will win a second-round vote against Neves by 48% to 42%.
But momentum is on Neves’ side, and Silva could yet throw her support behind the challenger, so another surprise cannot be ruled out when the polls open again on 26 October.
Victory in this first round is thanks to the desire for change in the majority of the population,” said Neves.
As well as choosing from the 11 presidential candidates, voters selected 27 state governors, 513 congressmen, 1,069 regional lawmakers, and a third of the senate.
Among the winners is former national football team striker Romario, who gained a seat on the senate.
São Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin was re-elected despite criticism of his management of the worst drought in history.

Brazil s President and Workers  Party  PT  presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff reacts during a news conference after voting in the first round of election in Brasilia, October 5, 2014.
SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters  - A tight runoff campaign for Brazil s presidency kicked off on Monday with leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff and pro-business rival Aecio Neves racing to win over supporters of the third-placed candidate after she was knocked out of the election.
6 percent of the vote.
6 percent and they now face each other in an Oct.
26 runoff to decide Brazil s most unpredictable race in decades.
Rousseff remains a slight favorite as she has strong support among Brazil s poor but Neves is within striking distance and is expected to pick up most of the 21 percent of voters who backed the third-placed finisher, environmentalist Marina Silva.
Neves reached out to Silva on Monday, stressing the similarities of their proposals to reduce the size of government and free up private enterprise.
He said he was the candidate of change, a slogan dear to Silva who sought to end the horse-trading of Brazilian politics.
He also fired back at Rousseff, who said he represents the  ghosts of the past,  a reference to an austerity drive, layoffs and the privatization of state assets when his Brazilian Social Democracy Party, or PSDB, last held power from 1995-2002.
Neves said.
72 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day rise in more than three years, as investors were cheered by Neves  strong showing.
46 percent stronger.
Latin America s largest economy has been stuck in a rut for nearly four years under Rousseff, and most of Brazil s business community and Wall Street investors have made no secret of their desire for change.
Rousseff returned to the offensive on Monday in a campaign that is increasingly being drawn along class lines.
Investors don t win elections in Brazil.
She also attacked Neves  top economic policy advisor, former central bank president Arminio Fraga, saying that inflation went beyond the official target on his watch and interest rates hit 45 percent.
Both Rousseff and Neves will try to win over Silva s supporters.
She had soared in opinion polls earlier in the race and looked on track to win the election in a runoff.
Her support crumbled in the homestretch amid questions about her shifting views on major issues, but she is admired by many voters and could still help swing the election with an endorsement.
Top Rousseff aide Gilberto Carvalho said on Sunday night that he had already spoken to the head of Silva s Brazilian Socialist Party, Roberto Amaral, to ask for their support.
Carvalho told reporters.
Silva called both Rousseff and Neves on Monday but they said they did not raise the issue of her endorsement in the calls.
Silva s party will meet on Wednesday and a decision on whether to formally back a candidate in the runoff is expected by Thursday, party leaders said.
Most observers believe Rousseff has very little chance of winning formal backing from Silva, after unleashing a barrage of negative ads that contributed to her collapse.
Instead, her best hope may be for Silva to stay neutral, as she did after finishing third in the 2010 race, which could allow Rousseff to peel away her more left-leaning supporters.
The Silva and Neves camps shared broadly similar market-friendly platforms and Silva s campaign chief, Walter Feldman, is a former PSDB leader with enduring ties to the party.
The runoff will be a battle between opposing visions for Brazil: the state-led capitalism of the ruling Workers  Party, and the market-friendly policies promised by Neves and the PSDB.
The two parties are arch-rivals and between them they have run Brazil for the last 20 years.
Rousseff and her party accuse the PSDB of favoring the rich, a potent accusation in a country where more than half of voters live in households earning less than $1,000 a month.
Polls taken prior to Sunday showed Rousseff would beat Neves by as much as 8 percentage points in a runoff, although Neves  dramatic turnaround gives him clear momentum.
That could be important in a race in which most voters have told pollsters they want change from the government but many also have misgivings about kicking Rousseff out of power.
The first opinion polls for the runoff are expected on Thursday.
They could face greater scrutiny failed to project the scale of Neves  late first-round surge.
As recently as 10 days ago, polls showed him stuck in third place and trailing Silva by 9 percentage points.
But when Silva s lack of party support and reputation for unpredictable decisions scared away many voters at the last minute, Neves  consistent pro-business message and calm, presidential air won them over.
Expectations of a Rousseff victory had in recent days battered stocks and driven the currency to a five-year low.
Although markets snapped back on Monday, they are likely to be volatile over the next three weeks.
Despite falling investment, weak consumer confidence and a loss of competitiveness by Brazilian manufacturers, Rousseff and her supporters blame the economic woes on international instability, not her policies.
Unemployment has remained near historic lows, and wages have been steady.
To win, Neves may have to distance himself from the PSDB s last time in government, a period that saw important pro-market reforms but is remembered by most voters for high unemployment and painful budget cuts.
He must also convince voters that his promise to jumpstart the economy won t come at the expense of social programs, especially a popular monthly stipend that low-income families receive in exchange for keeping their children in schools.

Let’s hope business get’s the boot.
Capitalists destroyed Brazil and neighboring countries, enriching the few while heaping misery on the masses.
The damage is done by free spending socialists buying votes and then they blame their opposition for the trouble that their policies caused.
Typical of the modern Liberal.
The blame is never to be associated to their policies.
It is always some neblous evil outside force causing the damage.
Even when the damage is directly from their bad decisions.
Really, look at what socialism did in Venezuela and Argentina.
Peru, on the other hand, has been booming now that socialism departed.

TO DESCRIBE the final weeks of Brazil’s presidential campaign as dramatic would be putting it mildly.
There was tragedy, when Eduardo Campos, leader and candidate of the centrist Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB , perished in an aeroplane crash in mid-August.
There were tears: Marina Silva  pictured left , Mr Campos’s running-mate-turned-candidate, broke down after being criticised by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in whose cabinet she had once served as environment minister but whose protégée and successor, Dilma Rousseff  pictured centre , is seeking a second term.
This being Brazil, there was also scandal, as a former executive at Petrobras, the statecontrolled oil firm, alleged that politicians from Ms Rousseff’s left-wing Workers’ Party  PT  and some coalition allies were involved in a kickback scheme there.
The twists and turns have led to lots of head-scratching among pollsters and pundits.
With days to go before the first round of voting on October 5th, firm predictions are scarce.
Mauro Paulino, boss of Datafolha, a big polling company, says the way the campaign as a whole has unfurled is “incomparable”.
And not just with any prior Brazilian election, but with anything that has happened anywhere in the world, at least in living memory, according to José Toledo of Estadão Dados, a data website.
The prediction that commands most confidence is that Ms Rousseff will not secure an outright majority in the first round and that the election will go to a run-off on October 26th.
There she will almost certainly face Ms Silva, who in the weeks following Mr Campos’s death has surged past Aécio Neves  pictured right , the candidate of the centre-right Party of Brazilian Social Democracy  PSDB .
The latest second-round simulations show Ms Rousseff and Ms Silva running neck and neck.
For a while it looked as if Ms Silva would carry the run-off with ease.
At one point she enjoyed a double-digit lead over the incumbent in second-round polling.
A black environmentalist with a reputation for probity and the promise of breaking the PT-PSDB chokehold on power, she had already managed a solid third place in the presidential election of 2010, with 20m votes.
Then most voters craved continuity—and plumped for Ms Rousseff.
Now three-quarters clamour for change, giving Ms Silva a clear advantage over Ms Rousseff, who is weighed down by the PT’s decade in power, as well as piffling growth and shoddy public services decried by the 1m-plus protesters who took to the streets in June last year  see Bello  .
But the momentum has shifted in recent weeks.
Ms Silva’s surge spurred Ms Rousseff’s campaign into action.
João Santana, a formidable marketer who had helped both Ms Rousseff and Lula, as well as four foreign presidents, to get elected, threw the incumbent’s resources into “desacralising” the saintly Ms Silva.
Use of negative campaigning has been unprecedented, at least by Brazilian standards.
Felipe Borba of the State University of Rio de Janeiro has analysed the prominence of attack ads since direct presidential elections were introduced in 1989.
He found that on average just 3% of frontrunners’ free television time  allotted to candidates on the basis of the size of their electoral coalitions  was spent bashing rivals.
And in previous campaigns it was the usurper who would use attack ads to finger the incumbent’s failures.
Not this time.
Ms Rousseff boasts six times as much TV time as Ms Silva before the first round  the balance is much fairer in a second round  and may end up devoting as much as 15% of it to laying into her rival.
The ads have been brazen.
They allege that Ms Silva plans to cut social programmes  she doesn’t  and, by promising to grant the Central Bank autonomy  which Ms Rousseff has undermined , hand power to shady bankers.
The PT’s blitzkrieg has had an effect.
Ms Silva’s “rejection rate”, the percentage of voters who say they would never vote for her, now exceeds that of Mr Neves, though it remains ten points shy of Ms Rousseff’s  see chart .
Yet given the attacks, the PSB candidate might have been expected to collapse completely, says Mr Paulino.
In response, Ms Silva delivered a rhetorical masterstroke at a recent rally in the poor north-eastern state of Ceará.
Born to a family of indigent rubber-tappers in the Amazon region, she recalled how her mother would forgo meals so that her eight children could share one egg with a bit of salt, flour and onion.
Somebody who has lived through that would never end the Bolsa Família,” she said, referring to a popular cash-transfer scheme.
The clip was later disseminated in her TV ads.
There is still time for more fireworks.
A debate on Brazil’s most-watched television network on October 2nd will offer a chance to shine for Ms Silva, whose on-screen performances have been more assured than the president’s.
But the truth is that victory will be hard for Ms Silva without the PSDB’s explicit blessing in a second round.
Some PSDB bigwigs, including José Serra, who lost to Ms Rousseff four years ago, and Fernando Henrique Cardoso, president from 1995 to 2002 and Mr Neves’s political mentor, have hinted at a possible accommodation.
Others are wary of backing a third-party candidate, fearful that it could trigger a slide into irrelevance.
Half of Mr Neves’s voters currently plan to migrate to Ms Silva in the second round, according to IBOPE, a pollster.
That is three times as many as would go to the incumbent—but down from two-thirds at the end of August.
The battle for Brazil is going down to the wire.
Wall Street woke up feeling a little sad this morning, for its favorite candidate in Brazil’s presidential election, Marina Silva, placed third.
This means the second-round vote, scheduled later this month on October 26, will be between the incumbent Workers Party candidate Dilma Rousseff and the neoliberal technocrat Aécio Neves.
Rousseff is, as of now, favored to win.
Over the last two months, financial markets made it clear they wanted Silva to be the next president of Brazil.
They really, really wanted her.
A month ago, when Silva was unexpectedly rising in the polls, predicted to win, Brazil’s stock market soared, rising nearly 7 percent.
Investors goosed Brazil’s real, for a short time making it “ the world’s best performing major currency in the three weeks after Silva announced her candidacy on Aug.
But then Rousseff rebounded in the polls and the love disappeared.
Last week, the wolves of Wall Street exercised their “veto,” punishing both Brazil’s currency and stock market.
The real tumbled to the lowest it’s been in six years and stocks suffered their worst one-day plunge in three years.
Brazilians are used to this sort of thing.
It happened every time Dilma’s predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, ran for the presidency  1989, 1994, and 1998  until, in the 2002 contest he finally won, he signed a pledge to the International Monetary Fund that he’d maintain a budget surplus and not renege on foreign debt.
This time, though, it wasn’t enough to save Silva.
English-language readers  like actor Mark Ruffalo, who supported Silva until he learned that she was an evangelical Christian who opposed same-sex marriage  might be excused for thinking she had a shot.
All the tribunes of the finance capitalism—such as The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times—had breathlessly lined up behind her, and none more so than The Economist.
Under headlines such as “ The Silva Surger ,” “ The Measure of Marina ,” and “ The Times They are A’Changing ,” the magazine sold her virtues.
Marina Silva is impressive.
Born into a dirt-poor family of rubber tappers in an Amazonian backwater, Silva is of African descent and would have been the first person of color to lead Brazil.
As Lula’s minister of the environment, she had a good record slowing Amazon deforestation and promoting a class-based environmentalism that recognized that the rainforest is a place where poor people live and work.
But in this election, she distanced herself from her activist past and aligned with Brazil’s agricultural and financial industries.
Brazil’s political culture is complicated, to say the least.
One needs be cautious mapping a left-right continuum on to it, especially one based on United States politics.
There are many committed activists who have broken with the PT over corruption and economic policy and will abstain in the second round.
And Silva’s fall undoubtedly had something to do with the least progressive of motives: racism.
Silva though did come broadly to represent “the right,” at least in economic terms, promising tight budgets, high interest rates  to keep the bond markets happy , and the prospect of aligning Brazil more closely with US trade.
Maybe.
In addition to Brazil’s upcoming run-off, important elections are coming up in Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia—and only in the latter is the left assured a victory.
But for now—assuming Rousseff wins—it looks like the largest economy in the region and the seventh-largest in the world will continue to be governed by the Workers Party  PT .
A second term for Rousseff will be especially important in the realm of international affairs.
Since coming to power in 2003 with Lula, the PT has steered a foreign policy fairly independent of Washington.
It’s not Havana in the 1960s seeding insurgent movements throughout Latin America or in the 1970s sending tens of thousands of troops into southern Africa to overthrow Washington-backed white supremacy.
And it hasn’t been confrontational.
It’s not Hugo Chávez standing up in the UN and waving away George W.
Bush’s lingering smell of sulfur.
But as the region’s economic center of gravity and an important member of the so-called BRIC countries, Brazil has been absolutely indispensable in countering Washington on trade, war and surveillance.
At the United Nations, for instance, in 2004, Brazil and Argentina took the unprecedented step of sharing the two-year seat reserved for temporary Latin American members of the Security Council  Brazil sat the first year, Argentina the second .
The cooperation has continued.
Argentina currently holds the seat and Brazil backed its efforts to slow down Washington’s rush to war in Syria  that is, the first time around, in the fall of 2013 .
And it has worked with Germany to promote a General Assembly resolution on “ The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age ,” meant to rein in NSA snooping.
Brazil also passed a similar national “Bill of Digital Rights” law  Forbes complains that the law is “breaking the internet,” while one of the pioneers of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, says the law will “unleash a new era—in which the rights of citizens in all countries are protected” .
The diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks a few years ago give a good window onto how Brazilian diplomats gently derailed the United States’ hemispheric agenda; often times, Washington’s envoys were long out of the room before they realized they had been played.
Lula recognized Palestine’s claim to a state within its 1967 borders and Dilma spoke out against Israel’s disproportionate use of force in its recent assault on Gaza.
Earlier this year, the Obama administration had hoped to get the Organization of American States to slap Venezuela, over its government’s response to street protests.
But Dilma knows a double standard when she sees one.
In 2013, she faced protests significantly more massive than anything taking place in Venezuela, against which her security forces reacted brutally .
Brazil, though, got no grief from Washington.
So she defended Venezuela: “Venezuela has its own history.
It’s not Brazil’s role to tell it what to do, since that would violate our foreign policy.
Brazil is constantly assailed by US pundits for failing to “uphold UN principles,” or the values of the OAS, by not joining the jackals to go after the enemy of the moment is, be it Venezuela, Libya, Syria or Russia.
In fact, not doing so is precisely to uphold the founding principles of those organizations, including non-aggression, multilateralism and sovereignty.
Venezuela is currently running unopposed to take the non-permanent Security Council seat reserved for Latin America, reflecting a regional unity that would have been put in jeopardy with a Silva win  her foreign policy platform called for much closer relations with the United States on trade and security .
Brazil, for sure, has its own interests.
The country cooperates with Argentina at the UN, but it wants its own permanent seat on the Security Council.
And Rousseff, dealing with economic problems and social demands at home, has kept a lower profile than Lula and works with Washington, compromising when need be  some felt the UN privacy resolution was watered down .
But there is no doubt that Hillary Clinton, imagining what her foreign policy will be when she enters the White House, would rather have had Marina Silva  not to mention Neves  than Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia.


Sao Paulo, Brazil  CNN  -- Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff won a hotly contested runoff election on Sunday.
59% of the vote, according to official results.
41%.
Neves said he called to congratulate Rousseff, who thanked voters on Twitter late Sunday for their support.
The election was one of the tightest competitions in recent years.
Before becoming the country s first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers  Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva.
She claims that under the presidencies of her predecessor and herself, masses of Brazilians have risen out of poverty.
Rousseff, 66, presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil.
She took a lot of political flack over how public money was spent.
The President defeated Neves, a 54-year-old economist, who is a well-known name and a career politician.
The pro-business candidate belongs to the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, one of the country s strongest.

We are working right now with the chances of a Dilma re-election in the order of about 50%,” says Raphael Juan, fund manager at BBT Asset in São Paulo.
If recent jeers by FIFA World Cup soccer fans for incumbent Dilma Rousseff is any indication of what will play out in October, it is likely she will have to plead her case in a second round of voting.
In Brazil, a president can only be elected if he or she receives 51% of the popular vote.
If not, it goes into a run-off vote between the top two candidates.
Financial markets hate uncertainty.
Even though Brazilian equities have been outperforming ever major market since FIFA came to town on June 6, investors are looking at the polls — not the soccer pitch — to gauge political risk in the economy.
Juan outlines three scenarios between the three rivals.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff will likely win, whether Brazil wins the World Cup or not.
If Dilma wins, foreign investment and the stock market will decline, even though foreign investment will still be high by comparison to other years.
There will be very little movement on interest rates because they are close aligned with inflation and growth.
40 and the equity markets will likely end the year around 5% higher than last year.
But in the mid-term  until elections , the Bovespa should trend higher.
Aécio Neves of the PSDB party, nicknamed the Tucans, or Tucanos in Portuguese, wins and puts his social democratic party back in business.
PSDB ran Brazil for 8 years under ex-Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and then lost to Workers’ Party front man Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Brazil has been run by the Workers’ Party for 12 years.
If Aécio brings back the Tucanos to the Presidential Palace, “foreign investment, particularly speculative capital, should increase while foreign direct investment should remain unchanged.
Interest rates will likely go up because a new Finance Minister will be more rigorous in attacking inflation.

Aécio Neves, Brazilian senator from Minas Gerais state.
If the election goes to Eduardo Campos and his sidekick VP Marina Silva, a former heavy weight within the Workers’ Party, the scenario will be “identical to that of Neves.
Silva is a former Environmental Minister.

Everyone speculates on what a Brazil victory in the World Cup means for Dilma.
But win or lose will have very little impact.

Not really a front runner, but if she was, left-wing environmentalist Marina Silva would be giving Dilma a serious run for her money.
In the short run, some companies will benefit from the legacy of FIFA, yet the bigger challenge facing Brazil is slow growth and persistently high inflation over 6%.
The market is looking for a new direction in monetary and fiscal policy.
No one on the Street cares if Brazil wins the World Cup.
But an early World Cup exit would add to the overall disillusionment facing the current government.
Dilma’s administration is already under pressure from the Brazilian people as public funds have been spent on hosting the games — something Lula said would not happen — rather than being invested on infrastructure and other social projects.
The good news is that despite around $12 billion spent on new stadiums and some transportation investments, Brazil did manage to increase its budget for health and education, a sign that Dilma has been listening to the protesters.
For us as stock-pickers, the state of the economy is of secondary importance.
The most important thing is that businesses remain well run, generating strong cash flows that can be returned to shareholders,” says  Aberdeen Asset Management&#039;s Aberdeen Asset Management&#039;s Senior Investment Manager Fiona Manning.
Meanwhile, here’s what history tells us about the political outcomes after World Cup wins and losses.
Okay, here is the short of it…it’s completely random.
In 1994, Cardoso was elected and Brasilia changed political parties.
Brazil won the World Cup against Italy 3 to 2.
In 1998, Cardoso was re-elected but Brazil lost the World Cup to France 3 to zip.
Then in 2002, PSDB put up São Paulo politician José Serra to go against Lula.
Brazil won the World cup against Germany 2 to 0 and PSDB was replaced by a new party.
In 2006, Lula won again, and Brazil did not even make it to the finals.
And lastly, in 2010, Brazil failed to make it to the finals, but the Workers’ Party stayed in power with Lula’s hand picked successor, Dilma.
What can strongly impact Dilma in her re-election bid will be how the event plays out this month: the protests, the problems with infrastructure at the stadiums, public safety and other problems that will get blamed on her.
If there are a lot of problems up until the end of the Cup, even if Brazil ends up winning, the negativity and the discontent among the population will be reflected in the  poll  numbers,” says Juan.
But, if there are no problems between now and the end of the World Cup, even if Brazil is eliminated, there will be no impact at the polls,” Juan says.
Seriously, you believe in polls?
In a country like Brazil polls invariably lie in order to try to manipulate the masses.
I sincerely hope that Aécio will win.
Get rid o PT along with Lula and his two girls Marina and Dilma.
Too much corruption; excessive corruption.
Enough, already!
Problem is that Dilma and her party are against capitalism; company owners and market don’t trust them.
Her economic actions was a failury,in the first turn, in consequence, we have very low growth rate, high level of government expenditure and inflation without control.

Brazil s presidential race will go to a second round after incumbent Dilma Rousseff fell short of an outright victory in Sunday s election.
She received 42% of the vote and will face centre-right rival Aecio Neves , who won 34%, on 26 October.
In a surprise result, prominent environmentalist Marina Silva got only 21% despite being a favourite at one stage, and is now out of the race.
Analysts now predict a tight contest as both candidates seek to pick up votes.
Reacting to the result Ms Rousseff - who has served one four-year term as president - said people had expressed their rejection of  the ghosts of the past, recession and unemployment , and vowed to continue to work for change.
I clearly understood the message from the streets and from the ballot boxes.
Ms Rousseff, who heads the left-wing Workers  Party  PT .
Mr Neves, 54, a senator and former governor of Minas Gerais state, called on Ms Silva s supporters to back him, saying he represented  hope for change .
It was the economy that was on most Brazilians  minds as they cast their votes.
President Dilma Rousseff has blamed Brazil s economic woes on the global financial crisis.
While to a certain extent that is true, it is not the whole picture.
The social welfare programmes introduced by the Workers  Party have helped lift millions of Brazilians out of poverty, but critics would say that came at a price.
Which is where Aecio Neves comes in.
He says Brazil needs to be more attractive to business to encourage investment.
After all, if there s no economic growth, where does the money come from for the social spending?
He wants a more independent central bank too - that way stubbornly high inflation can be reined in, something President Rousseff and her interventionist government disagree with.
The past 12 years have seen Brazil s fortunes change but people aren t worried about the past, they re concerned about the future.
We will have to wait another three weeks to find out who Brazilians trust more in that respect.
Ms Silva, 56, said she and other Socialist leaders would meet in the coming days to discuss any endorsements for the run-off.
Sao Paulo.
More than 142 million people were eligible to vote on Sunday.
Voting is mandatory for those aged between 18 and 70, and turnout was 80%.
Brazilians also elected members of congress and regional governors on Sunday.
At the end of a dramatic campaign, Brazilians are still really no closer to knowing who will lead the world s seventh-largest economy.
Although there are now two distinct visions for the future of Brazil - Aecio Neves s business-friendly image or the paternalistic interventionism of Dilma Rousseff - whoever persuades voters that they can provide a bit of both might well win the ultimate prize.
After a brief respite to gather breath, the second round is likely to take a nastier, more confrontational tone.
Ms Rousseff will portray her opponent as a privatising businessman who will cut hitherto comprehensive social welfare programmes.
Likewise, Mr Neves will paint the incumbent as an idealistic socialist who will burden the country with more state spending and drive the economy into the ground.
The other main candidate, Marina Silva, fell away dramatically after having been favourite at one stage.
A former environmental campaigner, she was damaged by the more powerful campaigns of her opponents.
They will need some of her votes if either is to win on 26 October.
Early in the campaign, 66-year-old incumbent Ms Rousseff had been expected to win outright.
However, the race changed when Ms Silva became the Socialist candidate following the death in an air crash of original hopeful Eduardo Campos.
Last month Ms Silva was riding high in opinion polls and appeared likely to reach a second round.
However her popularity later slipped as she faced concerted attacks on her ability from Ms Rousseff s campaign.
The election results have surprised many in Brazil, the BBC s Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro says.
In the end, most people voted for traditional parties - the PT and Mr Neves  Social Democrats  PSDB .
She adds that the main issue now is who can be trusted to revive the economy.
During Ms Rousseff s tenure as president, unemployment has been lower than under any of her predecessors, at about 5%.
The minimum wage has risen and the number of undernourished Brazilians has been falling.
But the past 18 months have been marred by recession and corruption scandals, and protests over poor public services and the World Cup costs.
Can a new government allay Brazil s economic woes?
Brazilian markets plunged more than 5 percent to seven-month lows after the open on Monday as investors expressed disappointment over Dilma Rousseff s victory in Sunday s runoff vote.
6 percent of votes in what has been called one of the closest campaigns in Brazil s history.

Investors hoped that a Neves victory would yield much-needed reforms on the welfare, fiscal and labor fronts, and see Brazil shift from consumption-led growth to investment-driven growth.
Will Rousseff change?
Capital Economics doesn t expect Rousseff to make any breakthroughs in tackling high inflation and Brazil s deteriorating fiscal position.
This could result in 2 percent annual growth, roughly half of what the group believes economies at Brazil s stage of development should be able to achieve.
The reforms that are needed means shifting income from ordinary workers - which form Dilma s core support - to companies.
This in turn will require her to take on vested interests within her political base.

Investor confidence is key to Brazil s economic recovery, and Rousseff s administration may alter administrative practices to improve investment appetite, according to Societe Generale.
However, the bank doesn t expect any overwhelming changes unless strong market moves or external events, such as Federal Reserve policy action, sway the government.
Sacha Tihanyi, Senior Currency Strategist at Scotiabank, explains his bearish outlook for Brazil s financial markets after the re-election of President Dilma Rousseff.
The failure to initiate reforms—particularly in sectors like infrastructure, fiscal and labor market—could keep the economy in a low growth and high inflation regime for a prolonged period.

On the bright side, reports that Finance Minister Guido Mantega is due to step down in December and will be replaced by a more pro-business personality are expected to help ease concerns over the country s fiscal plight.
Investors are exaggerating the impact of Rousseff s re-election on the economy, Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services, told CNBC on Monday.
Brazil is coming out of a recession that was due to high inflation, low commodity prices and general industrial uncompetitiveness.
Moreover, Adams added that politicians will have little control over declining global commodity prices, which are expected to cause major trade shocks to the South American economy.

Allegations of endemic political corruption dominated the end of campaigning    as Brazil voted in the closest presidential election in recent decades on    Sunday.
Supporters of both the ruling Workers’ Party of President Dilma Rousseff and    the opposition Brazilian Social Democratic Party  PSDB  claimed theirs was a    vote against dishonesty and malpratice, which has mired the government and    dominated the campaign in the past month.
President Rousseff, whose rule has been soured by an ailing economy and a wave    of protests in the last year, and her opponent Aécio Neves went into the    vote neck and neck in the polls with experts saying it was too close to    call.
In the run-up, Ms Rousseff faced difficult questions over an investigation    into money laundering within the state-owned oil and gas company Petrobras.
Meanwhile, the electorate also kept in mind the Mensalão vote-buying scandal    that emerged at the end of her predecessor Lula da Silva’s term.
On Friday, just two days before the vote, allegations that both “Lula” and “Dilma” knew about money being siphoned from Petrobras to fund the Workers’ Party were carried by Veja, one of the country’s biggest current affairs    magazines.
In the capital city of Brasília, voters said yesterday that corruption had    been the key issue in the campaign.
Edvao Gomes Viana, 38, a computer technician, said he voted for opposition    challenger Mr Neves as a statement for change.
The Workers’ Party cannot give anything more,” he said.
But Ms Rousseff’s supporters believe she will come good on the promises she    made to end corruption when she took office in 2010.
Many also pointed to improvements in quality of life for the poor under the    Workers’ Party.
José Raimundo Soares, 47, a street vendor, and his 18-year-old son Carlos both    voted for Ms Rousseff.
Brazil s President Dilma Rousseff embraces with Brazil s former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as they celebrate the results of the elections in a hotel in Brasilia on Sunday.
Brazil s left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race the nation has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, batting down a pro-business candidate s strong showing in a bitterly fought campaign.
5 per cent of the ballots counted.
Rousseff said.
She added that she  thanks from the bottom of my heart, our No. 1 militant, President Lula,  as the former leader used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.
Rousseff s victory extends the rule of her party, which has held the presidency since 2003.
During that time, they ve enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the leader now faces the daunting task of sparking a moribund economy that s underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,  said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil s leading think tank.  Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control.
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps — those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
Aecio Neves, presidential candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, left,  gives his concession speech next to his wife Leticia Weber, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, on Sunday.
Rousseff and Neves fought bitterly to convince voters that they can deliver on both growth and social advances.
This year s campaign is widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Neves had hammered at Rousseff over a widening kickback scandal Petrobras, with an informant telling investigators that the Workers  Party directly benefited from the scheme.
Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.
Rousseff said before voting in southern Brazil.
In Brazil s biggest city of Sao Paulo, hundreds of Workers  Party supporters gathered on a main avenue, waving banners as a truck with giant speakers blasted Rousseff s campaign jingles.
I m very happy because I think the construction of Brazil has barely begun and now we will have continuity,  said Liliane Viana, a 56-year-old retired federal government worker.  I was afraid we were going to move backward.
Supporters of Brazil s President and Workers  Party  PT  presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff react to the results of the Brazil general elections on Sao Paulo s Paulista Avenue.
Neves was a two-term governor in Minas Gerais state who left office in 2010 with a 92 percent approval rating.
He surged at the end of the presidential race to score a surprise second-place position and force a runoff vote against Rousseff.
Speaking from his hometown of Belo Horizonte, he thanked the  more than 50 million Brazilians  who voted for him.
I will be eternally grateful to each and every one of you who allowed me to dream again of the construction of a new project,  he said.  I fought the good fight.

In September, it appeared certain that incumbent president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, would struggle in a second round run-off vote with Marina Silva, a petite firebrand and one of the former stars of Dilma’s Workers’ Party.
While this election is likely to go to a second round run-off, and possibly pitting Marina vs Dilma in an ex-Workers’ Party vs Workers’ Party bid for the presidency, Dilma has some power in her corner now.
That power isn’t Workers’ Party strongman Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was and still is one of Brazil’s favorite politicians.
He has been relatively quiet this election season.
What Dilma has in her corner is a better country.
Simply put, after 12 years of Workers’ Party rule, Brazil is better.
Poll results ahead of Sunday’s first round of voting suggests that Brazilians see that.
According to an Ibope poll, Dilma has 46% of the vote, while Marina is down to 27% and third place rival Aecio Neves has 22%.
A second round of voting is required if no one receives 51% of the popular vote in the first round.
Brazil incumbent Dilma Rousseff has good stats on her side, and better discourse on the economic front that could propel her to victory either Sunday or in a second election on Oct.
26.
Forget the insider baseball rhetoric of political rivalries: Who would God vote for?
Is this one or that one gay?
All of that is irrelevant nonsense.
All Dilma has to do to win is remind Brazilians that Brazil is better.
They don’t care if the Bovespa is up 10% or down.
They care about having a job, potable water, and access to quality healthcare to name a few issues of importance.
According to a recent household survey by IBGE, the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics, educational attainment levels continue to rise; middle incomes are rising, but the poor are doing better than ever; digital inclusion is improving; access to healthcare is improving.
6%.
4% were attending school full-time in 2013.
Brazil achieved its lowest recorded rate of illiteracy, and the number of children aged 4 and 5 years old attending pre-school increased from 78% in 2012 to 81% in 2013, according to the study.
The average years each Brazilian spends in school continues to grow, and is now increasing at a rate of almost two years of study per decade.
When you think about it, this is exactly what the protests were about in Brazil over the last year.
Brazilians clamoring for better public services, more investment in school and less investment in soccer stadiums.
On one had, public services in Brazil have a lot of room for improvement.
On the other hand, they are improving.
There were a few mistakes in the survey, which the media and rival parties pounced on to promote the story that IBGE was working to make Brazil look flawless in order to give Dilma a boost.
Still, the facts remain: Brazil is better now than it was 12 years ago.
Despite a weaker economy, Brazilians are not going hungry.
Investors are not filing out of the country in droves.
This is not the 1990s.
Brazil is not Argentina.
A Better Economy, Too?
Marina’s late summer  winter in Brazil  surge surprised everyone.
Despite the fact that she has changed political parties three times, and is a member of the Socialist party, the market seemed fine with a Marina win.
Barclays Capital economist Marcelo Salomon was even playing with the idea that Marina was going to be Brazil’s second female president.
But what guys like Salomon were really looking forward to was changes to economic policy.
No matter who wins, changes are coming.
Dilma is not going to play a one-note samba in a second term should she get there.
Dilma told reporters last month that, if re-elected, there would be a shake up in her cabinet.
The market took that as a sign beleaguered Finance Minister Guido Mantega would not return to his post.
A figurehead in the Workers’ Party, Mantega will likely stay within Dilma’s inner-circle, but removing him from the Finance Ministry and replacing him with a market favorite would likely seal her victory in the second round.
So far there are no hints as to who might replace Mantega.
No matter who challenges Dilma in the second round, Marina or Neves, both will need to produce a genie from a big investment bank in their corner in order to have a chance now.
S.
Dilma, says Vladimir Signorelli, global economist for Bretton Woods Research, a top down investment research firm based in Long Valley, New Jersey.
The Bovespa’s weakness since September is tied to high interest rates; the failure by the Brazilian central bank to establish a floor on currency weakness during the last several weeks of global risk aversion and finally, the strong dollar.
Further strengthening of the dollar is creating a deflationary headwind for commodity sensitive emerging markets like Brazil.
The dollar’s recent strength is a negative for Brazil’s financial market, regardless of who wins.
Since July 1, the gold price has fallen nearly 10%, while oil has fallen 15% and the Commodities Index has fallen more than 10%.
Traditionally, such deflationary pressures have been a headwind for Brazilian equities.
Dilma’s political comeback has been built on pivoting away from anti-growth, austerian moves.
Marina, meanwhile, has signaled the wrong kind of policies in recent weeks and has lost elite support in the polls.
46 to 1, it’s weakest level since the 2008-09 financial crisis .
She also said the Central Bank should be more rigorous on inflation, currently and stubbornly over 6%.
To market watchers, Marina is essentially campaigning as a rate-hiker, whereas Dilma, at the least, suggests interest rates should stay the same and the Brazilian real should be stronger, not weaker.
It is on this issue that Dilma has been winning over voters with money in the market.
She has already won over at least half of the country just for being the Workers’ Party candidate, a party that has helped Brazil improve over its 12 years in power.
It is not perfect, but it is better, and Dilma also has that fact in her corner Sunday.
As a result, Dilma is now within striking distance of even winning Sunday’s first round outright.
That is a rarity in Brazil, but a second round challenger will have a harder time now than people perceived a month ago.
Wouldn’t necessarily disagree that Brazil – on paper, anyway – is somewhat better than it was 12 years ago, but I’m not sure it had much to do with the PT, Lula or Dilma – and that’s the real issue, for me.
As I see it, FHC started the ball rolling, and no amount of mismanagement would have stopped that ball picking up snow, but which fundamentals have changed, exactly?
It seems to me that Brazil stands on the edge of a precipice caused by serial uselessness, and the PT could well be the machine that drives it over the edge.
A change  arguably any change  might do the trick, where stasis is probably the last thing we need.
In any case, as you well know, the public will flock to anyone who gives them a wee bit of cash, and they still lovingly remember Lula casting his pearls before the swine.
This will, regrettably, probably be the clincher – and we’ll be back again with the usual corruption, incompetence, bureaucracy, inefficiency and all the same dysfunctional systems so beloved of Brazil.
I’d go and drown my sorrows, but alcohol is banned until after 18:00.
I’m sure this will make all the difference, Ken.
I said in various articles that PSDB started the ball rolling.
Wow.
It is utterly shocking to read such a lousy piece from Forbes regarding Brazilian politics.
Dilma and the PT party have been the most corrupt and economically stifling governments in decades in Brazil.
If you took a poll from your readership or even by those with a college degree I think you would find 85% support this view.
Dilma and Lula have ridden on the coat tails of the economic and fiscal policies put into place by Fernando Henrique Cardoso  1995-2003  and have delivered a thoroughly lackluster political service alongside one of the most scandalous and corrupt periods in Brazilian history.
As a financial publication, you might find it interesting that the BOVESPA is up over 7% this morning!
Show me the poll.
It was written by a bunch of people that know pretty much about economy.
Although I agree with a lot of it Philippe, it’s actually not a manifesto – just a list of complaints!
There are a whole lot of things that need to be fixed, but no-one has a magic wand, and not enough people care about or understand what is at stake  see recent comment from another Dilma voter .
People with more immediate needs will still gravitate to those who appear to offer – or to have offered int he past – a quick fix.
Honestly, if I hear one more person banging on with that vacant, cow-eyed look about the “wonderful” bolsa familia without being able to see its potential for creating as many problems as it solves, I think I will scream!
I didnt read it.
I swore if I ever heard that again Id take a shot of 51 while standing on my head.
Let’s not forget just how important Bolsa Familia is or was when it was revamped under Lula.
I know…I Know…its a PSDB program.
Okay.
Tucanos are smart.
Petistas are morons who drink Pitu.
I get it.
Remember all the Brazilians in the middle classes that would shrink in their seats in front of an American or European whenever those cultures made the slightest comment about all the poverty in Brazil.
Like, “Wow…Rio is beautiful, but so many poor BLACK people all over the place.
The North Northeast of Brazil was compared to AFRICA…and not too long ago either.
Like 2001-02.
So Bolsa Familia made it that those people are no longer living life like people in the Congo.
More of them have potable water than ever before.
More ofthem have jobs.
More of them are educated.
All of their children are in school FULL TIME in order to receive the federal aid money.
All of their children are vaccinated against simple diseases so the strain on the poor public healthcare system in that region is less.
All of this was necessary to bring the poor northern half of the country in line with the poor in the southern half of the country.
A poor Gaucho was like a millionaire compared to a poor Baiano and everyone knows it.
This was not too long ago either.
So yes, as Fraga says over and over again…it would be better if less people in the north were on federal assistance.
But it would also be better if Haiti didnt get hit with so many earthquakes.
Or if the legacy of slavery didnt leave so many blacks in one place with shit to do for the rest of their lives but sit and steer at the heatwaves off the sertao.
But it is what it is, isn’t it?
It would be better if Brazilians in the north east didnt need Bolsa Familia.
But they still do.
IN SPITE OF the fact that the economy there is growing faster than it is in the south.
If Bolsa Familia was growing, and the economies of the northern states were shrinking, we’d have a problem.
But Fraga’s analysis is wrong because even though Bolsa Familia is still growing strong and perhaps with a growign number of people on its roster, the northern states are stronger than they were a decade ago.
There are more jobs and more money there than ever in history.
And the poor in the north saw their incomes rise more than anyone anywhere, and this in a world where the 1% see their income rise more than anyone anywhere.
Not in the north northeast.
In that respect, Bolsa Familia is more good than bad.
PT over the last decade .
You might even be right about the 85%, but the problem is that this is amongst an educated minority.
The election is more likely to be won by an uneducated majority, who couldn’t give a rat’s ass about any of this high-brow stuff.
Whatever else it may or may not have done, the PT has been infinitely more successful at getting the poor on their side.
And unless you can dangle hard cash, free food or white goods in front of them, they’re probably always going to vote for President Squid and his cohorts  no matter what they might tell you a few minutes before they go into the booth .
Never mind – let’s see what Aécio and maybe the vestiges of the Marina protest voters can do between them.
It’s not quite over yet, and we should always look on the bright side of life  cue song .
And NO political party fixed it.
PSDB worked on it, but the debt bomb from the pre- Real Plan years made their work nearly impossible.
PT took the torch and ran with it.
Now the poor are outnumbered by the brazilian middle class for the first time in history.
PTs watch, like it or not.
Now that is improving.
Is PT more corrupt than PMDB or PSDB?
I dont know.
I think Neves would make a fine president.
FHC was a great president.
But lets not pretend that Lula and PT were pieces of shit over the last decade because they were not.
It is not even remotely arguable that brazil became part of the world stage and the world conversation under Lula’s watch.
You’re right, Clive Maguire, the poor people are on Dilma’s side just because they are ignorant.
I hope you’re right Cristina.
Go Aécio!
You elitist scumbag.
You call poor people “ignorant” just because they took side of who looks for them?
You’re right, Clive Maguire.
Poor people is on Dilma’s side because they are ignorant.
He cant win without Marina support.
And he is apparently getting more of it than Dilma is.
I dont know if you’re being naive or if u just choosing to ignore the truth.
Im not a fan of PT neither PSDB.
Kinda dislike both parties the same.
However, despite all the corruption cases presented during PT’s watch, you gotta remember that, under FHC watch, we had the record of corruption cases rejected and swept under the rug.
Don’t get me wrong, i also think FHC was a great president, despite his flaws, as well as i dont think PT is the monster some people are trying to make.
I do know for sure one thing, Aécio was such a bad Governor for my state that, not only i refused to vote for him, as well as most of our state chose to do the same.
He LOST to Dilma in his own home.
That says a lot about him.
If FHC was the one challenging Dilma, id prolly choose him.
Since he’s not, ill have to stick with Dilma.
Make that Caipirinha a double today if you invest in Brazil.
Brazilian stocks plummeted Monday after President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won a re-election against Aecio Neves, a pro-business candidate that many in the investment community hoped could lift the country out of its economic malaise.
Brazil s Bovespa Stock Index   IBOV   fell by 4% while the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF   EWZ  , which tracks a broad range of the country s companies, dove over 6%.
In more bad news, New York-listed shares of Brazilian energy giant Petrobras   PBR   tanked 15%.
Craig Botham, the emerging markets economist at Schroder s Investment Management.
The election results have broad implications for the Brazil s economy, which is South America s largest.
The country is marred by feeble growth, high inflation, and a widening debt load.
Many Brazilians were optimistic that hosting the World Cup last summer would provide a windfall of tourism dollars that could aid its financial situation.
But the event became divisive as the government spent billions on brand new stadiums even as poverty continued to plague Brazil s favelas, or shanty towns.
One stadium was built in a far flung region that abuts the Amazon jungle, which critics argued would have little use after the cup.
Brazil s plight is a sharp reversal from previous years when the nation was a darling of emerging markets investors.
But economic mismanagement and slumping commodity prices have sent it spiraling downwards.
The numbers don t look good.
3% in 2014.
And in March, Standard and Poor s downgraded Brazil s long term sovereign bonds to just one notch above junk status.
Brazil s currency, the real, has dropped 12% against the dollar in the past three months.
The nail-bitingly close election in many ways showcased a country at a crossroads.
Rousseff, at one point a Marxist rebel who was allegedly tortured in the 1970s during Brazil s former dictatorship, ran on a social platform of helping the poor.
She is credited with keeping unemployment low and improving the economic circumstances of many of the nation s neediest citizens.
But a growing middle class has also become more conservative, claims Kohli.
That gave Neves, an economist, a big bump as voters became more concerned with the health of the overall economy.
Kohli.
Brazil s economy is in tough shape, as were its soccer fans last summer after the country s loss in the World Cup finals.

No candidate in Brazil s presidential election won an outright first round victory, so the top two contenders will face each other in a run-off on 26 October.
Who will be facing whom?
With almost all the votes in the first round counted, incumbent Dilma Rousseff of the Workers  Party had a solid lead with about 42% of the vote.
She will be joined in the run-off by Aecio Neves of the centre-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB , who got 34% of the vote.
Environmentalist Marina Silva, who until recently had been leading in pre-election opinion polls, is out of the running after only getting 21% of the vote.
Why has the election been so unpredictable?
Until mid-August, the election appeared to be heading for a predictable outcome: most opinion polls indicated a clear lead for Ms Rousseff with Mr Neves coming second.
But the sudden fatal accident of the third-ranked candidate, Eduardo Campos of the Socialist Party, injected a big dose of unpredictability.
Mr Campos was replaced by his running-mate, Marina Silva, and a sudden outpouring of grief and sympathy catapulted her into first place in the opinion polls.
For weeks, polls predicted a run-off between Ms Silva and Ms Rousseff, leaving Aecio Neves trailing a distant third.
But a late surge for Mr Neves means the battle for the presidency will now be fought between the two parties which have dominated Brazilian politics since the country returned to democracy three decades ago.
Why did Marina Silva fall behind?
Marina Silva enjoyed a surge in popularity after her nomination by the Brazilian Socialist Party in the wake of the death of Mr Campos.
Her campaign battle cry of  change  captured the imagination of many Brazilians fed up with persistent corruption scandals.
Her humble upbringing - she grew up in a poor family of rubber tappers in the Amazon - and her mixed-race background set her apart from the other candidates.
But some people within the Socialist Party questioned her commitment to their party s policies, pointing out Ms Silva had changed affiliation four times in five years.
An about-turn on her pledge to back gay marriage further alienated voters from the gay and lesbian community and their supporters.
Others who liked her message of change were concerned her evangelical religion would stand in the way of changing Brazil s restrictive abortion legislation .
Ms Silva - an environmentalist - had also worried many within the green movement when she appeased Brazil s powerful agribusiness sector by expressing support for GM crops and agriculture  on all levels .
Ms Silva herself has blamed  old politics  for her defeat.
How has Dilma Rousseff s presidency measured up?
Statistics are in Ms Rousseff s favour.
During her tenure, unemployment has been lower than under any of her predecessors, at about 5%.
The minimum monthly wage  R$724; $304; £183  has increased despite the financial crisis and the number of undernourished Brazilians has fallen by more than 80% in the past decade, according to the UN.
To improve access to healthcare, 14,000 doctors have been drafted in from Cuba.
Other social programmes have further improved the life of lower-income households, a fact that even rival candidates have acknowledged.
What s holding Ms Rousseff back?
The past 18 months have been marred by recession and corruption scandals .
Dissatisfaction has manifested itself in the form of protests over poor public services and the World Cup costs .
Without the charisma possessed by her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Ms Rousseff has failed to garner the same public support.
What does Mr Neves bring to the table?
Mr Neves, 54, is a member of Brazil s white political elite, whose grandfather Tancredo Neves successfully ran for the presidency in 1985 but died before taking office.
Currently a senator, Mr Neves served as the governor of Brazil s second most populous state, Minas Gerais, from 2003 to 2010.
He is seen as the candidate who is favoured by big business in Brazil and has in the past condemned President Rousseff s handling of the economy, accusing the Workers  Party of frightening off investors.
What is Marina Silva s role in the second round?
Marina Silva is still expected to play a key role in the coming weeks as who she endorses could prove decisive in the second round.
Following her defeat on Sunday, Ms Silva seemed to indicate she would consider backing Mr Neves, saying  there is no way to misinterpret the sentiment of voters, of the 60% who moved for change .
During the campaign, Ms Silva s position on economic issues mirrored that of Mr Neves in many ways.
Critics said her business-friendly policies were an attempt to woo voters from Mr Neves, but analysts argue their agreement on policies such as the need to reform the country s complicated tax system and reduce the costs faced by small businesses make it more likely that Ms Silva will endorse Mr Neves in the second round.
SAO PAULO RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 6  Reuters  - An unexpectedly competitive runoff campaign for Brazil s presidency kicked off on Monday with leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff and her pro-business rival Aecio Neves racing to win over supporters of an ousted third-place candidate and other voters frustrated with a stagnant economy.
6 percent support in Sunday s first round of voting.
6 percent support, in the Oct.
26 runoff that will decide what has been Brazil s most unpredictable election in decades.
Rousseff remains a slight favorite due to her enduring support among the poor, but Neves is within striking distance.
Brazil s main stock index soared as much as 8 percent early on Monday, and the real currency gained as much as 3 percent as investors were cheered by the strong showing from the candidate they preferred all along.
Latin America s largest economy has been stuck in a rut for nearly four years under Rousseff, and most of Brazil s business community and Wall Street investors have made no secret of their desire for change.
Both remaining candidates immediately shifted their focus to the 21 percent of voters who backed the third-place finisher, environmentalist Marina Silva.
Silva s campaign fell apart late in the race amid questions about her shifting views on major issues, but she remains admired by many voters and she could still help swing the election with an endorsement.
Top Rousseff aide Gilberto Carvalho told reporters on Sunday night that he had already spoken to the head of Silva s Brazilian Socialist Party, Roberto Amaral, to ask for their support.
Carvalho said.
Most observers believe Rousseff has very little chance of winning formal backing from Silva, after unleashing a barrage of negative ads that contributed to her collapse.
Instead, her best hope may be for Silva to stay neutral, as she did after finishing third in the 2010 race, which could allow Rousseff to peel away her more left-leaning supporters.
Senior officials from Neves  Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  are hoping for a formal endorsement and they expected to meet with leaders of Silva s campaign on Monday, a party source told Reuters.
The two camps shared broadly similar market-friendly platforms and Silva s campaign chief, Walter Feldman, is a former PSDB leader with enduring ties to the party.
Another Silva aide who wields huge influence with her, Eduardo Giannetti, told reporters on Sunday night he would support Neves.
I don t think it would be good for Brazil to have four more years of  Rousseff ,  Giannetti said, according to the website for Veja magazine.  Now we have to re-establish confidence.
The runoff will be a battle between opposing visions for Brazil: the state-led capitalism of the ruling Workers  Party, and the market-friendly policies promised by Neves and the PSDB.
The two arch-rival parties have run Brazil for the last 20 years, and the campaign is already breaking down along class lines as Rousseff accuses the PSDB of favoring the rich.
More than half of Brazil s voters live in households earning less than $1,000 a month.
Polls taken prior to Sunday showed Rousseff would beat Neves by as much as 8 percentage points in a runoff.
Yet Neves  dramatic turnaround gives him clear momentum - important in a race in which most voters have told pollsters they want change from the government but also have misgivings about kicking Rousseff out of power.
As recently as 10 days ago, Neves was stuck in third place and trailed Silva by 9 percentage points.
But when Silva s lack of party support and reputation for unpredictable decisions scared away voters at the last minute, Neves  consistent pro-business message and calm, presidential air won them over.
The expectation of a Rousseff victory had in recent days battered Brazilian stocks and driven the currency to a five-year low.
Markets snapped back on Monday on hopes of a Neves victory.
Still, countless investors have already lost money in recent months betting on a Rousseff loss, only to see her bounce back thanks to support from blue-collar Brazilians.
Despite falling investment, weak consumer confidence and a loss of competitiveness by Brazilian manufacturers, Rousseff and her supporters blame the economic woes on international instability, not her policies.
Unemployment has remained near historic lows, and wages have been steady.
To win, Neves will have to distance himself somewhat from the PSDB s last time in government, from 1995 to 2002, a period that saw important pro-market reforms but is remembered by most voters for high unemployment and painful budget cuts.
He must also convince voters that his promise to jumpstart the economy won t come at the expense of social programs, especially a popular monthly stipend that low-income families receive in exchange for keeping their children in schools.
Rousseff said on Sunday that Brazilian voters  don t want a return to the past,  and called the PSDB the party of recession - even though Brazil s economy contracted under her own watch earlier this year.

The left-wing leader said she wanted to be  a much better president than I have been until now .
She faced mass protests last year against corruption and poor services.
But Ms Rousseff, who has been in power since 2010, remains popular with poor Brazilians thanks to her government s welfare programmes.
The vote split Latin America s biggest country almost evenly in two, along lines of social class and geography.
Whereas Dilma Rousseff did well in the poorer northern states, her opponent from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  took many of the wealthier and more developed southern parts of Brazil.
The president said that during the campaign  the word repeated most often was change and the idea most often invoked was reform .
The president s appeal for unity and dialogue was an important recognition that, despite 12 years of tangible social benefits under Workers  Party  PT  rule, millions of Brazilians are less than satisfied.
The standards of public services across the country in health, education and basic sanitation are too low for a country that prides itself on having the seventh largest economy in the world.
This government deserves credit for helping to bring millions of people out of poverty but, as a result, public expectations here are now much higher.
By the time Dilma leaves office in 2018, the Workers  Party will have been in power for 16 years.
That may prove too much for some to bear but it is undeniable that life for most Brazilians has improved immeasurably during the PT s mandate thus far.
Brasilia.
She also thanked her supporters, especially her political mentor and predecessor in office, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Her Workers  Party  PT , which has been in power since 2002, will now govern for another four-year term starting on 1 January 2015, but with a considerably weaker mandate than before.
Poorer Brazilians voted in Dilma Rousseff for a second term because of her party s track record in lifting millions out of poverty.
But the business community is more worried about the future.
The election race was full of twists and turns - all closely followed by the financial markets.
On Monday, the benchmark Bovespa index plunged more than 5%; all of its gains this year have been wiped out.
Ms Rousseff needs to persuade the business community that she is serious about tackling Brazil s economic woes.
Key to this will be who she names as her new finance minister and what policies her government will adopt.
Will it be more of the same interventionist policies that businesses say stifle confidence and trade?
Or will she, as promised, focus on reforms, to win back investor and consumer confidence and get Brazil growing once again?
Her lead over the Brazilian Social Democracy Party dropped from 12 percentage points in 2010 to three in Sunday s election.
The divided nature of the vote was palpable in Sao Paulo, where disappointed supporters of Mr Neves chanted  Kick the PT out!  while PT voters waved flags and celebrated in the streets.
Mr Neves admitted defeat and thanked the  more than 50 million Brazilians who voted for the path to change .
He said that the  overriding priority is to unite Brazil around an honourable programme worthy of all Brazilians .
Ms Rousseff promised wide-spread reform and a  rigorous fight against corruption , one of the grievances which led to mass protests last year.
She said she would  strengthen control mechanism and propose changes to the legislation to put an end to impunity .
Both Ms Rousseff and Mr Neves had made economic growth central to their election campaigns and the president again referred to her plans in her victory speech.
She said she would  continue to fight inflation and make improvements in the field of fiscal responsibility .
With Brazil s once booming economy now stagnant and inflation on the rise, analysts say her main challenges will be to regain the confidence of investors as well as that of those Brazilians who voted for Mr Neves.

Whether the rally fizzles out or gains momentum may depend most on what the third-place finisher does next.
Aecio Neves’s come-from-behind surge into second place in the Oct.
5 vote propelled him to the second round and spurred bets that a new government will take over after incumbent Dilma Rousseff oversaw the slowest expansion for any president in two decades.
To overcome his eight-point deficit in the initial round of voting, he may need the endorsement of one-time rival Marina Silva and her Socialist Party.
Silva has decided to support him, newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo reported, and she said allied parties will meet Oct.
9 to form a common position, according to statement published on her campaign website today.
Most investors had almost forgotten Aecio Neves was part of the race,” Eric Conrads, who helps oversee about $500 million in Latin American stocks at ING Groep NV, said by phone from New York .
Now the question mark is what percentage of Marina votes he’ll get.
It’s all about that.
7 percent yesterday as the country’s bonds and currencies rallied are betting on a change after Rousseff’s first term was marked by a surge in inflation and the country’s first recession in more than five years.
Neves, the former governor of Minas Gerais state, has said he would name his top economic adviser, former central bank President Arminio Fraga, as his finance minister as part of efforts to regain investor confidence in Brazil.

To win the final round of voting on Oct.
26, Neves will need to woo voters who had cast ballots for Silva, a 56-year-old former environment minister and evangelical Christian who polls had shown was likely to place second and join Rousseff in the runoff.
Neves’s press office declined to comment on the impact his candidacy has on the markets.
Silva’s campaign didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
I don’t think investors are capable of doing everything, and they certainly don’t win elections,” Rousseff said in response to a question about the market reaction to first-round results.
The benchmark index for Brazilian stocks posted the biggest rally since 2012 yesterday, led by an 11 percent jump for state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
The real climbed the most among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The strong showing for Neves helped reverse September’s slump in Brazilian stocks and the currency, which had the worst month in at least two years on expectation of a Rousseff re-election.
Rousseff got 42 percent of votes over the weekend, while Neves took 34 percent and Silva nabbed 21 percent.
In order to win the election, 54-year-old Neves would need to secure about two-thirds of the votes Silva got in the first round, according to Bruno Rovai, an emerging-market analyst at Barclays Plc.
Should Silva decide to announce her support for Neves, that could help Brazilian markets extend yesterday’s rally, he said in a telephone interview.
There’s still room for further gains if Marina makes her support for Aecio official,” Rovai said from New York.
Of those who intended to vote for Silva in the first round, 59 percent would vote for Neves in a runoff between him and Rousseff, while the incumbent would draw 24 percent of Silva’s support in the second round, according to the latest Datafolha poll before the first-round vote.
Neves needs to convince voters discontented with the current government that he can govern better than Rousseff in order to gain their support, according to Rafael Cortez, a political analyst at consulting firm Tendencias.
Dilma lost significant political capital and, as such, there’s a scenario of greater competitiveness,” Cortez said by phone from Sao Paulo .
Neves’s Brazilian Social Democracy party has broader support than Silva’s allies and is more capable of carrying out the changes needed to strengthen the Brazilian economy, said Wagner Salaverry, a director at Quantitas Gestao de Recursos SA.
While Rousseff’s party will remain the largest in the lower house of Congress, it will lose 18 seats to have 70 votes, based on partial election results, the Chamber of Deputies news agency reported yesterday.
Neves’s party would gain 10 seats to have 54, and Silva’s supporters would total 34 from 24 previously, the agency said.

The Ibovespa had fallen 12 percent from this year’s high on Sept.
2 through last week as polls showed increased support for Rousseff’s re-election bid.
Since taking office in January 2011, her administration has stepped up the government’s role in companies, changing concession rules to lower electricity rates and capping gasoline prices to tame inflation.
Under Rousseff’s watch, Brazil slipped into its first recession in more than five years in the second quarter, even after she cut taxes on consumer goods and increased government spending.

Investors need to be careful chasing whatever the latest polls are before making decisions,” Gibley said by phone from Denver.
Even though economic fundamentals are weak, investors may be encouraged to buy if Neves wins the presidential vote because of confidence that his team would be more successful in turning things around eventually, said Joao Medeiros, a director at Pioneer brokerage.
Rousseff has yet to announce who would make up her advisers in a second term.
Neves is positive for the market in the sense that there is clarity about his economic team,” Medeiros said by phone from Sao Paulo.
And what about Dilma?

On Sunday, Brazil will hold a run-off election to decide between its final two presidential candidates, Dilma Rousseff and Aécio Neves.
What follows is a very, very brief guide to Brazil 2014 basics: who s running, the parties, and why it matters.
Incumbent Dilma Rousseff  L  and challenger Aécio Neves  R .
Dilma Rousseff is the incumbent president.
Rousseff is facing a very tight challenge from Senator Aécio Neves of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party  PSDB .
Despite the name, the PSDB is on Brazil s center-right, and held power before the WP s victory in the 2002 election.
An earlier round of voting, on October 5,  eliminated a third major candidate, Marina Silva.
Silva threw her support to Neves, and since then Rousseff and Neves had been neck-and-neck.
But in late October, a spate of polls  showed Rousseff pulling ahead.
So Rousseff looks more likely to win, but it s a close race.

As in most democratic countries, the economy is at the center of the election.
Issues like inflation, poverty, and overall economic growth dominate the debate.
It s a left-right election, so Rousseff favors expanding government programs to address these problems, while Neves prefers a slate of market-friendly reforms.
Rousseff polls better among Brazil s poorer residents, while Neves leads among the society s wealthier.
Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue , thinks the candidates are  nearly converging  on major issues.
Foreign Policy .
Neves favors a more aggressive inflation target and a free-floating currency .
Corruption is also very important.
The PT has been linked to two major corruption scandals since 2003 and the Rousseff government in particular has faced accusations of increased bribery at the state-owned Petrobras oil company.

REUTERS Pilar OlivaresA worker walks past a banner of Brazil s President Dilma Rousseff.
Hoping for a win from pro-business candidate Aecio Neves, markets are expressing their disappointment.
Brazil s Ibovespa, the main index of stocks, fell by more than 6% as Brazilian markets opened.
That s just adding to the pain around the world.
77%.
It s the same story across the world.
The main ETF tracking Brazil in Japan opened down more than 7%.
Over the last four years, the Ibovespa has fallen close to a third, and it is down slightly this year-to-date.
Rousseff took power, and markets — correctly, in our view — see few signs of hope for a turnaround.
Rousseff will begin the significant shift to a more market-oriented economy that the country needs.
The economy will continue in its slow growth, high inflation, mode for the foreseeable future.
We therefore expect markets to remain under pressure.

Aécio” — a poster for presidential candidate Aécio Neves in Lapa, central Rio de Janeiro, with posters for allies Luiz Paulo and Otavio Leite.
The runoff in the presidential election in Brazil will take place this weekend between the incumbent President Dilma Roussef  PT  and challenger Aécio Neves  PSDB .
According to the conventional wisdom, the runoff is supposedly too close to call.
Even the endorsement of Neves by the third-place candidate on the general election, Marina Silva  PSB , did not change that.
But in an all-too-familiar scenario, the accuracy of the polls has been questioned .
Even the British weekly the Economist was quick to point to the difficulty of predicting the outcome of the general election in Brazil.
In their view, the few  roughly 40  surveys published during the three months of the presidential campaign and the limited number of elections  six in total  since the return of democracy in 1989, make forecasting of Brazilian elections particularly hard.
Final polls on the eve of the vote gave a slight edge to incumbent Dilma Rousseff, who is in a tight race against Aecio Neves, a 54-year-old former state governor.
In our view, with only four polling firms publishing their survey estimates during the campaign, we should not so much be concerned with ease of forecast but with the extent of potential biases in public poll estimates.
Having fewer pollsters might raise the stakes for presenting skewed numbers, but it also provides fewer opportunities for each pollster to “check” their numbers against their peers’.
But on the positive side, a healthy competition among pollsters might just be the necessary ingredient to foster good polling.
All of this becomes particularly relevant in the context of the “polling crises” that have been reported recently in various countries, including in other recent Latin American presidential elections such as Mexico in 2012, Honduras in 2013, or El Salvador, Costa Rica and Colombia in 2014.
This, then, begs the question: How did Brazilian pollsters perform in the first stage of the election?
To answer that question, we deployed a statistical model that allows us to estimate the true vote intention throughout the general election, and use this information to calculate the systematic bias of each pollster.
S.
In our case, we used all polls published in Brazil starting in early February of this year and ending with the last published surveys before the election.
Brazilian electoral legislation requires pollsters to publish vote estimates for all candidates, as well as null and don’t-know votes.
It also compels pollsters to publish a brief methodological summary and file it with the electoral authority.
Having this information readily available allowed us to separate signal from noise and track true vote intention for each candidate throughout the campaign and its associated 95 percent credible interval.
Our task is facilitated by the fact that we know the actual result of the general election.
Looking at these estimates, it would be hard to make the case that either the World Cup  June 12–July 13  or even the strident defeat of the Brazilian national team before Germany  July 8  had any noticeable effect on vote intent for Roussef.
But we can say that the tragic death of PSB candidate Eduardo Campos and the entry of Marina Silva to substitute for him was a game changer in the election for a brief period.
Figure: Francisco Cantú and Marco A.
Morales The Monkey Cage; Data: Datafolha, Ibope, Vox Populi and MDA.
Since we have a very good idea of how vote intent for each candidate moved throughout the campaign, we can also compute the systematic error with which each pollster estimated each candidate throughout the campaign.
Results appear in the graph below, which shows the distributions of systematic error throughout the campaign that is independent from sampling error.
Distributions appearing on the positive  right  side of the graph imply that a pollster tended to overestimate a candidate throughout the campaign, and distributions on the negative  left  side imply underestimation.
Figure: Francisco Cantú and Marco A.
Morales The Monkey Cage; Data: Datafolha, Ibope, Vox Populi and MDA.
Now we can answer the initial question: How did Brazilian pollsters do in the general election campaign?
In general terms, we see a mixed bag.
Vote intent for Dilma Roussef seems to have been systematically overestimated, although some firms performed better than others.
Curiously enough, despite the candidate change for the PSB, most pollsters seem to have estimated both Eduardo Campos and Marina Silva rather accurately, although with a very similar direction and magnitude of error.
Perhaps most interesting is that most polling firms seem to have consistently underestimated Aécio Neves, who ended in second place on the general election.
Now that we know that no candidate got the necessary majority to win the election outright, we will have two very different moments that will be interesting to contrast: the general election, which was strictly multipartisan, and the runoff, which will be strictly bipartisan.
It shall be interesting to see how pollsters performed when this next round is over.

RIO DE JANEIRO — The bohemian neighborhood of Lapa is a familiar place for Marcus Galiña and his peers.
Lapa s streets were host to many of the antigovernment protests that swept the nation over the past year and a half.
And Mr.
Galiña, an artist and an avid protester, was often there, witnessing the familiar scenes in demonstrations calling for better public services and government accountability: protesters in gas masks, Molotov cocktails, stun bombs, and arrests.
But just days before Brazil ’s presidential runoff, the battleground for antigovernment protests in Lapa is a sea of red, the color of Brazil’s ruling Workers’ Party.
Galiña – like many others active in Brazil’s protests – is doing something that few could have imagined just a few months ago: enthusiastically supporting the reelection of incumbent Dilma Rousseff .
But support for Rousseff in Sunday s hyper-polarized runoff election could bring about renewed disenchantment, says Luiz Jorge Werneck Vianna, a sociologist at Rio de Janeiro’s Pontifical Catholic University.
How is it that Dilma will govern after the election?
Will she govern with that left?
She will not,” says Mr.
Vianna.
Part of the far left’s journey back to Rousseff has to do with the lack of a candidate that met this group’s political demands.
In the first round of voting in early October, Brazil’s far left vehemently rejected former environmental minister  and socialist party candidate Marina Silva, who took over the ticket after her running mate was killed in a plane crash.
They pointed to problematic alliances Ms.
Silva tried to make as she scrambled  for support, teaming up with Pentecostal church powerhouses and the financial sector.
Many left-leaning Brazilians instead voted for small, far-left parties that fetched less than 2 percent of the overall votes, and Ms.
Silva was knocked out of the race.
The runoff pits Rousseff against the center-right candidate Aécio Neves, whose party Galiña and his peers do not seem as interested in engaging social activists.
It’s a tight race, according to polls that put only a few percentage points between the two.
The class divide between Rousseff and Mr.
Neves is deeply pronounced: Neves polls higher among wealthy and college educated Brazilians, while Rousseff has a lead in Brazil’s poorest states, where large portions of the population participate in welfare programs like Bolsa Família , which gives cash directly to mothers in exchange for keeping their kids in school and up to date on medical visits.
Endorsements for Rousseff among influential figures in Brazil’s far left include a well-known founder of the citizen media collective, Ninja Media; an actor from a popular YouTube comedy troop that makes snarky political satires; and the Rio activist and independent media group Colectivo Vinhetando.
Despite the election being painted as a high-stakes battle between left and right, the  candidates’ platforms are , in many ways, rather similar.
Both Rousseff and Neves promote closer ties with Washington , includiing steps to reinvigorate stagnant economic growth, and a continuation of Bolsa Família .
Both promise to fight corruption , as allegations against each party abounds.
This includes heated bribery charges in state-owned oil company Petrobras that link back to the Workers’ Party.
Neves, on the other hand, is under investigation for allegedly using public funds when he was state governor to purchase land from a relative in order to build an airport.
In June 2013, when antigovernment protests rocked Brazil – spurred by anger over a rise in the price of bus fares – the movement  brought together Brazilians of diverse  and even clashing political stripes, united in their exasperation with the status quo.
During the largest protest on June 20, 2013, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians demonstrated in more than 300 cities.
Rousseff’s approval ratings tumbled in the aftermath.
One year later, as Brazil prepared to host the 2014 World Cup, protesters were notably more homogeneous, made up of far-left activists who often faced off with police.
The targets of their ire – public spending, corruption, and poor public services like education and healthcare – implicated Rousseff.
But it was her predecessor and mentor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who fought to host the cup, an event Rousseff’s administration continued to champion and spend lavishly on.
Complaints about police violence led protests to expand to include the Rio state government, which is allied with Rousseff.
However, she earns credibility with the far left for her party s history of anti-poverty programs and progressive policies like college scholarships for low-income students and affirmative action programs at prestigious public universities.
A popular retro-colored meme depicts young Rousseff wearing thick glasses and a slight frown as she is photographed for her mug shot.
But not all Brazilians active in antigovernment protests are lending their support to Rousseff.
Unlike many of her peers, Carol Bertoni, a receptionist in a commercial building and a routine participant in protests, decided she simply won’t cast a ballot on Sunday.

Brazil s ongoing presidential election has been described as electrifying and unpredictable, suitable for a telenovela.
To be sure, there has been no shortage of high drama: the tragic, accidental death of a major candidate, the spectacular rise and fall of his vice presidential pick who took his place, and the late surge of a candidate who most pundits not long ago had written off.
Given the volatility, few dare predict with confidence what will happen in the Oct.
26 runoff between incumbent President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party  PT  and former Minas Gerais governor Aécio Neves of the Social Democratic Party  PSDB .
To add to the excitement, the second round has been cast by the two remaining candidates and their respective supporters as an ideological battle that pits left  Rousseff  versus right  Neves .
According to the Neves camp, Rousseff would continue the state-interventionist, protectionist policies she pursued during her first term, which have led to inflation and an economic slowdown, while Neves would embrace more market-friendly approaches and would open Brazil to the world, including the United States.
Rousseff, in turn, accuses Neves of proposing an economic program that serves the bankers and industrialists, while planning to cut back popular welfare programs that have made Brazil more equal and middle-class.
Rousseff and Neves spent most of their three face-to-face debates trading charges of corruption and nepotism  though the third had a less bitter tone .
Despite the bitterness of the campaign, however, the platforms of the two candidates are remarkably similar.
Both want growth and stability, poverty reduction, better public services, and more infrastructure.
Both have called for improved relations with Washington.
The negative campaigning on both sides appears to have had a considerable impact on Brazilian voters.
Headlines in every newspaper this month blared Rousseff s accusation that Neves and his party s exploitation of the latest corruption scandal was designed to foment a coup against her government.
Neves had said that Rousseff s party was guilty of  handing the country s largest company over to a gang of thieves.  In the first debate, Rousseff went on the attack, charging Neves with using public money for personal gain when he was appointed director of the Federal Savings Bank by his cousin in the 1980s.
Rousseff claims that when Neves was governor of Minas Gerais, public health deteriorated in the state, while Neves says that Rousseff s government has lost the capacity to attract investment.
The poor and the vulnerable middle class are concerned that a Neves victory could put at risk their real social gains, while the nation s well-off are worried that Rousseff is running the economy into the ground.
Poor Brazilians -- most receive cash payments and are concentrated in the north of Brazil -- overwhelmingly favor Rousseff, while those from the upper strata, particularly in the southern region around São Paulo, Brazil s major city, are keen on Neves.
Both Rousseff and Neves are disputing voters in the middle, who are less set in their positions and more susceptible to campaign appeals.
For a time, Marina Silva, the former environment minister who, after a stunning ascent, failed to make it to the final vote because of negative ads against her and her mistakes, had occupied the middle ground.
Silva and her adopted Socialist Party have backed Neves in the second round, though it is not clear whether that will be enough to deny Rousseff re-election.
The election may be mercurial, but that doesn t mean Brazilians have been indecisive.
Voters have displayed an altogether reasonable desire to have it all: continued social programs that are widely associated with the last 11 years of PT rule, coupled with an end to politics as usual and its attendant corrupt practices that do not befit a modern democratic society.
Not surprisingly, in the final days before the Oct.
26 vote, both Rousseff and Neves, who were never as far apart as they were commonly portrayed, have notably moved toward more centrist positions, nearly converging on their promise to strengthen programs for the poor, curtail corruption, protect the environment, and spur economic growth.
5 percent and strengthen the Bolsa Familia, a program that transfers small -- but significant for the recipients -- cash bonuses to poor families.
In fact, it seems that the one of the few areas where there s fundamental  disagreement between the two candidates is over monetary policy.
While such pledges can be readily dismissed as empty campaign posturing to secure ballots, it is likely that the policies the candidates would eventually adopt as president overlap in significant respects.
The election puts into sharp relief two competing narratives that have recently dominated Brazil coverage in both Brazilian and international media.
The first highlights the impressive expansion of a middle class -- some 40 million over the past 11 years, according to Brazilian government statistics -- and the corresponding reduction in poverty and inequality.
Thanks to a relatively benign economic environment with substantial investment in emerging markets  until recently  and external, chiefly Chinese, demand for the country s commodities, together with vigorous social programs like the Bolsa Familia, previously poor Brazilians have enjoyed more access to consumer goods and jobs.
Per capita income and employment levels have risen.
Politically, most of the credit for such social strides goes to Luiz Inácio  Lula  da Silva, the two-term PT president who left office in 2011 with 80 percent approval and remains enormously popular and a major  thought not fully tapped  asset for Rousseff in the final round.
To counter the charge of being indifferent to the poor, Neves points to the fact that former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the PSDB not only managed to stabilize the economy during his two terms in office  1995 to 2003  but also succeeded in getting cash-transfer programs off the ground.
The second narrative is the country s rampant corruption, which is one of Rousseff s chief vulnerabilities.
To be sure, corruption has been endemic in Brazil, but two major scandals during the PT government inflicted more political damage on the party that has been in power since 2003.
Since Rousseff served as energy minister under Lula, the recent and mounting charges of bribery and kickbacks at Petrobras, Brazil s state-owned company, could particularly hurt her.
As energy minister she was formally board chairwoman while the corruption took place.
The country s long-ossified bureaucracies, now filled with PT political appointees after 11 years of PT rule, are a convenient target for Neves, who is positioning himself as being aligned with the kind of reforms Brazilians overwhelmingly favor.
Rousseff, of course, is doing precisely the same, insisting that she too is committed to clean and honest government.
Since taking office she has dismissed eight ministers charged with corruption.
Still, if the corruption question becomes more salient in the final days of the campaign, that will not be good news for Rousseff.
Corruption often has a greater political impact when the economy is not performing well.
In the case of Brazil, though unemployment remains low, inflation and interest rates are climbing, and the economy is stagnant -- the result not only of a more problematic external environment but also of some questionable policy decisions.
Neves and Rousseff both promise to jump-start the economy.
Neves supporters are convinced that Rousseff is incorrigibly tied to a closed economy, while Rousseff backers believe that under Neves economic growth will only benefit the top stratum.
In practice, however, the two candidates are not so dramatically far apart when it comes to economic policy.
If re-elected, for example, Rousseff has said she will massively change her cabinet.
She knows that continuing with current policies will doom her second term.
And Neves would have to contend with parts of his constituency who are anti-Rousseff but are not exactly champions of an unfettered market.
In addition, in foreign policy there will probably be greater coincidence between a Rousseff and Neves presidency than is commonly thought.
There has been a tendency to overstate the differences, particularly by Neves supporters in Brazil and abroad, who are eager for a greater opening of the economy and a more robust trade policy, along with friendlier relations between Brasilia and Washington.
The bilateral relationship has been strained, most recently because of revelations that the National Security Agency had been spying on the Brazilian president and the state-owned company Petrobras.
The controversy led to last year s cancellation of a planned state visit to Washington and a frosty relationship since.
There is little question that much of Washington, frustrated with Rousseff, would likely be more enthusiastic and energetic in pursuing new initiatives with Brazil under a Neves government.
Brazil relations is unlikely: There are too many disagreements on bilateral, regional, and global issues.
Persistent trade disputes, contrasting views on how to respond to anti-democratic developments in Latin America, and sharp differences on approaches to dealing with the global economic crisis will make it difficult to turn the page.
For now, neither Washington nor Brasilia seems particularly prepared to make a significant and sustained investment in a better relationship.
It is useful to remember that the global stature Brazil has achieved in recent years -- inclusion as a BRIC member, along with Russia, India, and China, major roles in WTO negotiations and environmental conferences, a credible bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council -- is to some extent attributable to its independence and distance from the United States.
The prospect of a  strategic partnership  between the United States and Brazil is far-fetched, at least in the short term.
Few Brazilians these days, though, are thinking about foreign policy -- much less about relations with Washington.
They are, understandably, focused on domestic priorities and more urgent challenges such as securing better education, health, security, and justice for most citizens.
Progress on these scores has been disappointing.
Corruption, waste, and the poor quality of public services galvanized the massive protests that swept Brazilian cities last year.
Today, the streets are calm but the problems remain unaddressed.
After the drama of the presidential campaign, a new administration will turn to the tough task of governing a complex country, with multiple political and societal forces and pressures.
An election dominated by negative campaigning should not obscure the broad consensus among Brazilians about the path their country should pursue.
The goals are clear and widely shared.
The challenge is finding the leader and team best equipped to navigate Brazil s political and bureaucratic thicket.
There s nothing especially remarkable about Omarjan Azari or Abdul Numan Haider.
No high-level training, no exotic travel histories or vast overseas networks, not even any pattern of political agitation.
Just about everything in their lives looked manifestly, ordinarily suburban.
Then last month, Azari found himself at the center of the biggest counterterrorism raid in Australian history.
Deploying some 800 police officers and a helicopter, security forces  arrested 15 people across two states.
Within a week, in an entirely separate incident, Haider was  shot dead by police.
Perhaps fearing he would travel to the Middle East to fight, police had deemed him a person of interest and cancelled his passport.
When they arranged a meeting with him, he attacked the police with a knife.
Two officers were injured -- one critically, with stab wounds to his head, neck, and stomach.
The police found an IS flag in Haider s pocket.
Both men are now the emblems of a newly heightened Australian terrorism threat that has emerged in the wake of IS s notoriety.
Amid fears of repatriated fighters -- the government  claims  that dozens of Australians have traveled to join IS -- lawmakers in Canberra have  proposed  a suite of counterterrorism laws that, among other things, would legalize expanded surveillance, criminalize certain speech deemed incendiary, and ban individuals from traveling to certain  declared areas  where terrorist groups are warring.
Meanwhile, on Oct.
The alleged plot of a random, public execution has plenty of shock value, but perhaps the most crucial lesson here lies in the thorough ordinariness of these young men.
Azari and Haider never traveled to Syria.
They are not formal operatives of IS or the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.
However catastrophic their ultimate intentions, and however passionately they hold their radical politics, they do so as amateurs.
They are not embedded within a discrete, coherent terror organization -- one that can be eradicated through conventional security operations.
Rather, they are products of polarizing forces within Australian society itself.
Neither Azari nor Haider had proven ties with IS combatants.
The most that can be said is that Azari had some phone contact with a senior IS recruiter.
But even the nature of that contact is being  disputed  in court, since Azari s lawyers assert the charges are based on a single call, and that Azari was not taking orders from the person on the other end of the line.
For these Australian men, IS is not fundamentally an organization to be joined, but a symbol to be appropriated.
Fidelity to the group is not a product of authority or even recruitment in the traditional sense, so much as of inspiration and persuasion.
For the disaffected Muslim youth of Australia, IS exists in the mind, and especially online.
This appeal, though, is engendered by local grievances: anger at Australia s involvement in the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan; perceptions of discriminatory policing; a public culture hostile to Islam; and a sense that Muslims  concerns are sidelined in Australian politics.
Such grievances are mutually reinforcing and come together in a single overarching idea that the West  Australia included  is engaged in a  war on Islam.  Proponents of a radical brand of Islam trade on this argument to further alienate disaffected youth.
Thus, for some, these two identities -- Muslim and Australian -- are perceived as mutually exclusive.
A police raid -- while occasionally necessary -- does not make alienated young Muslims feel more Australian.
It is unlikely to reduce the inspirational appeal IS may hold for such an audience, and may even increase it if it is perceived to be in any way excessive, discriminatory, or arbitrary.
Here, then, is the great paradox of Australia s situation: What may be an action necessary to secure short-term security risks inflaming further radicalization.
Within hours of the Azari raid, photographs of badly bruised young Muslim men, allegedly injured by intruding police, circulated wildly on social media.
By day s end, the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir  organized  a 400-strong protest in Sydney, where demonstrators held placards demanding that police  Stop Terrorizing Muslims.  Some in the community have  focused  the debate around the timing of the raids, arguing they were excessive and politicized, and used to justify the deployment of Australian troops in Iraq.
These events have set off a different sort of radicalization, one that emerges from broader society, and even the country s political class.
Three days after the raids, Jacqui Lambie, a minor party politician,  equated  sharia law with terrorism and said it should be outlawed.
She subsequently introduced  a bill into Parliament to ban face-veiling in all public spaces, with the support of some government MPs.
Soon after, on Oct.
2, parliamentary speakers  issued  a bizarre procedural rule that, for security reasons, all people wearing face coverings must observe the proceedings of Parliament from within a separate glass enclosure.
A number of politicians  denounced  the decision and Prime Minister Tony Abbott quickly  asked  his Senate and House leaders to reconsider.
Meanwhile, Australia has witnessed an unprecedented spate of anti-Muslim violence.
On Sept.
29, an unknown assailant  attacked  a Muslim woman and threw her from a moving train.
Earlier that week, vandals  defaced  a Brisbane mosque with hateful graffiti, and a group of youths threatened  a young man, whom they wrongly assumed to be Muslim, with beheading.
This is but a fraction of the incidents that have occurred.
The police have described the spate of attacks against Muslims as  relentless,  leaving some in the community too  scared  to even venture outside.
What are young Muslims, grappling with the question of whether or not Australian society has a place for them, to make of this?
About the worst message that can be sent to Australia s Muslims is that they must make a choice -- that Islam and Australia are irreconcilable.
And yet that is precisely the message coming from both Muslim and non-Muslim extremes.
On some level the government understands this, which is why its senior members  warn  against demonizing Islam and Muslims.
But this only reveals the government s inability to control such things -- even within its own ranks, let alone across society.
This is a snapshot of a society becoming polarized.
Australia is a nation in the grip of something cyclical: a mutually reinforcing -- and radicalizing -- dynamic of suspicion and counter-suspicion.
The question for now is whether this is merely a reflexive episode triggered by the trauma of such a dramatic raid, and the gut-wrenching plot it allegedly uncovered, or rather a reflection of underlying social currents that have merely now been exposed.
Because what s the use in ensuring not a single, hardened, professional terrorist returns from Syria, if young, disenfranchised Australian Muslims are running towards them?

Rio de Janeiro  AFP  - After a dramatic, virulent campaign, Brazilians voted for their next president Sunday, weighing leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff s legacy of social progress against challenger Aecio Neves s promise of economic revival.
Rousseff, Brazil s first woman president, was the narrow favorite heading into the vote, with a four- to six-point advantage in the final opinion polls -- though the race to lead the world s seventh-largest economy remained too close to call.
The election is widely seen as a referendum on 12 years of government by the Workers  Party  PT  -- eight under working-class hero Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and four under Rousseff.
9 percent.
5 percent.
Rousseff, 66, has presided over rising inflation and a recession this year.
She also faced massive protests last year against corruption, record spending on the World Cup and poor public education, health care and transport.
Neves, the business-world favorite, has vowed to reboot the economy with market-friendly policies while safeguarding the PT s social programs, fending off Rousseff s attempts to cast him as a fat cat who will govern for the upper class.
Rousseff said after casting her vote in the southern city of Porto Alegre, sipping on a cup of local mate tea.
Neves, accompanied by his ex-model wife, gave V for victory signs as he cast his ballot in Belo Horizonte, where he served two terms as governor of Minas Gerais state.
54-year-old senator tweeted optimistically.
Rouseff has been hit hard by corruption scandals, especially a multi-billion-dollar embezzlement scheme implicating dozens of politicians -- mainly her allies -- at state-owned oil giant Petrobras.
As the campaign wrapped up, conservative news magazine Veja dragged the scandal back to the fore, quoting a suspect in the case as saying Rousseff and Lula personally knew of the scam -- a claim the president vehemently denied.
I am voting for Neves.
Roberto Carlos da Silva, a 34-year-old doctor in a chic Sao Paulo suburb, told AFP.
I m voting for the PT because I believe in its project of social change.
People hate the PT because things have changed.
Maria de Fatima de Oliveira Borges in Brasilia.
Winning back front-runner status has been a fierce battle for Rousseff, a former guerrilla who was once jailed and tortured for fighting the country s 1964-1985 military regime.
First she had to fend off environmentalist Marina Silva, who surged in the opinion polls with her vow to become Brazil s first  poor, black  president when she dramatically entered the race after running mate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash.
Silva ultimately exited the first round three weeks ago, with 21 percent of the vote to 42 percent for Rousseff and 34 percent for Neves.
She endorsed Neves, whose comeback briefly lifted him into first place and prompted Rousseff to go on the attack.
In an acrimonious campaign, Rousseff accused Neves of nepotism as Minas Gerais governor and played up a report that he once hit his then-girlfriend in public.
Neves, the grandson of the man elected Brazil s first post-dictatorship president, responded in kind, accusing Rousseff of lying, incompetent economic management and  collusion  in the Petrobras kickbacks.
8 million voters are deeply divided along social lines.
The key battleground is in the industrialized southeast, the cradle of the million-strong protests last year.
There, a growing middle class remains grateful for its gains under the PT but is making ever-louder demands.
Voters are also electing governors in run-offs in 14 states.
Results are expected shortly after polls close at 2200 GMT, thanks to a sophisticated electronic voting system.
Brazil has deployed soldiers to beef up security in 224 cities across the country.
A polling station in the northeastern city of Mossoro was shocked when a man standing in line to vote was shot to death in what police described as an apparent settling of scores.
Nationwide 147 people were arrested for election-related  irregularities  -- mostly illegal campaigning, election officials said.

RIO DE JANEIRO  AP  — It s the presidential election that just keeps surprising.
A year after a spasm of huge anti-government protests across Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff piled up more votes in Sunday s election than any challenger, but it wasn t enough to avoid a runoff in three weeks.
The race kept up its unpredictable nature as Aecio Neves, a center-right former governor and senator with deep political lineage, came in second.
He had languished in the polls during the campaign but surged in the past week to overtake former environment minister Marina Silva, who at one time was the front-runner.
In late August, Silva held a double-digit lead over the field after only entering the race following the death of her Socialist Party s initial candidate in a plane crash.
But then her reputation and credentials were picked apart by aggressive campaigning from Rousseff s long-governing Workers  Party.
6%.
Silva got 21%.
The Oct.
26 runoff will now pit the candidates of Brazil s two most powerful parties, which together have produced all of Brazil s presidents the past 20 years and are well known to Brazilians.
Neves is backed by the well-organized Social Democracy Party, which held the presidency from 1994 until 2002, a period when Brazil tamed hyperinflation and turned the economy around.
Aecio s performance has been extraordinary, and one of the reasons for this is the very strong party structure behind him — a party with a strong nationwide presence and which has been in the presidency,  said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil s leading think tank.  It is now a new election where everything is wide open.
Neves is an economist and former two-term governor of Minas Gerais, Brazil s second-most populous state, where he left office in 2010 with an approval rating above 90%.
He has strong name recognition in Brazil as the grandson of Tancredo Neves, a widely beloved figure who was chosen to become Brazil s first post-dictatorship president but fell ill and died before taking office.
Neves emphasized those roots in a statement Sunday night.
What I can say, what comes to mind, is what my grandfather Tancredo said 30 years ago when he won the elections for president of the republic:  We must not get dispersed.
54-year-old politician, who also has served four terms as a congressman and one as a senator.
Rousseff s aggressive campaigning proved the downfall for Silva, who had been thought poised to tap into the widespread disdain Brazilians hold for the political class — anger that boiled over into last year s roiling protests.
But Silva couldn t withstand the president s barrage of attacks labeling her as indecisive and without the mettle needed to lead the globe s fifth-largest nation.
Marina Silva tried but was not able to convey her message of change.
Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.
During nearly 12 years in power, the Workers  Party has ushered in strong social programs that have helped lift millions out of poverty and into the middle class.
Rousseff s strongest support comes from the poorest, those who are precariously hanging onto gains amid an economy that has sputtered the past four years.
In contrast to Neves  call for more centrist economic approaches, Rousseff promised in her campaign to expand social programs and continue strong state involvement in the economy, a stand that has drawn criticism from the business sector.
Rousseff told a crowd of supporters late Sunday.
Associated Press writers Brad Brooks and Jenny Barchfield reported this story in Rio de Janeiro and AP writer Stan Lehman reported from Sao Paulo.
Challenger Marina Silva  left  and incumbent Dilma Rousseff face off during a presidential debate in Aparecida, Brazil, in September.
Brazilians head to the polls Sunday in one of the most exciting elections in recent history there.
The presidential race pits two women against each other — a first for the South American country.
Candidate Marina Silva, if elected, would make history by being the first Afro-Brazilian president.
But first she must beat incumbent Dilma Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured under the dictatorship in Brazil.
It s been an election season filled with shocks.
The presidential candidate Eduardo Campos was killed in a plane crash in mid-August, thrusting Silva, his vice presidential running mate, into the top spot on the socialist ticket.
And suddenly what looked like an easy re-election for Rousseff got very competitive and very negative.
Rousseff is fighting for her political life and hasn t pulled any punches.
One campaign ad shows a greedy cabal of businessmen literally taking food off a working class family s plate.
It alleges Silva s plan to make Brazil s central bank independent will hand over its power to big business.
Silva responded with an impassioned spot of her own , talking about growing up hungry and poor in the Amazon and saying she wasn t going to stoop to Rousseff s scare tactics.
There is a third candidate, Aecio Neves.
He s from the right and is in third place, but has recently been moving up in the polls.
None of the candidates seem to have the required 50 percent to win outright, and so the election will — it seems — go to a second round.
Everyone is required by law to vote in Brazil and debates can get rather heated, as we discovered when we visited the humble, tin-roofed house of the dos Santos family.
Leila dos Santos says last time she voted for Rousseff, but this time she wants to vote for Silva.
Leila says.
Leila s 65-year-old mother Ana says she is going to vote for Rousseff and her governing Workers  Party.
She says she appreciates the social programs like Bolsa Familia, which gives cash to families in return for sending children to school.
Ana says.
Leila s younger sister Aurea is going to vote for the rightist candidate, Aecio Neves.
She thinks Rousseff s party, known as the PT, and all of its recent corruption scandals have shown they have been in power too long.
But under Rousseff s party Brazil boomed.
Her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, enacted policies that raised millions onto the lowest rung of the middle class.
People like the dos Santos family are more interested in services like health and education than poverty reduction.
Leila says she wants to be able to rely on the country s health system but she can t.
And that s why this election is too close to call.
The neighborhood of Jardim Angela in Sao Paulo s south was formed a dozen years ago when people from the poor northeast of the country invaded the land there and built makeshift homes.
Now, it s a proper neighborhood with a community center and paved roads, its history a reflection of the dramatic changes in Brazil in the last decade.
This neighborhood was staunchly in Rousseff s camp in 2010.
They helped elect her into office, but now people here have splintered.
David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the University of Brasilia.
Brazil s economy is stagnating, and the same party has ruled for 12 years.
People are tired and want change, Fleischer says.
But more recent polls show that Rousseff s negative campaign ads have been working.
Her popularity has been steadily climbing and her message that change can be as frightening as it is enticing is resonating.

RIO DE JANEIRO  AP  — Brazil s left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected Sunday in the tightest race the nation has seen since its return to democracy three decades ago, after a bitter campaign that divided Brazilians like no other before it.
5 percent.
Rousseff s victory extends the rule of the Workers  Party, which has held the presidency since 2003.
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps — those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
The Workers  Party s time in power has seen a profound transformation in Brazil.
But four straight years of weak economic growth under Rousseff, with an economy that s now in a technical recession, has some worried those gains are under threat.
Brazilians want it all.
Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue.
Rousseff and Neves have fought bitterly to convince voters that they can deliver on both growth and social advances.
This year s campaign is widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Neves has hammered at Rousseff over a widening kickback scandal at state-run oil company Petrobras, with an informant telling investigators that the Workers  Party directly benefited from the scheme.
Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.
Rousseff said before voting in southern Brazil.
In Rio de Janeiro, 43-year-old lifeguard Marcelo Barbosa dos Santos voted in the Botafogo neighborhood and said he s been a Rousseff backer from the beginning.

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and challengers Marina Silva and Aecio Neves have sparred over currency policy and social programs in the run-up to the presidential election Sunday.
But one pressing topic has largely been left out of the debates: foreign policy.
Foreign policy is not an issue for wide public debate,” said Peter Hakim of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank.
He indicated the average Brazilian voter is more concerned about the “kitchen table issues” such as access to consumer goods and the continuation of social programs that have lifted millions out of poverty.
However, business leaders have contended Brazil’s unwillingness to nurture its relationships with foreign partners has contributed to a stagnant economy that shrank for two consecutive quarters amid rising inflation and a weakening currency.
The country’s two major trade partners -- China and Argentina -- are grappling with their own economic woes.

Obama administration spied on Rousseff’s personal communications.

Brazil’s exports of crude oil and metals, as well as agricultural goods such as coffee and fruits.
If Rousseff retains her presidency, Brazil will likely continue its narrow foreign policy focused on strengthening relationships within South America.
The Buenos Aires  Argentina  Herald reported Trade Minister Mauro Borges said last weekend that the Rousseff government was not looking to leave Mercosur , the trade bloc it shares with Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela, a nod to Brazilian industrialists who benefit from the bloc.
Rousseff’s rivals, Silva and Neves, are currently neck and neck in polls to move into a runoff election with the incumbent.
Both would rethink Brazil’s role in Mercosur.
They have argued it stifles the Brazilian economy, which could appeal to voters hurting in an economy that has seen slow growth and high inflation since Rousseff took office.
Silva is also critical of Brazil’s relationship with Russia, India, China and South Africa through the BRICS economic partnership.
She would rather see Brazil work with the Pacific Alliance, which consists of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

After successfully hosting the 2014 World Cup, the South American   powerhouse looked poised to reelect President Dilma Rousseff.
But   the tragic accident that killed candidate Eduardo Campos put   popular former Environment Minister Marina Silva back in the   game.
No one knows what is next.
Rousseff is still the favorite, but chances of a difficult runoff   are bigger than ever.
Doubt lies on who sheâ€™d run against â€“ the   oppositionâ€™s Aecio Neves is tied with Silva in the polls, with   about 20 percent for each.
Campos was third in the polls with 8   percent until last week, when his jet crashed in Santos, near Sao   Paulo.
The poll that shows Silva in a competitive position was   taken during the peak of the commotion over his death and   suggests she has attracted basically undecided voters.
The decision of the Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB  to go for the   former minister came after a round of consultations with local   leaders and the poll shows her in a competitive position.
The first vote will be on October 5th.
As her replacement as a vice presidential candidate, Silva picked   Congressman Beto Albuquerque, who holds strong ties to   agribusiness.
Leaders of Brazilâ€™s most important source of   revenues are suspicious of the former minister who became a   global figure against deforestation.
Albuquerque will also be the   man who keeps the local deals made by Campos, since Silva was not   on board with many, including key ones to reelect governors in   big states.
Silvaâ€™s nomination made an impact in the two other campaigns.
Although Rousseff and Neves havenâ€™t aimed at the new challenger   yet, many members of their parties have already suggested that   Camposâ€™ replacement doesnâ€™t have the experience or the skills to   bring the change Brazilians want, according to polls.
Both have   also pushed harder to gather support from undecided voters.
Thursday was a cornerstone on Silvaâ€™s campaign: she had her first   appearance in PSB programs on free-to-air TV channels.
Those   started without her on August 19th on radio and TV and will go   till four days before the first vote.
Although the campaign trail   kicked off in June last year during the street protests, most   Brazilians will only pay attention to the candidates and the   elections once the propaganda is up and running on prime time TV.
Brazilâ€™s electoral law gives candidates and their parties a good   chunk of time for ads depending on the number of Congressmen each   coalition has.
Rousseff will be on for more than 11 minutes in   each of the two programs that will be on the popular free-to-air   channels every two days.
Neves received about 5 minutes.
Silva   got 1 minute 47 seconds, which is not so different from 2010,   when 20 million people voted for her.
Another Datafolha poll is likely to be published next week to   measure the impact of the free airtime on the candidates.
Until   then, experts and politicians admit the landscape is very far   from the obvious outcome before Camposâ€™ tragedy.

Sao Paulo, Brazil  CNN  -- Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff won a hotly contested runoff election on Sunday.
59% of the vote, according to official results.
41%.
Neves said he called to congratulate Rousseff, who thanked voters on Twitter late Sunday for their support.
The election was one of the tightest competitions in recent years.
Before becoming the country s first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers  Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva.
She claims that under the presidencies of her predecessor and herself, masses of Brazilians have risen out of poverty.
Rousseff, 66, presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil.
She took a lot of political flack over how public money was spent.
The President defeated Neves, a 54-year-old economist, who is a well-known name and a career politician.
The pro-business candidate belongs to the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, one of the country s strongest.

Former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso confirmed this week something that many of us have suspected: If the opposition wins the Oct.
5 presidential election, there will be changes in Brazilian foreign policy that might affect all of Latin America.
Cardoso, who modernized Latin America’s biggest economy during his two terms from 1995 to 2003 and remains one of Brazil’s most respected politicians, told me in an interview that if opposition candidate Marina Silva wins, she would not give her unconditional support to Venezuela, Argentina and other leftist populist governments, as current President Dilma Rousseff has done.
According to the latest polls, no candidate is likely to win in the first round of voting.
In a second round, scheduled for Oct.
26, Socialist Party candidate Silva would have 47 percent of the vote, while Rousseff, of the ruling Workers’ Party, would get 43 percent, according to an Ibope poll released Wednesday.
Cardoso supports another opposition candidate, Aécio Neves.
But the former president says that if Neves doesn’t make it to the second round, he would support Silva.
Yes, I think there would be changes” if Silva wins, Cardoso told me.
Under Rousseff, he said, “there is a paralysis in Brazil’s foreign policy” because she has been focused on trying to revitalize South America’s ailing Mercosur common market instead of trying to simultaneously sign free-trade agreements with the European Union, the United States and Japan.
Many government officials are, to put it in a simple word, ‘Bolivarian,’” Cardoso told me.
In their hearts, they are with  Chávez.
But not in their heads, because they know that Brazil’s interests don’t coincide with that ideology.
As a result, they don’t know what to do.
Cardoso added that the government’s prevailing view “is outdated, Third World-ish, from the ’60s or ’70s.
I don’t think that Marina Silva shares that outdated vision.
If Silva wins, Cardoso said, she would try to shift away from Brazil’s current, inward-looking, Mercosur-centered policies.
Under current Mercosur regulations, which Rousseff supports, no member of the group can unilaterally negotiate free-trade agreements with third parties.
In addition, Brazil would be more assertive in defending democracy in the region, Cardoso said.
Venezuela was made part of Mercosur without any effort by the Brazilian government to seek Venezuela’s compliance with the Mercosur democracy clause,” he said.
He said Argentina is constantly demanding more exceptions for itself from Mercosur‘s own free-trade rules, and that the Argentine government is dragging its feet in Mercosur free-trade talks with the 28-country European Union.
We aren’t signing a free-trade deal with Europe because our  allies, especially Argentina, don’t want it, for fear of having to lower their custom tariffs.
Much of this would change if the opposition wins in Brazil,” Cardoso said.
Asked why he is so confident that the opposition will win, considering that the some surveys are showing a statistical tie in the runoff election, Cardoso cited the fact that Rousseff’s Workers Party is leading in the polls in only three of Brazil’s 27 states, and that Rousseff has a much higher negative rating than Silva.
My opinion: The opposition’s advantage in some polls may shrink over the next three weeks because Rousseff will enjoy much more television air time than Silva.
The president’s negative campaign against Silva also is eroding some of the opposition candidate’s support.
Still, there is a 50 percent chance of an opposition victory, if not more.
3 percent economic growth rate this year.
As Cardoso says, an opposition win would mean fewer ideological attachments to “Third World-ish” governments, and a new focus on inserting Brazil into the global economy by signing trade deals with the biggest industrialized countries.
That could help Brazil return to a growth path, and — considering that the country makes up more than 60 percent of South America’s economy — could turn the whole region in a new economic and political direction.

Brazilian president and presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff, right, rallies in Gama, 45 km from Brasilia, Brazil on Sept.
27, 2014.
The Brazilian general elections will take place on Oct.
5.
8 million voters will cast ballots next Sunday to decide the next leader of the continent-sized nation, the world’s seventh-biggest economy.
Voters will also choose 27 state governors, 513 congressmen, 1,069 regional assembly lawmakers and a third of the senate.
Rousseff, handpicked by charismatic predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, had been expected to win a second mandate until former Workers Party  PT  colleague Marina Silva crashed the party.
Silva became Socialist Party candidate only after the August death in an air crash of Eduardo Campos, her former running mate.
Earlier polling had put Rousseff well clear of both Campos and Social Democratic Party candidate Aecio Neves.
That all changed with the arrival of Silva, 56, who served as Lula’s environment minister before switching to the Green Party, and whose 2010 presidential bid netted her 20 million votes, for third place.
This time around, Silva enjoyed a month of polls suggesting a narrow run-off vote victory before the Rousseff camp began a vigorous fight back, with the latest surveys giving Rousseff the lead ahead of a likely second round on October 26.
Yet despite her current upsurge, the scenario is less rosy for Rousseff than four years ago.
The 66-year-old daughter of a Bulgarian entrepreneur donned the presidential sash following eight largely euphoric years under Lula that saw an economic boom help fund a vast range of welfare programs that lifted tens of millions of Brazilians out of poverty.
They joined a burgeoning middle class who are now showing their frustration at rising costs of living as well as political corruption.

24, 2014.
After Rousseff took office in January 2011, dark clouds appeared over the economy as the global economic crisis helped put a brake on growth while inflationary pressures pushed living costs up.
The Rousseff administration’s economic credibility took another a hit last month with confirmation the country had entered a recession.
Rousseff’s government had already been enduring a bumpy ride after protests drew around a million people onto the streets in June 2013 to protest poor public services while Brazil was investing in the World Cup.
The protest movement accused the political elite of being inefficient, corrupt and unable to deliver health, education and transport systems worthy of the developed country Brazil aspires to be.
Voters now have the chance to pass judgment on the Rousseff years and, if they wish, to put their faith in Silva’s vision of a new start.
Rousseff vs.
In Rousseff, voters can stick with a former guerrilla who was jailed and tortured under the military dictatorship, a tough-talking economist and PT leftist who served as energy minister, then as Lula’s chief of staff.
Or they can twist with Silva, who rose from a humble background in a village in Amazonia, the daughter of rubber tappers who only learned to read at 16 and worked as a maid before rising to become Brazil’s youngest senator and then environment minister.
The religious convictions of a woman who could become Brazil’s first black leader wow some in a country where evangelicals are on the rise — but equally turn others off.
A Silva win would end two decades of domination by the PT and the Social Democrats, who held power under former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso from 1995-2003.
Without a strong party base, Silva is courting the large constituency of those disaffected by party politics, symbolized by last year’s demonstrations.
Investors also prefer her to Rousseff’s financial interventionism, which they blame for Brazil’s economic ills.
Silva says she hopes to govern “with the best” across the political spectrum in a break with partisan politics.
We are going to recover the economic stability of Fernando Henrique’s government, … lost under the current government.
And we are going to maintain and deepen social inclusion started under the Lula government — today threatened by Dilma’s with the return of inflation, high interest rates and feeble growth,” Silva said.
Rousseff retorts that Silva’s lack of a party machine could paralyze politics as she may struggle to find a majority in Congress.
In a democracy, nobody can govern without a party,” said Rousseff, noting Silva’s Socialist Party base is just 33 lawmakers.
While optional, these questions help us better understand The Tico Times readership.
Gracias.
Millions cast their ballot for next president, as polls show incumbent Dilma Rousseff defeating election rivals.
Millions of Brazilians are heading to the polls to choose the country s next president, in one of the most unpredictable election campaigns in decades.
More than 142 million Brazilians are voting in presidential and legislative elections on Sunday in a vote expected to force a three-week runoff between incumbent Dilma Rousseff and one of her two top challengers.
On the eve of the election, Rousseff held a commanding lead in all recent opinion polls, followed by Aecio Neves and Marina Silva, a former environment minister.
According to a survey by pollster Datafolha, Rousseff was leading with 44 percent voter support.
Neves, a pro-business Social Democrat senator, has 26 percent of voter support versus 24 percent for Silva.
Several other opinion polls showed Rousseff defeating either candidate by more than five percentage points in a likely runoff, which will take place on October 26 if no candidate wins a majority of valid votes in the first round.
Roussef told reporters early on Sunday it was unlikely she could push through to win the absolute majority required to avoid a second-round election.
The election, expected to be the closest in a generation, is widely seen as a referendum on 12 years of government by Rousseff s Workers  Party  PT .
The country is divided between voters loyal to the PT for an economic boom that lifted millions from poverty in the 2000s and those calling for an end to the corruption scandals, poor public services and four years of disappointing growth tainting Rousseff.
For months Rousseff, 66, a former guerrilla who was jailed and tortured for fighting the country s 1964-1985 dictatorship, looked poised to coast to an easy victory.
However, the race was dramatically altered on August 13 when the third-place Socialist candidate Eduardo Campos was killed in a plane crash and replaced by Silva for the presidential bid.
The proponents of change are now split between Silva, 56, and Neves, 54, from the powerful Social Democratic Party, which ruled the country from 1995 to 2002.
Silva, who belongs to Brazil s surging Evangelical Christian community and says she wants to be the diverse country s first  poor, black president,  was initially projected to beat Rousseff in a runoff, but has now slipped back into the spot Campos occupied before his death.
Neves has, meanwhile, closed the 20-percentage-point gap that separated him from Silva barely a month ago, re-emerging as the top contender to face Rousseff in the second round.

Brazil s President Dilma Rousseff looks on during a welcoming ceremony for EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso before a meeting at the Alvorada Palace in Brasilia July 18, 2014.
BRASILIA  Reuters  - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff until recently appeared to be cruising towards re-election in October but she now finds herself in a tight race as an already sluggish economy takes a turn for the worse.
Economic growth, slow for most of her term, looks even less promising this year with economists expecting a contraction in the second quarter.
5 percent and employment figures, long one of the bright spots in Latin America s biggest economy, recently began to show trouble.
Industrial output has slumped for the last three months and is on track to shrink more the 1 percent this year, prompting some manufacturers to start cutting jobs.
Frustration in Brazil s biggest cities is also mounting.
Poor public services and traffic gridlock, both factors that helped lead to mass demonstrations across Brazil last year, make daily life for many an increasingly unbearable slog.
While many Brazilians are still thankful to Rousseff s leftist Workers  Party for two previous terms of sustained economic growth, what had been unflinching support for her government has recently begun to slip.
Rousseff does not have enough votes to win the Oct.
5 election outright, according to figures released by pollster Datafolha on Friday.
And her main challenger, centrist Aecio Neves, has narrowed her lead in a likely second-round runoff from 27 percentage points in February to just 4 points, a statistical tie.
A separate poll released Saturday by the Sensus polling institute also shows the election headed to a runoff, with Rousseff and Neves tied in a second round.
The numbers have energized the Neves camp, giving it an array of issues to exploit on the campaign trail.
Senator Aloysio Nunes, Neves  running mate, told Reuters on Monday.
If Neves can pull off an upset, investors expect a return to the business-friendly policies that paved the way for the economic boom that Brazil enjoyed last decade.
He has pledged to restore Brazil s fiscal credibility by reining in public spending without sacrificing the social welfare programs that are so popular with Rousseff s base.
As they head into intense campaigning for the next two months, both Neves and Eduardo Campos, a dark-horse upstart candidate from another left-leaning party, will focus on the negatives that have begun to rattle the foundations of Rousseff s support.
Rousseff s worst enemy is not Aecio Neves.
Thiago de Aragão, a partner at Arko Advice consultancy in Brasilia.
Those numbers, analysts say, mean that many Campos voters, if he gets eliminated in the first round of voting, are likely to turn to Neves in the runoff.
The Datafolha poll showed that the number of Brazilians who say they will never vote for Rousseff is up to 35 percent, double that of Neves, while 29 percent now rate her government bad or terrible, worse than at the peak of last year s protests.
The anger from those protests did not spill over into Brazil s hosting of the recent World Cup football tournament, an event that was widely praised in sporting terms and which did little to harm Rousseff because it unfolded with few of the logistical nightmares that many expected.
Still, the tournament was perceived to go smoothly largely because Brazil declared holidays in host cities around most games, ensuring less of the chaos that regularly cripples Brazil s streets, trains and airports.
As voters refocus on daily issues from which they were distracted because of the World Cup, urban angst could manifest itself at the ballot box.
Jose Augusto Guilhon Albuquerque, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo.
To make matters worse for Rousseff, the coalition that sustains her government in Congress is tenuous because some smaller parties are angry with her Workers  Party, which routinely balks at requests from allies for key administration posts.
Even if they are nominally on board with her campaign at the national level, many will back other parties in state and mayoral races, fuelling tensions that could further undermine her overall support.
To be sure, Rousseff has some heavy artillery to roll out in the months ahead.
In addition to the rich campaign coffers and marketing muscle of the Workers  Party, she will enjoy ample TV time for campaign spots under Brazilian electoral law.
She also enjoys the backing of her mentor and predecessor as president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a legendary campaigner and still Brazil s most popular politician.
Worried about Rousseff s slide in the polls, Lula has called on her campaign to aggressively tout the reduction in poverty and other social gains that Brazil has seen under the Workers  Party.
During Lula s two terms, the Workers  Party received considerable campaign contributions from some of Brazil s largest businesses, happy with a booming economy and an expanding consumer market.
But Brazil s business class dislikes Rousseff for what they consider her heavy-handed intervention in the economy.
Her policies, they argue, have cut profit margins, discouraged investment and made Brazil less competitive.
Though most companies will hedge their bets and contribute financing to all candidates, Brazilian markets have increasingly shown how much they hope for a Rousseff loss.
The Bovespa stock index has risen more than 25 percent since mid-March, when Rousseff s popularity first began to weaken.
Neves has struck a chord with investors by pledging to refrain from meddling in the affairs of state-controlled firms like oil giant Petrobras, whose finances have been severely weakened under a Rousseff administration policy that forces the company to sell fuel below market prices.
The election now looks so close that experts in Brazilian politics are holding off predicting an outcome.
I don t know who will win,  said Vera Chaia, a politics professor at Sao Paulo s Catholic University.  Up to a month ago, before the World Cup, I thought she could win.
This discussion is now closed.
We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication.
The face of power in Brazil is becoming ever more diverse.
The top two candidates in Brazil’s presidential race on Sunday are both leftists and women, one of whom is black.
They are President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers’ Party and Afro-Brazilian environmentalist Marina Silva.
The private sector’s preferred candidate, a white man from Brazil’s once-dominant center-right party, trails in the polls.
If Rousseff and Silva go head-to-head in a run-off, as expected, voters will choose between competing progressive agendas.
This would leave the country’s business community without a serious contender for the first time since the country’s transition to democracy in 1985.
To a large extent, this is the business community’s own doing — the result of its continuing refusal to accept the country’s redistributive social policies and the expansion of rights that has transformed the country and lifted tens of millions of Brazilians out of poverty.
By now, business leaders should have formulated a more forward-looking strategy for political engagement.
It has been more than a decade since leftist Luis Inácio Lula da Silva won the presidency, overcoming opposition from domestic and international investors.
He went on to improve the lives of the poor through cash grants and economic growth.
Yet, the business elite still has no political strategy to deal with mass protests and fair elections at a time when Brazilians have gained increasing confidence in their power.
Last year, they took to the streets in large numbers to demand better public services and more accountable government.
This does not have to be the case.
One need not look far for alternative models.
As part of a transnational research project called Enduring Reform, my colleagues and I interviewed business leaders in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico about progressive reforms in their cities.
We wanted to know how they responded to reforms that improved the lives of marginalized citizens, a key index of the vitality of democracy.
We found a surprising and new accommodation to progressive projects in Argentina and Mexico.
For example, Argentine business owners who had commercial relationships with worker-run factories changed their previously harsh view of workers.
New experiences led them to value the skill and trustworthiness of workers who had illegally seized factories and ran them without bosses.
In San Cristóbal de las Casas, Mexico, elites who several decades ago refused to countenance the presence of indigenous persons even overnight in their city now tolerate and at times promote the inclusion of indigenous people in commerce, politics and urban planning The migration of tens of thousands of indigenous Mexicans to San Cristóbal’s periphery, together with an armed indigenous rebellion in the city and surrounding towns, convinced elites to reconsider fundamentally their past racism and exclusionary practices.
This contrasts with attitudes in Brazil, where the business community still acts to oppose or limit progressive reform in its cities, according to our study.
In Porto Alegre, business leaders steadfastly opposed participatory budgeting, a landmark program that turned over decision-making about municipal infrastructure to ordinary citizens.
Their reasons for doing so sound undemocratic.
There are 10 of them and one of us,” one businessman said, referring to the relative numbers of poor and well-off citizens at one participatory-budgeting neighborhood meeting.
Such attitudes fly in the face of Brazil’s changing times.
Through this democratic participation, Brazil is seeking to foster inclusion, lessen the income gap, and promote environmental sustainability.
Brazilian business leaders can’t stop this progress.
If they use their economic clout and disproportionate political voice to limit it, they will remain politically marginalized and scrambling to have a say, as they look to be in the presidential election.
Alternatively, they can listen, learn, present their own innovative proposals to be debated and voted on, and move forward with their fellow citizens to create a new model of democracy and growth for the 21st century.

Silva was thrust into the Socialist Party’s presidential nomination when its candidate of choice, Eduardo Campos, died in a plane crash last month.
Since then, her anti-establishment profile has propelled her to a neck-and-neck race with Brazil President Dilma Rousseff, who is seeking re-election.
But if President Dilma Rousseff fails to fight off the surging candidacy of reform-minded Marina Silva before presidential voting in October, South America s largest economy could reset its focus.
Silva was thrust into the Socialist Party s presidential nomination when its candidate of choice, Eduardo Campos, died in a plane crash last month.
Since then, her anti-establishment profile has propelled her to a neck-and-neck race with Rousseff.
Silva says she would re-emphasize ties to the United States and Europe, mostly by working to land trade deals with each.
Such moves could cause tension with Mercosur, which prohibits members from making bilateral deals without the group s approval.
Under Silva,  there will be a change of direction in foreign policy,  her top adviser Mauricio Rands told supporters at an event unveiling her proposals.
It would be a sharp change in direction for the proverbial slumbering giant.
Under Rousseff and her two-term predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil has given strong backing to leftist regional allies, such as Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia.
Rousseff beamed in January as she stood beside Cuban President Raul Castro at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to open the first phase of an overhaul of the Port of Mariel, which the Communist nation expects will become the largest industrial port in the Caribbean.
It was the clout of her government that persuaded Mercosur to set aside fears about possible violation of its democracy rules and welcome Venezuela into membership.
S.
Brazilian leader in two decades.
Her rebuff of the White House, made in protest of revelations the National Security Agency had spied on her communications, was the first in memory.
Rousseff had been sailing toward an expected victory before Silva s candidacy.
Now the two women are expected to claim the first two spots in the Oct.
5 vote, without either one winning an outright majority.
That would trigger a run-off vote three weeks later.
Most of her proposed changes would aim to lower tariffs, expand trade and revive Brazil s sputtering economy, which fell into recession this year after years of only feeble expansion.
Critics blame the stagnation on Rousseff s heavy state hand on the economy, replete with trade barriers and an unfriendly business environment.
The Mercosur bloc, which also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay as full members, has yet to sign any significant trade deals and infighting routinely hampers trade even within the group.
While Silva agrees a strong South America is still essential, her plan makes clear she would seek to pivot Brazil toward stronger ties with the broader global market and not be hobbled by its neighbors.
If Silva is elected,  Brazil, as a hemispheric power, will continue to maintain good relations with all the countries in the hemisphere,  said Riordan Roett, director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
Many expect Silva, a renowned environmentalist and human rights champion in the Amazon, to change Brazil s policies of largely ignoring alleged abuses in allies like Venezuela and Cuba.
But others argue her hands may be tied by heavy, ongoing investments with those countries.

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected on the narrowest of margins on Sunday, winning a second term on a platform of expanding social programs and further reducing inequality.
Ms.
4 for her right-of-centre challenger Aecio Neves.
Ms.
Rousseff swept some regions – particularly in the poor northeast – and lost badly in others, such as the capital, Brasilia, and the country’s largest and most prosperous state, Sao Paulo.
Mr.
Neves, the scion of an elite political family, swept the conservative and developed south of the country.
Brazilian society hasn’t been this divided since 1989,” the year of the first democratic election after the dictatorship, said Maria do Socorro Braga, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Sao Paulo.
The numbers are extremely close.
In her acceptance speech, Ms.
Rousseff struck an unusual note of conciliation and humility: “My first commitment in this second term is dialogue,” she said.
Re-election is a vote of hope – especially that we will govern better – that’s what I heard from the ballot box.
And she insisted the country could unite around the results.
From the bottom of my heart, I don’t believe that these elections have divided the country.
But challenges await her: First, and quickly, Ms.
Rousseff will have to alter her economic policy because she has been openly repudiated by the business sector.
Because it was so tight, she’s going to have to open up and listen to them, add their demands to their program,” Prof.
Braga said.
Ms.
Rousseff has said she will change her finance minister, but refused to name a new candidate thus far.
There is speculation she may do so overnight, so that a business-friendly minister is in place when the markets open on Monday, to avert the dive that was seen when she pulled ahead in polls a few weeks ago.
On her watch, Brazil’s once vibrant economy has stalled and lately slipped into recession, while inflation has crept steadily up.
Ms.
Rousseff is also going to have to accommodate the hard-left of her party – from which she had distanced herself in her first term, but whose shoe-leather campaigning played a critical role in getting her elected – and also young people who are loyal to the party but are demanding better public services.
She faces the challenging task of trying to cobble together a governing coalition in a congress that contains 28 different parties, but she may get a boost from the fact that many will want the privileges that come with joining the party in power.
I think the fact that people have decided to leave the  in power for 16 years, double what the opposition had, means she’s going to be a very strong president with a lot of legitimacy,” said Antonio Carlos Alkmim, a political scientist with the Pontifical Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro.
Her great challenge will be to fix problems with management of the economy and corruption, her two points of weakness in this election,” he added.
A still-unfolding corruption scandal at the national energy company Petrobras – and how much Ms.
Rousseff knew about alleged embezzlement – emerged as a critical issue in the last days of the campaign.
Many voters demonstrated their frustration with the choice of candidates: More than 20 per cent opted not to vote at all  although voting is mandatory and those who cannot produce a valid excuse must pay a fine  and seven million people cast blank or nullified votes.
These two, they are just two faces on the same puppet, they both work for the people who have the money and control everything in this country,” said Leonardo Nunes, a construction worker in the city of Niteroi who did not vote.
Mr.
Neves’ Brazilian Social Democratic Party had the solid support of Brazil’s private sector and its upper middle class.
I’m in favour of power of changing hands, because the perpetuation of the same government for so many years creates the space for the corruption scandals we’re seeing now,” said Anna Frota, 41, a public servant who voted in the leafy Rio neighbourhood of Gavea.
I disagree with the way the  is friendly with countries that are dictatorships like Cuba and Venezuela.
But in the end it was the 30 million Brazilians who have seen their lives improve dramatically under successive Workers’ Party governments whose votes carried the day.
I’m voting for Dilma because everything got more accessible during the last few years,” said Willians Dias, 42, who parks cars and collects rubbish in Rio.
Now poor people can have phones, they can have cars: I got two jobs and I managed to buy my house.

Brazil’s presidential race looks set for a second round after Dilma Rousseff failed to gain an outright majority in Sunday’s first round of voting.
The incumbent picked up 42 percent of the vote and will face centre-right rival Aecio Neves, who garnered 34 percent, in the run off.
The gloves are now off ahead of the October 26 ballot as both candidates look to persuade supporters of green leaning Marina Silva to vote for them.
The former environment minister polled a significant 21 percent of the vote and though out of the race she may well hold the balance of power.
The former favourite is due to meet with others to discuss which candidate to endorse.
The country now has a clear choice between the business friendly  Neves and the ‘soft Socialism’ of Rousseff.
Over the past two years Brazil has been hit by recession and protests over the poor state of the country’s infrastructure and the expense involved in hosting the World Cup.
ENCORE!
An acrimonious and volatile presidential race has entered its final stretch in Brazil, with left-wing incumbent Dilma Rousseff and conservative challenger Aecio Neves running neck and neck ahead of a run-off.
Over 140 million Brazilians will be voting on Sunday, with Rousseff of the Worker’s Party  PT  fighting to win a second term and Neves desperate to avoid a fourth consecutive defeat at the ballot box for his centre-right Party of Brazilian Social Democracy  PSDB .
Rousseff appears to have regained the momentum just days ahead of the October 26 election, after opinion polls showed she had slipped behind Neves last week.
Brazilian polling firm Datafolha revealed on Wednesday that Rousseff was on track to win 52 percent of the votes that will be cast on Sunday, with Neves set to claim 48 percent support – a margin within the study’s margin of error.
This election has been marked by unusual political vulnerability ,” said Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Uncertainty over the outcome has been heightened after pollsters’ stark failure to predict the results of the first round of the election on October 5.
Their surveys overestimated Rousseff’s lead sometimes by as much as 10 points, and wrongly predicted Neves would be squeezed out of the runoff by Socialist Party candidate Marina Silva .
A particularly rancorous campaign between Rousseff, 66, and Neves, 54, is therefore set to end with a photo finish – one that could force their respective camps to ask difficult questions about their futures.
Brazil’s strongest party following the dark years of military rule, the PSDB is credited for reining in the country’s runaway inflation in early 1990s.
But then it watched from the sidelines as Brazil enjoyed an economic fiesta under PT president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s two terms in office.
5 trillion by harnessing the country’s vast natural resources.
The PSDB lost a third-straight election in 2010, powerless against massively popular Lula da Silva’s hand-picked candidate, Rousseff .
According to the Wilson Center’s Sotero, the PSDB has found in Neves a candidate strong enough to finally bring the Lula-Rousseff era to a close.
Neves is younger than past PSDB candidates.
He has a lot of experience, but he is also energetic and connects with people.
Listening to other PSDB leaders sometimes felt like being in a sociology class, you know, boring,” the Brazilian analyst joked.
Sotero agreed that Sunday’s election was easily the PSDB’s best shot at reclaiming the presidency since Lula da Silva pushed them out of the Planalto Palace in Brasilia 12 years ago.
Neves, who was polling as little as 14 percent support in early September, has become the revelation of the race.
But a loss would, in many ways, take the PSDB back to square one.
Life after Lula?
A defeat could be even more devastating for the ruling Worker’s Party.
The left-wing party would leave with heads held high, after presiding over a decade in which 36 million Brazilians were raised out of poverty in a country of around 200 million people.
They would also have to pack up blame for mismanaging the economy and allowing the country to slip into recession earlier this year.
4 percent next year, only behind Argentina and Venezuela among South American economies.
Voters impatient with the slowdown could punish Rousseff at the ballot box, and send the PT scrambling to find a new leader to rally around.
The current campaign has been full of speculation about an eventual Lula da Silva comeback in four year’s time, and a Rousseff defeat on Sunday would only intensify the guessing game.
Sotero points out that Lula da Silva, who survived throat cancer last year, will be turning 73 when the next presidential election rolls around, and that within the PT there seems to be no obvious successor to lead the party he founded.
Sotero asked.
Who to lead Brazil?
President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected on Sunday after a tight runoff vote against a centrist challenger.
Brazil s leftist candidate secured a slim majority of the vote against Aecio Neves, as her anti-poverty program proved too popular for his pro-business platform.
6 percent against Neves with more than 99 percent of votes in.
Rousseff s election marks a continuation of her Worker s Party in control of Brazil s executive branch, which it has held since 2003.
In São Paulo, the capital of Brazil s wealthiest state, where Neves s Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  enjoys a large following, the mood was subdued.
In Brasilia, Rousseff took the stage in front of red banners emblazoned with photos from her days as a militant fighting the military dictatorship.
Rousseff became the country s first woman president after her election in 2010.
Born into an upper-class family, she became a socialist after the 1964 coup and was arrested and reportedly tortured by the regime.
In her speech Sunday, she expressed her gratitude to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who she served as chief of staff during his second presidential term and who tipped her to run in 2010.
Support: Rousseff became the country s first woman president after her election in 2010.
9 percent.
But the pace of growth slowed under Rousseff, who has been criticized for intervening too often in the Brazilian economy, leading to unpredictability in the market.
Rousseff has also been blamed for deteriorating public services, like healthcare, and numerous incidents of corruption, notably a bribery scandal involving the state-run Petroleo Brasileiro.
There is one easy way to put an end to corruption: throw the Workers  Party out of office,  Neves insisted during the final debate between the candidates on Friday.
Brazil s investor class has been cold on Rousseff, and Brazil s markets took a tumble on poll results showing she was likely to win the runoff.

Leave it to Petroleo Brasileiro SA s experts to finesse the engineering.
Last month, federal police heard key testimony in a corruption scandal that broke earlier this year and has since soiled the name of Brazil s biggest company, spread to the highest offices in Brasilia and driven the news cycle ahead of this Sunday s presidential elections.
The star witness is Petrobras s former refinery director Paulo Roberto Costa, who evidently did much more in his corner office than keep the pumps primed.
Costa was arrested in March and admitted to taking part in a massive money-laundering and overbilling scheme that allegedly used the Brazilian oil major to divert hundreds of millions of dollars to political allies of President Dilma Rousseff.
If not for some diligent sleuths, the case might have ended up as one more political mud-fest, ultimately tidied up by clever lawyers and a pact of silence among thieves.
25 billion and later forced the company to write off $500 million.
And there was more .
Costa went on to describe how Brazil s signature multinational had basically been converted into a giant ATM, tapping clients to fund political campaigns, including allegedly Rousseff s.
Shocking as all this may be, it s not even the worst news for Petrobras.
More troubling are the decisions taken by the light of day in Brasilia, where policy makers drunk on resource populism have been busy turning bounty into liability.
Today Petrobras is considered the most indebted publicly traded oil company, its market value down 58 percent since 2010.
To appreciate the problem, go back 20 years.
To rescue a failing economy, then-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso sold off scores of profligate state companies, ended Petrobras s monopoly and invited foreign investors to bid for drilling concessions.
Capital poured in and national oil output grew by 7 percent a year from 1997 to 2010, legislative oil analysts Ailton Braga and Luiz Bustamante wrote recently in an article for Valor Economico.
Then greed and government got in the way.
Convinced that recovering Brazil s ultra-deepwater oil was a  low-risk  operation, Cardoso s successor renationalized the business.
Lula welcomed foreign contractors, but subordinated them to Petrobras, the sole operator in the so-called pre-salt oil fields.
Local content rules obliged prospectors to buy overpriced Brazilian equipment.
But no matter.
The fortune salted away under the sea had become a metaphor for Brazil s hidden virtues.
2 billion in 2010,  behind only Exxon Mobil,  Petrobras announced.
Lottery ticket in hand, President Lula hit the road, talking up the world s newest energy frontier.
Then the music stopped.
Drilling auctions were halted, as lawmakers squabbled over imaginary royalties and regulators rebuilt the walls around Petrobras.
Production stagnated.
To damp inflation, Rousseff capped fuel prices, stoking fuel consumption and forcing Petrobras to eat the loss.
No wonder every time Rousseff climbs in the voter polls, Petrobras shares tank.
The damage spread to the nation s pioneering ethanol sector, where clean-burning fuel distilled from sugarcane can t compete with subsidized gasoline, threatening a wave of bankruptcies .
More than energy assets are at stake.
Petrobras s rise was once an emblem of the new Brazil and a model for Latin America.
When Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto s advisers drew up sweeping energy reforms , they looked to Petrobras and Brazil s reforms 20 years ago.
Now Petrobras has become the model to avoid.

NYSE: PBR  is getting to demonstrate all over again just how bad it is when a nation is under a socialist regime.
The oil giant known as Petrobras has seen its American depositary shares  ADSs  in New York get pounded Monday morning on news that Dilma Rousseff won the reelection in Brazil.
We have pondered of late just how much the shares of Petrobras were treated as a parabolic barometer of how the election polls were looking.
Now it turns out that Dennis Gartman’s prediction was correct: Rousseff’s opponent had no chance of victory.
4% over the center-right candidate Aecio Neves.
As far as why Petrobras is such an extreme barometer, it is a state-run oil company in which profit and growth take a backseat to the country’s population.
Petrobras has its terms dictated to it: it has to pay to drill the oil and does not decide what it can sell the oil and finished products for.
There is a huge preferred issue as well, and the common shareholders are crammed so far down in the right for income that it is a wonder why anyone would invest in the company.
Sadly, Petrobras could be one of the greatest oil companies in the world.
It has vast reserves, and it has yet to really capitalize by being a big international oil supplier on the world markets.
Its state-run status keeps it in the dirt.
Petrobras shares had already sold off around 40% from the highs of September, based on the expectation that Rousseff would win in her reelection bid.

The incumbent is fighting for reelection in a tight race.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is entering a runoff against challenger Aecio Neves in this year s presidential election.
On Sunday voters in Brazil head to the polls for a second time to decide if the country will continue the populist policies of President Dilma Rousseff or turn right towards a more austere government.
Because neither Rousseff nor her challenger, Aecio Neves, won 50 percent of the vote in September s first round, they ll face one another again in the runoff.
The race remains a tossup: polls conducted this week had the two running neck-and-neck.
Each candidate is ahead in different surveys : an Oct.
23 Datafolha poll shows Rousseff ahead 49 percent to Neves’ 42 percent, but a Sensus poll from the same day has Neves ahead 48 percent to Rousseff’s 40 percent.
A member of the Workers’ Party, Rousseff has continued the policies of her popular predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
While being credited as having lifted 36 million people out of poverty, Neves, a member of the Social Democratic Party, argues that the social welfare strategy has damaged the Brazilian economy and slowed growth.
You’re fairly evenly split between voters that believe that Brazil has gone to the wrong direction and a changed government is necessary, and another that firmly believes that the government in place is still the best option,” says Oliver Stuenkel, an assistant professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Brazil.
S.
Many recognize that the country is much better off today than it was when the Social Democratic Party was in power, due in part to the success of the Workers’ Party s Bolsa Familia program, which gives direct financial aid to the poor and is credited with elevating millions to the middle class.
The current government argues that return to opposition party would be a return to the bad times of the past,” Stuenkel says.
Aecio Neves.
Rousseff has made public programs like Bolsa Familia the hallmark of her administration.
A former Marxist guerilla, she served under Lula and was handpicked as his successor.
She typically finds support in Brazil’s poorest states, while Neves - who promises to reduce spending and decrease the size of the government - finds his backers among wealthier voters.
Both were born in the southern state of Minas Gerais, where Neves was governor until 2010 and is currently a senator.
He comes from a political family: his grandfather was elected president in 1985 but died before taking office.
White House meeting with President Obama last year after it became public that the National Security Agency was spying on the Brazilian government.
They took to the streets in 2013 to protest a raise in public transit fares, and the demonstrations expanded to include dissatisfaction with inflation, political corruption and lack of social services.
The protests were publicized worldwide as the country was poised to host the 2014 World Cup; preparations for that event ran billions over budget and finished far behind schedule.
There were fears further protests staged during the tournament could derail its success, but the soccer-crazed nation remained focused on the sport, not politics.
But Western California School of Law Professor James Cooper says some Brazilians are still unhappy the government spent so much for such a fleeting purpose.
People are coming off a hangover after the World Cup realizing that a lot of public funds went into the infrastructure,” Cooper says, referring to billions spent to upgrade transportation and build facilities to accommodate international visitors.
The Socialist Party’s Marina Silva, the third place candidate in the first round, endorsed Neves, but supporters aren’t likely to coalesce behind one candidate.
She entered the election late after her party’s presidential candidate was killed in a plane crash in August.
Voting is mandatory in Brazil, although those who don t wish to cast a ballot for either candidate may leave it blank.

Long-term foreign investors are growing more optimistic about Brazil no matter who wins this month s presidential election but they say an opposition victory could unleash a flood of new money.
The tight and fast-changing election campaign has sent Brazil s financial markets on a wild ride with big gains whenever leftist President Dilma Rousseff loses ground in polls and slides whenever her re-election bid seems stronger.
Rousseff s economic policies have been roundly criticized by investors for tipping Brazil into a recession while damaging state-run companies such as oil producer Petrobras and lender Banco do Brasil along the way.
Her business-friendly opposition rival Aecio Neves has promised stronger fiscal control and less government intervention in state firms if he is elected, winning the support of most market players.
Beyond the swings of a neck-and-neck race, however, long-term sentiment on Brazil has improved.
Investors are betting that either Neves will win the runoff on Oct.
26 or that Rousseff, chided by a very narrow margin of victory, will adopt more market-friendly policies in a second term.

After hitting a five-year low in mid-March, the benchmark Bovespa stock index has since gained more than 20 percent and is up over 5 percent in 2014 - by far the best performer among key Latin American bourses.

Echoing other long-term investors, Rozin said it  pays to wait and see how things play out  but noted that a Neves victory would sharply improve the value of state-run companies that have suffered under Rousseff s heavy hand.

Pragmatic Rousseff?
Since August, when the death of presidential candidate Eduardo Campos in a plane crash upended the election race, investing in Brazil s stock market has been akin to riding a bucking bull, with sharp drops and jumps dictated by voter opinion polls.
Though traders expect the market to sell off heavily in the short term if Rousseff is re-elected, long-term investors aren t preparing to run for the hills.
The odds of a more open-minded Rousseff administration, they argue, increased after the strong showing of opposition parties in the election s first round.

While these investors do not expect a second Rousseff government to foster a strong economic recovery, they believe she could implement some badly-needed policy adjustments to rein in inflation and win back some credibility among investors and credit ratings agencies.
Even those who are unconvinced that the president would change tack in a second term say Brazil will continue to offer interesting growth opportunities regardless.

Voters will choose between incumbent Dilma Rousseff and Aecio Neves, with the latest polls giving the president a slight lead.
Nearly 143 million people are expected to go to the polls in Brazil s presidential election run-off today.
The conservative elite are threatening to kick the left out of power after 12 years.
Voters will choose between incumbent Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party and Social Democratic Party rival Aecio Neves.
The latest polls give Ms Neves a slight lead.
The challenges for whoever wins will be to fight inflation which is creeping up and boost the economy that has slowed down in the last couple of years.
Ms Rousseff, 66, is a former Marxist guerrilla who fought military dictatorship and was imprisoned and tortured in the 1970s.
Her 54-year-old opponent, from an aristocratic family, has been trying to shed his playboy reputation.
Mr Neves is the grandson of the first president who was elected democratically in 1985 but who died before he could take office.
As the last presidential debate started on Friday, a right-wing news magazine, Veja, published a corruption claim on its front page.
A former executive at Petrobras testified he had accepted bribes on behalf of the energy firm to give lucrative contracts to dozens of construction companies.
And he claimed he handed over some of the cash to Lula and Ms Rousseff s Worker s party  PT  and close allies.
Ms Rousseff has been trying to appeal to the business supporters of Mr Neves, and he in turn has promised to keep the welfare plan  bolsa familia  which helps nearly three million low income families.
All Brazilians aged between 18-70 have to vote, and in the fifth largest country in the world all polling stations have  electronic urns .

The country is divided in two, with half feeling that social inclusion and protections are what matter most, and the other half believing that macroeconomic stability is more important,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think-tank .
The race turned dramatic after Eduardo Campos, a main opposition candidate, was killed when his campaign plane crashed in August.
His running mate, renowned environmentalist Marina Silva, was thrust into his spot, and she immediately jumped to a double-digit lead over Rousseff and Neves.
Silva initially tapped into the discontent over poor public services that millions of Brazilians expressed in anti-government protests last year, but her campaign never found its feet and voters drifted away from her within weeks.
That opened the gap for Neves to stage his surprisingly strong showing in the Oct.
5 first-round vote, coming in second and forcing Rousseff into a runoff when her first-place finish didn’t get an absolute majority.
The campaigns hit fever pitch in the three weeks since, with the Workers’ Party that’s been in power for 12 years and Neves’ Social Democracy Party that last held the presidency in 1995-2003 battling it out with no shortage of verbal jabs and nasty allegations.
Rousseff attacked her rival with campaign ads asking Brazilians to remember the “ghosts of the past” when Neves’ party ruled, with much of the nation mired in poverty, unemployment rife, and consumers crippled by hyperinflation.
The incumbent has emphasized the deep social gains made under the Workers’ Party, whose expansive social welfare programs helped yank millions out of poverty and into the middle class and have kept unemployment at historic lows.
5 per cent target, and allegations that the Workers’ Party was involved in an apparent decade-long, billion-dollar kickback scheme at state-run oil company Petrobras.
The latest results from Brazil’s two most respected polling groups put Rousseff ahead of Neves.
A Datafolha survey released Thursday had Rousseff leading Neves 53 per cent to 47 per cent, with an error margin of two percentage points.
An Ibope Institute poll put the president’s lead 54-46, with the same error margin.
I’m voting for Dilma because the Workers’ Party has made life easier for the poor.
I still live in a slum, but now my home is full of nice, modern things – I’ve got a TV, a new refrigerator and air conditioning,” said Ana Paula Marinho, a nurse who lives in the Pavao-Pavaozinho favela that sits above Copacabana’s ornate apartments.
But Patricia Botelha, who lives on a leafy street in Rio’s wealthy Ipanema neighbourhood, said Rousseff’s poor management had led Brazil’s economy to weak growth and all Brazilians will pay the price if the country doesn’t rebound soon.
While she voted for the Workers’ Party in the last three elections, this year she’s casting a ballot for Neves.
Associated Press writer Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.
The 2014 Brazilian elections have demonstrated a series of extraordinary events.
Since the end of the authoritarian military dictatorship almost 30 years ago, ordinary Brazilians have increasingly participated in the country’s democratic political process.
The practice of politicians “buying votes” with the help of blackmail, along with false promises has become increasingly rare as Brazilians are better informed about their candidates and less skeptical about the country’s electoral system.
It is not as easy to manufacture political support as it was in the past.
While Brazil has many political parties, two parties in particular have come to dominate the Brazilian political stage – one leaning left while the other leans to the right.
Americans will find this scenario all too familiar, as in the United States; only the two main parties have been able to vie for higher political positions.
This bipolar arrangement makes consensus difficult within Brazil’s governing institutions.
In this election, a center-left party, the Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB , was ahead by 9% in recent polls.
However, with the death of its presidential candidate, Eduardo Campos, in a tragic plane crash, the hopes for change has become far out of reach.
The majority of non-elite Brazilians had been dreaming for the left to gain power for decades.
2] Luis Inácio Lula da Silva— known as ‘Lula’—provided Brazil with a burst of programs to improve social and economic equality as well as raise living standards.
3] When Lula endorsed Dilma Rousseff as his successor in 2010, the people hoped Rousseff would follow the work of her mentor with the same intensity.
However, Rousseff has managed to disappoint PT supporters by failing to live up to the ideology, charisma and leadership style of her predecessor.
4] Lula’s social reforms, included increasing access to higher education, strengthening the middle class, and improving opportunities for students from lower class backgrounds.
It is ironic that these same students were protesting against Lula’s party while demanding improvements in the health, education, and security sectors as these were at the core of PT’s principles.
One factor that has puzzled many observers is that the catalyst of the protests was the bus fare rise, which is not directly related with the executive branch of the government.
Now, while some progressive voters say they will not vote for Dilma in Brazil’s upcoming October elections, many also say they would never vote for the right-wing opposition candidate either.
The country’s right wing is currently being represented by Aécio Neves from the PSDB.
Unlike the United States, in Brazil voting is compulsory.
So, where are voters who previously supported Rousseff’s ruling PT party going to place their votes?
6] At the same time, PSB surprisingly attracted high support, which was a first for a party outside of PT and PSDB.
For the first time, there was a possibility of a candidate from a small party becoming a viable contender in major national elections.
Unfortunately, however, PSB representative and former governor of Pernambuco  North East Brazil  Eduardo Campos, died in a plane crash on August 12.
What exactly does this mean for Brazil?
In reality, Campos was not likely to win the 2014 elections.
He was, however, a promising prospective candidate for the 2018 elections  or even later, given his young age of 49 years old , considering how much he was highly esteemed in his native state of Pernambuco where, ironically, PT is extremely popular.
7] Therefore it was likely that the PSB along with Eduardo Campos was going to take a significant number of votes away from Dilma in the North East region.
However, following his tragic death, the situation has shifted dramatically.
Although Campos offered strong hopes of bringing balance to Brazil’s electoral process, the nation has not appeared ready to break the cycle of bipolar parties.
During a recent forum at the Wilson Center, Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute, responded to Data Folha’s statement about the influence of the World Cup over the elections.
8] Additionally, certain public polls can be questionable, as a net result they tend to favor one party over the other.
The PSB fell into an almost incognito status with Campos’s death.
The party was initially reluctant to choose Mariana Silva, Campos’s vice presidential candidate, to replace his position.
However, the party has recently announced Silva as the presidential candidate for PSB.
Together, they campaigned for justice and equality in the social, economic and environmental arenas.
10] The fact that another party outside of PT and PSDB dominance might have the potential to be in the run-off of a presidential election would be historic.
If Silva does not run, Dilma might not even need to go to run-off as she can possibly win against Aécio in the first round.
Without a doubt, the loss of Campos is bad for the country and its democratic process as his death has the power to reduce the smaller but still potent parties that gave further balance and progressiveness to the Brazilian political system.
Now, the hopes are on Marina Silva to push forward for a broader political participation in Brazil where other parties can equally have representatives running for presidency.
Whether she wins or not, the path that both herself and Campos have set PSB is already an advantageous one for the Brazilian democracy.

Voters are heading to the polls Sunday for Brazil s general elections, with the presidency, congressional seats and regional posts up for grabs.
8 million people are eligible to vote in the election.
Voters will be casting ballots for the president, the governors of 27 states, two-thirds of the Senate s members and all 513 members of the lower house of Congress.
State legislative seats are also on ballots across Brazil.
Brazil will close two hours later because they are in different time zones.
President Dilma Rousseff, according to the polls released on Saturday, will win the election with 40 percent of the vote, while Social Democrat Aecio Neves and environmentalist Marina Silva, who are both receiving the support of about 24 percent of voters, will fight for second place.
Rousseff expressed confidence that she would come in first on Sunday, but she acknowledged that a run-off was a possibility.
Rousseff said after voting at Santos Dumont public school in Porto Alegre.
A run-off election will be held on Oct.
26 if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote.
Neves, who surged in the polls at the last minute and is the favorite to face Rousseff in the run-off, expressed confidence that he would advance to the run-off.
Neves said after voting in Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state.
Silva voted at the National Settlement and Agrarian Reform Institute, or Incra, office in Rio Branco, the city in the Amazonian state of Acre where she was born 56 years ago.
Silva said.
Rousseff will await the election results in Brasilia, while Neves will do so in Belo Horizonte and Silva will be in Sao Paulo as the results are released.
The results of exit polls will be available once all election precincts close, and the national elections commission plans to begin releasing preliminary official results soon after polling places close.
Security is tight in Rio de Janeiro, where officials hope to prevent the drug gangs that operate in the  favelas,  or shantytowns, from carrying out acts of violence, as well as in Sao Luiz and Florianopolis, the capitals of Maranhao and Santa Catarina states, respectively, where attacks on buses occurred recently.
The attacks in the two state capitals were blamed on the gangs that control the illegal drug trade inside prisons.
The gangs ordered the attacks on buses in reaction to measures taken to break their hold on the prisons, officials said.
With the first round now over, Brazil s presidential elections evoked intense emotions that even a Greek Tragedy could not conjure up.
There was the drama of protesters in 2013 whose expectations of greater support for education and jobs led to disaffection with the Labor government of President Dilma Rousseff.
And then there was tragedy.
Just two months before the October first round, Eduardo Campos, the candidate of the Socialist Party, died in a fiery plane crash.
Marina Silva, his running mate, took on the mantle of leadership.
And there was irony.
Pundits and pollsters who had thought that Silva was the rising star to defeat both the incumbent and the pro-business Social Democrat, Aecio Neves, were proven wrong.
When the polls closed Sunday night, Neves came in second.
A runoff election in what was described as a very tightly competitive campaign will mean that Rousseff, who won 42 percent of the vote, will compete with Neves.
And Silva s role will be to see whether she has enough political clout with her suppporters to push Neves, who came in second, with 34 percent of the vote, over the top if she endorses his candidacy over that of Rousseff.
Silva received 21 percent.
If this sounds too much like inside baseball, it probably is, except that as we approach election season in this country there are lessons we can learn from our Brazilian neighbors.
The first is that the wisdom of pollsters must be considered, but not used to anoint any one candidate.
Public opinion is volatile.
When the votes were counted Sunday night, the biggest losers were Brazil s pollsters and the many Washington pundits who were betting on a slam-down second round between Rousseff and Silva.
Unreliable polling data makes guessing the final outcome more of a parlor game, given how unreliable polling was in round one.
Chalk it up to Brazil s young democracy.
No Nate Silver has come to the rescue of the political parties this time.
Brazilians relied too much on the inadequate polling data that led them to believe that Silva would surge.
The pundits were so convinced of this that there were endless commentaries about her rise and what it would mean in Brazil.
The second lesson is that pocketbook issues matter.
The Labor Party s 12-year run launched social programs that lifted millions from poverty to the middle class.
The Bolsa Familiar ensured that millions would get to school, raising the expectations of an emerging group of citizens who now want even more.
The corruption scandals of Labor, however, coupled with the stagnant economy of the past two years, have also created even more dissatisfaction among Labor s supporters.
For voters, the choices were stark.
Do voters want four more years of the same social welfare policies that have only taken citizens to the edge of being part of the middle class?
Or do they want a government that will end corruption, endorse a less protectionist trade policy, and invest in education and infrastructure?
More than 10 points separated Dilma s votes from those of Neves, whose more free-market business approach took the more industrial regions of the country.
Silva s voters were limited to those in Brazil s northeast, her base for the Green Party, and in Acre, her native state.
Silva s Cinderella story is not to be discounted.
Rising from extreme poverty, the daughter of rubber tappers in the Amazonian state of Acre, she became a leading voice of Brazil s environmental movement, eventually joining the Labor government of former President Lula da Silva  no relation  as minister of the environment.
She later broke with Labor and ran as a Green Party candidate in 2009 against Lula s handpicked successor, Rousseff.
She lost.
But Silva s story is far from over as she may hold the key to the future of the presidency in Brazil.
A poll conducted the day before the election showed that 71 percent of her supporters would vote for Neves in a runoff.
Now Brazil s next president hangs in the balance as voters wait to see whom she will endorse.
The bigger question that you may be asking as your eyes glaze over these details is: Why should this election matter to the United States?
The answer is simple.
Brazil, the second-largest state in the Western Hemisphere, is a strong democracy with a tradition of respect for international law.
It works through international organizations like the United Nations, where its police and military have continued to support peacekeeping operations in Haiti and around the world.
Just as the United States is a leader for the countries of the Global North, so Brazil has assumed leadership in the Global South.
This is important in a world experiencing dynamic changes in the governance, security and trading relationships.
If the Oct.
S.
Brazil will need to continue a rebuilding of trust between both countries.
Last fall, after revelations about National Security Agency eavesdropping on Rousseff s cell phone conversations, she cancelled a much sought-after state visit to Washington.
The fallout from this event still haunts the bilateral relationship.
Both countries will need to work even harder to rebuild trust as regional events, including the Summit of the Americas scheduled for Panama in 2015, will reach a tipping point with the inclusion of Cuba as part of that process.
S.
Brazil, the leader of the South American Union, to reach some form of accommodation.
A victory of the Social Democrats, with Neves returning that party to office, would present another opportunity to revisit efforts to expand free trade agreements to the Southern Hemisphere.
S.
His party s record of economic reform, led by former President Fernando Enrique Cardoso, could usher in a period of greater focus on such priorities as building infrastructure and going beyond the social programs of the Labor Party.
Most important, Neves has also promised an end to the endemic corruption that has plagued his Labor Party colleagues for years.
South America has not been the focus of much attention in Washington.
The reasons are obvious when you have a hemisphere that is more peaceful and not stockpiled with nuclear weapons.
There may be challenging governments in the region who dislike United States policies on counterterrorism and narcotics, but these nations do not threaten other states.
If anything, Brazil and its neighbors have united together in their own subregional arrangements precisely to create a countervailing force to a region once dominated by the United States.
Of all the countries in South America, Brazil, as the largest and richest, is also poised to lead in the decades to come.
As part of the so-called BRICS  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa , Brazil is finding its voice as a leader of the Global South, a position that dominates its own foreign policy.
These types of relationships with other emerging economies are also an important part of the evolution of a region that is no longer the poor, underdeveloped neighbor that we often wrongly think of when we talk about South America.
While foreign policy issues are not a feature of this presidential election in Brazil, it seems certain that no matter who wins this race in round two, the winner will want to ensure that the long-term relationship with the United States evolves in a way that benefits respective interests.
Those include the mutual respect for democratic governance, protection of the environment and support for international law.
Fortunately, all those seeking the presidency share these common values, and any change will benefit us all.

Economic questions could end up deciding the Brazilian election.
But analysts say it won t work the other way round - economic development is unlikely to be affected by the outcome of the run-off.
For weeks now, both candidates for the Brazilian presidency have been firing off accusations at one another.
Corruption, nepotism, and lies were common allegations.
Brazilians have a fitting saying for it:  The dirty talking to the filthy.  But the mutual mudslinging won t decide the election, says political scientist Susanne Gratius of the think tank FRIDE.
2014 .
That could be an advantage for Neves, because Brazil s economy has stuttered during Rousseff s tenure.
Gross Domestic Product even shrank slightly in the first half of 2014.
3 percent has become particularly noticeable on goods that are necessary for daily use, and so disproportionately affects low income people.
And that is a lot of voters.
Player vs.
But the economy is also an exciting election issue because it is one of the few areas where candidates can really set themselves apart.
No one dares question social programs, and since the mass protests in 2013 it has become clear that infrastructure, health, and education sectors need to be expanded.
The question is: how can these things be financed?
Both candidates want to auction off concessions for private airports and long-distance roads.
But Rousseff wants to finance the building work from public banks, while Neves wants to see more private capital flow into such projects.
Put crudely, Dilma Rousseff sees the state as an economic player, while Aécio Neves sees it as a moderator.
The latter could be a more sustainable approach, because the economic downturn is also affecting tax revenue.
5 percent by the end of 2014, according to the Moody s ratings agency.
Intervention vs.
Neves also wants to see more private competition in the crude oil industry - he is even calling for a review of the license auctions of October 2013, when the government had reserved a 30 percent stake in the semi-state-owned oil company Petrobras.
That soon became 40 percent, partly because few other companies showed interest - which put a hole in state coffers, since the license was then sold for the minimum offer.
5 percent.
5 percent  in order to avoid a rise in unemployment and a sharpening of the recession.
Protectionism vs.
That danger is unavoidable if the central bank raises the base interest rate in order to stabilize the currency.
But Neves  riposte to that is a drastic simplification of the taxation of goods, which is very complicated in Brazil.
So complicated, that it is often named alongside corruption, poor infrastructure, and export tolls as a reason why foreign companies don t invest in Brazil.
In her four years as president, Rousseff has done very little in this regard and so has now suggested much more modest reforms.
That might also be because Brazil s international standing is not as important to the incumbent president as it is to Neves; Though in February Rousseff went to Brussels to meet EU Commissioners to talk about a free trade agreement, she will only sign it once she s made a deal with Brazil s Mercosur partners  Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela .
But the negotiations with the EU and Mercosur have barely moved forward since the end of the 90s.
And even within the Mercosur free trade alliance there is an impenetrable jungle of tolls and restrictions.
For that reason, Neves even mooted the end of Mercosur.
He sees Brazil joining the international economy at the side of the US and the EU.
Election campaigning vs.
Going by the electoral programs, Neves would be a more interesting candidate for the EU, says the political scientist Gratius.
But she warns,  What the head of state will actually be able to implement is another matter.  The biggest faction in the Brazilian congress is made up not of Rousseff s PT, nor of Neves  Social Democrats, but the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMBD  - whose representatives are not exactly known for their passion for reform.
The biggest hope for the Brazilian economy is probably the reliability of Brazilian democracy.
That s also how the actions of Moody s ratings agency could be read too: they released their prognosis for Brazil s credit rating four weeks before the first round of voting.
Three days later Moody s confirmed the implicit message with a declaration: Brazil s credit-worthiness does not depend on the result of the presidential election - the vital thing is how successful the next government will be in fighting the economic downward trend.
RIO DE JANEIRO  AP  - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected by the narrowest margin in three decades, handing her left-leaning Workers  Party its weakest mandate as it confronts some of the country s biggest challenges in years.
6 percent of the vote in a runoff against center-right challenger Aecio Neves on Sunday, Rousseff spoke of national reconciliation as she seeks to restart a stagnant economy, push political reform through a fragmented congress where she now has less support, and respond to widespread popular demands to improve woeful public services.
These frustrations sparked angry street demonstrations just a year ago.
In her victory speech, Rousseff said  dialogue  was the first promise for her second term - but it remains to be seen how much the opposition will cede to her ideas of a statist economy given that growth has stalled, though she has managed to keep unemployment at record lows.
The president said she understood demands for a more efficient, less corrupt government.
During the Workers  Party time in power, the government has enacted expansive social programs that have helped pull millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the middle class, transforming the lives of the poor.
But the globe s seventh-largest economy has underperformed since 2011, with some fearing it could put the social gains at risk.
Dilma has social inclusion on her side, but the macroeconomic policies during her first four years in office have been very weak,  said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil s leading think tank.  Inflation has returned, the country is in a technical recession and public spending is out of control.
The choice between Rousseff and Neves split Brazilians into two camps - those who thought only the president would continue to protect the poor and advance social inclusion versus those who were certain that only the contender s market-friendly economic policies could see Brazil return to solid growth.
Rousseff and Neves fought bitterly to convince voters that they could deliver on both growth and social advances.
This year s campaign was widely considered the most acrimonious since Brazil s return to democracy in 1985, a battle between the only two parties to have held the presidency since 1995.
Neves hammered at Rousseff over a widening kickback scandal Petrobras, with an informant telling investigators that the Workers  Party directly benefited from the scheme.
Rousseff rejected those allegations and told Brazilians that a vote for Neves would be support for returning Brazil to times of intense economic turbulence, hyperinflation and high unemployment, which the nation encountered when the Social Democrats last held power.
Rousseff said before voting in southern Brazil.
In Brazil s biggest city of Sao Paulo, thousands of Workers  Party supporters gathered on a main avenue, waving banners as a truck with giant speakers blasted Rousseff s campaign jingles.
I m very happy because I think the construction of Brazil has barely begun and now we will have continuity,  said Liliane Viana, a retired federal government worker.  I was afraid we were going to move backward.
Neves was a two-term governor in Minas Gerais state who left office in 2010 with a 92 percent approval rating.
He surged at the end of the presidential race to score a surprise second-place position and force a runoff vote against Rousseff.
Speaking from his hometown of Belo Horizonte, he thanked the  more than 50 million Brazilians  who voted for him.

In the wake of Brazilian presidential candidate Eduardo Campos’  death in a plane crash last week in Santos, Sao Paulo, there has been much discussion over who would succeed him as the Brazilian Socialist Party’s  PSB  candidate.
Now, it appears the PSB will officially announce Campos’ vice-presidential running mate Marina Silva’s candidacy at a meeting on Aug 20.
Although Silva’s succession to Campos seems logical—she was his vice-presidential candidate, after all—her path to the PSB was indirect.
Silva only joined Campos’ ticket after her attempt to register a new political party, the Sustainability Network, fell short of the authenticated signatures required last year .
In 2010, Silva ran for president on the Green Party ticket and came in at a respectable third place, having earned a reputation for tough efficiency as environment minister under former president Luis Inácio Lula da Silva.
More  than 700 people went to prison for environmental crimes   link in Portuguese  and deforestation slowed during her tenure.
But Silva very dramatically  resigned in 2008 , to protest Lula’s support of development in the rainforest.
Like president Dilma Rousseff, a former guerrilla who smuggled weapons and was brutally tortured during Brazil’s military dictatorship, Silva has an inspiring back story of overcoming adversity and becoming a leading activist before entering electoral politics.
She was born to a family of rubber-tappers in Acre, one of Brazil’s poorest states, in the Amazon.
She lost two of her 10 siblings to malaria, and was the only one to regularly attend school.
At age six, she contracted mercury poisoning—an affliction that still keeps her from shellfish, lactose, red meat, alcohol, and cosmetics.
At 16, barely literate and newly orphaned , she left home for the state capital, where she worked as a maid,  considered becoming a nun,  got a college education, and perhaps most importantly, met the now legendary  union and environmental activist , Chico Mendes.
With Mendes, himself a former rubber tapper, Silva helped establish a workers union for rubber tappers in Acre  to fight the destruction of their livelihood and home.
According to data collected last week by Brazilian polling institute, Datafolha , Silva stands a fighting chance of unseating incumbent president Dilma Rousseff  who was booed at Campos’ funeral on Sunday  come October.
Brazil’s voting system requires a candidate to win more than 50% of votes to avoid a second-round runoff; polls show Rousseff would get 36% and Silva 21%—just ahead of Brazilian Social Democracy party candidate Aécio Neves, and within the 2% margin of error.
Presented with Rousseff and Silva in a runoff, 47% of the 2,843 polled chose Silva, putting the two candidates just about neck-and-neck.
Final opinion polls Saturday showed leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff narrow favorite with a four- to six-point advantage over center-right business world choice Aecio Neves in the race to lead the world’s seventh-largest economy.
A former guerrilla jailed and tortured for fighting the country’s 1964-1985 military regime, Rousseff — Brazil’s first woman president — has needed all her battling qualities to claw back the advantage on Neves.
Sunday’s vote is widely seen as a referendum on 12 years of government by her Workers’ Party  PT  — eight under working-class hero Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and four under Rousseff, who has presided over four years of anaemic growth culminating in recession.
9 percent.
5 percent.
Rousseff, 66, has overseen rising inflation and a recession this year.
She also faced massive protests last year against corruption, record spending on the World Cup, and poor services, notably education, healthcare and transport.
She has further been battered by a multi-billion-dollar embezzlement scandal implicating dozens of politicians — mainly her allies — at state-owned oil giant Petrobras.
Rightwing news magazine Veja on Friday quoted a suspect in the case as saying Rousseff and Lula personally knew of the scam.
She roundly denied the claim and threatened to sue.
Before the October 5 first-round vote, Rousseff fended off environmentalist Marina Silva, who initially surged in opinion polls with her vow to become Brazil’s first “poor, black” president having dramatically entered the race after running mate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash.
No sooner had the PT electoral machine dispatched Silva — who exited the contest with 21 percent to Rousseff’s 42 percent and Neves’s 34 percent — than the incumbent had to beat back Neves, who having ousted Silva then opened a brief lead in surveys.
With the candidates fighting for every vote in this sprawling country of 202 million people, the campaign took on a level of animosity not seen since the return to democracy.
Rousseff accused Neves of nepotism as governor of Minas Gerais state, then played up a report he once hit his then-girlfriend in public.
And she suggested the Social Democrat was driving “drunk or on drugs” when he refused to take a breathalyzer during a 2011 traffic stop.
Neves, a 54-year-old senator and the grandson of the man elected Brazil’s first post-dictatorship president, responded in kind, accusing Rousseff of lying, incompetent economic management and “collusion” in the Petrobras kickbacks.
8 million voters enter election day divided along social lines.
Yet in reality, the two candidates don’t have widely differing policies — four years is quite a short time to turn the ship around,” Lia Valls, an economist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation specializing in Brazilian trade, told AFP.
While the poor back the PT, Brazil’s elite are exasperated with interventionist economic policies such as gasoline price controls and high taxes.
The key battleground is for votes in the industrialized southeast, the cradle of the million-strong protests last year where a growing middle class is making growing demands.
They are torn between voters loyal to the PT’s transformative social policies and those frustrated on the economy.
The country is divided, and whoever wins will need to reach out to the opposition,” said Lourdes Casanova, an emerging markets specialist at Cornell University in New York state.
Voters are also electing governors in run-offs in 14 states where no candidate took more than 50 percent in the first round.
Polls open at 8:00 am  1000 GMT in Rio  and results are expected shortly after the 5:00 pm close, thanks to a sophisticated electronic voting system.

SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters  - Brazil s leftist President Dilma Rousseff narrowly won re-election on Sunday after convincing voters that her party s strong record of reducing poverty over the last 12 years was more important than a recent economic slump.
4 percent with more than 99 percent of the votes tallied.
At a hotel in Brasilia where Rousseff was due to speak, party supporters waved red flags and jumped up and down, screaming in celebration.
In Sao Paulo, a stronghold of Neves  Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB , a more subdued mood was punctuated by some government supporters honking horns and screaming with joy.
Voting was peaceful and Brazil s robust democracy is free of the political violence that mars some other countries in Latin America.
The result means another four years in power for the Workers  Party, which since 2003 has virtually transformed Brazil - lifting 40 million from poverty, reducing unemployment to record lows and making big inroads against hunger in what remains one of the world s most unequal countries.
The party s star has faded recently.
The economy has slowed dramatically under Rousseff s heavy-handed and often unpredictable policies, making Brazil s glory days of robust growth last decade an ever-more distant memory.
Numerous corruption scandals, high inflation and frustration over poor public services like health care tempted many to consider a switch to Neves  more pro-business agenda.
Yet Rousseff and her supporters spent the campaign warning voters, especially the poor, that a vote for the PSDB would mean a return to the less compassionate, more unequal Brazil of the 1990s - an argument that Neves rigorously denied, but ultimately prevailed anyway.
Livia Roma, 19, a university student in Sao Paulo, as she voted on Sunday.
Investors have generally disliked Rousseff s interventionist management of state-run companies and other sectors of the economy, and Brazil s financial markets plummeted last week when polls showed she was likely to win a second term.
They could see another selloff on Monday.
With 200 million people and a gross domestic product of some $2 trillion, Brazil is Latin America s largest economy and its most populous country.
By re-electing Rousseff, it will remain on a middle ground between more socialist governments in Venezuela and Argentina, and the freer-trading, faster-growing countries on the Pacific coast that include Colombia and Chile.
Rousseff owed her victory to overwhelming support from the roughly 40 percent of Brazilians who live in households earning less than $700 a month.
They have benefited from the Workers  Party s rollout of a program that pays a small monthly stipend to one in four Brazilian families, as well as federal housing programs, government-sponsored vocational schools and an expansion of credit to the working class.
Rousseff, 66, is unlikely to enjoy much, if any, of a honeymoon when her second term starts on New Year s Day.
Recent allegations of systemic corruption at state-run oil giant Petrobras  roiled the final days of the campaign and are likely to be a major political headache in coming months and years as prosecutors pursue those responsible.
The economy slipped into a recession earlier this year, and ratings agencies have warned that a credit downgrade is possible unless Rousseff makes hefty spending cuts to correct deficits that have mushroomed in recent months.
Her aides have said she will try to win back the confidence of financial markets by announcing a more pragmatic finance minister for her second term, although many investors worry that Rousseff will continue to call most of the shots herself.
The election was one of the most dramatic since full democracy returned to Brazil in 1989.
One candidate was killed in a plane crash in August, and his replacement then soared into the lead in opinion polls, only to fade in the final days before the first round of voting on Oct.
5.
During the runoff, senior leaders from both parties compared their rivals to Nazis - a break from the relatively genteel tone that has prevailed in Brazilian politics in recent years, and one that analysts say heralds a more divisive era ahead.
That, in turn, may make consensus on a much-needed overhaul of the tax code and other economic reforms more difficult for Rousseff to push through.
Rousseff, who was jailed and tortured in the early 1970s for opposing that era s military dictatorship, is the country s first woman president.
The daughter of a Bulgarian aristocrat who emigrated to Brazil during World War Two, she was a relatively obscure government technocrat until her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hand-picked her as his successor.
Many in the Workers  Party are already thinking ahead to the next election in 2018, when Lula, who governed from 2003 to 2010, has said he may run again.
Brazil s constitution doesn t allow presidents to seek a third consecutive term.
Neves  PSDB, meanwhile, faces an uncertain future after falling short in three straight presidential contests due in part to its image as the party of Brazil s wealthy minority.
The PSDB is under added pressure because of a long drought in Sao Paulo state, which it governs, that has raised the prospect of severe water rationing in coming months.
Assembly: Brazil has a bicameral National Congress  Congresso Nacional  consisting of the Federal Senate  Senado Federal  with 81 seats and the Chamber of Deputies  Camara dos Deputados  with 513 seats.
The president is both the chief of state and head of government.
The President is elected by absolute majority vote through a two-round system to serve a 4-year term.
In the Federal Senate  Senado Federal                          81 members are                         elected                         by plurality vote in multi-member constituencies to serve 8-year terms*.
There are 27 multi-member  3 seats  constituencies corresponding to the country s 26 states and the Federal District.
One-third of the senators  27 seats  are elected after a four-year period, and two-thirds  54 seats  are elected after the next four-year period.
When two-thirds of the seats are to be renewed, each elector votes for two candidates.
When one-third is to be renewed, each elector votes for one candidate.

SÃO PAULO, Brazil — President Dilma Rousseff won a second term on Sunday, defeating the conservative Aécio Neves in an acrimonious race that inflamed social and economic divisions in an emerging giant humbled by falling commodity prices.
7% of the ballots in, Ms.
4% for Mr.
Neves.
The victory was a testament to the endurance of Ms.
Rousseff’s left-wing Workers’ Party, which came to power in 2003 and engineered a come-from-behind win against difficult odds.
Ms.
Rousseff ran as an incumbent in a country with a stagnant economy and a large population clamoring for change.
Barely a year ago, protests over the poor quality of government services made her seem vulnerable.
But Brazil’s first female president won four more years by nurturing deep support among Brazil’s poor, who have benefited under a major expansion of the welfare system, and with a late surge in female voters.
To do it, the Rousseff campaign painted the two-time governor Mr.
Neves as an uncaring snob who would endanger benefits for the poor.
On stage before a boisterous crowd in Brasilia, Ms.
Rousseff sought a conciliatory tone, promising dialogue with the opposition after a contentious election.
My first words are to call for peace and unity,” she said, flanked onstage by political allies.
In a country where nearly half the voters cast ballots for change, Ms.
Rousseff promised to restore growth, crack down on corruption and hold a national vote on overhauling the political system, which has been increasingly criticized as producing legislators unresponsive to constituents.
Ms.
S.
S.
President Barack Obama visited Brazil in 2011 to try to improve ties.
The effort crumbled last year when Ms.
Rousseff canceled a White House visit following revelations that the National Security Agency had spied on her and other heads of state.
The election also revived questions about the depth of corruption in Brazil, long seen as an obstacle to development.
A Federal Police investigation into allegations of widespread embezzlement by Rousseff allies at the state oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA became a feature of campaign debates.
Shares of the firm have fallen by more than half since Ms.
Rousseff took office.
The election returns the 66-year-old Marxist rebel-turned-economist to power at a precarious moment for the resource-rich nation.
With commodity prices falling, economists’ pessimism has surged.
They are worried that four more years of her administration’s policies, including subsidizing gasoline prices, capping electricity rates and boosting government spending to juice the economy, may deepen Brazil’s downturn.
75%.
With its debt load rising, economists are now speculating whether the country is on track to lose its coveted investment grade rating.

Brazilian voters went to the polls on Sunday, October 5, 2014 to choose a       President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, as well as members of the       country s bicameral legislature, the National Congress.
However, no candidate       attained an absolute majority in the presidential election, and therefore       a runoff vote was held on Sunday, October 26, 2014.
The election statistics presented in this space come from data issued by       the Higher Electoral Court , which has 2014 election       results in Portuguese.
The 1988 constitution stipulates that the Federative Republic of Brazil is       a legal democratic state, in which all power emanates from the people, who       exercise it by means of elected representatives or directly.
Both the federal       government and the governments of Brazil s 26 states consist of executive,       legislative and judicial branches; likewise, the Federal District, where       the capital city of Brasilia is located, has its own government and legislature.
Executive power is exercised by the President of the Republic, directly elected       by universal suffrage for a term of four years.
The president, who may be       re-elected for only one subsequent term, is chosen by an absolute majority       of votes, not counting blank or void votes.
If no candidate attains an absolute       majority in the first round of voting, a second round is held between the       two candidates with the largest number of votes, and the candidate that obtains       a majority of valid votes is deemed elected.
Legislative power is exercised by the National Congress, which consists of       the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate.
The Chamber of Deputies is composed of 513 members directly elected for a       four-year term of office by proportional representation in each state and       the Federal District.
Chamber seats are distributed among the federal units       in proportion to population, but no unit may have fewer than eight or more       than seventy seats.
Each federal unit is an electoral constituency, in which       political parties and coalitions of two or more parties submit lists of       candidates; voters may choose one candidate and one party.
Chamber of Deputies seats are distributed in each constituency according       to an electoral quotient, obtained by dividing the total number of valid       votes by the number of constituency seats.
Then, the number of votes each       party or coalition has obtained is divided by the electoral quotient.
The       result of this division, disregarding fractions, is the party quotient, and       each party or coalition elects as many deputies as its party quotient indicates;       if there remain unallocated seats after the application of party quotients,       these are distributed according to the largest average method.
Within each       party, mandates are assigned to list candidates with the largest number of       votes until all seats are filled.
The Federal Senate s 81 members are directly elected for an eight-year term       of office.
Senate elections are held every four years, alternating between       one-third  27  and two-thirds  54  of the seats.
Each state and the Federal       District chooses three senators by the plurality or first-past-the-post method,       under which the candidates obtaining the largest number of votes are elected       to office.
Electoral enrollment and voting are mandatory for persons over the age of       eighteen; nonetheless, both are optional for the illiterate and those older       than seventy, as well as for those older than sixteen and under eighteen.
Brazil has developed a highly fragmented political party system since the       transition to democracy in 1985, following more than two decades of military       rule.
Since 1990, there have been no fewer than eighteen parties represented       in the Chamber of Deputies, and none of these has attained even a quarter       of the seats on that legislative body.
Nevertheless, four major parties stand       out: the Workers  Party  PT , the Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB ,       the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMDB  and the Democrats  DEM ,       previously the Liberal Front Party  PFL .
Regarding ideological stance, the       PT is considered a left-wing party and the PSDB a center to center-left party,       while the PMDB is centrist and the PFL is positioned to the right-of-center.
Brazil s transition process to democracy began during the last years of military       rule.
In 1979, the artificial two-party system imposed by the military in       1965 was dissolved, and new political parties were allowed to form.
The       conservative Democratic Social Party  PDS  emerged as a successor of the governmental National Renewal Alliance  ARENA , while the opposition Brazilian       Democratic Movement reconstituted itself as the PMDB.
Two groups sought to       re-establish the Brazilian Labour Party  PTB  of the late president Getúlio       Vargas, who ruled Brazil as a dictator from 1930 to 1945, and as a democratically       elected president from 1951 until 1954, when he committed suicide.
The       authorities ruled that the group headed by Ivete Vargas  a relative of       Getúlio  had the right to use the old party s name and initials; the       group led by Leonel Brizola then founded the left-wing Democratic Labour       Party  PDT .
These four parties, along with the Workers  Party  PT , headed       by union leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, took part in the 1982 election       - Brazil s first free election in two decades.
In the legislative vote, the       PDS won the largest number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies but failed       to attain an absolute majority, while in the gubernatorial elections the       opposition captured the country s three major states: São Paulo and       Minas Gerais elected PMDB governors, and Rio de Janeiro chose the PDT s Leonel       Brizola.
The military government had planned a controlled transition to democracy       through the indirect election of a civilian president in a PDS-dominated       electoral college, and the ruling party went on to choose Paulo Maluf as       its presidential candidate.
Maluf, a former governor of São Paulo,       was  and remains  an extremely controversial figure in Brazil, linked to       numerous corruption scandals over the course of his political career.
In       fact, such is his reputation that Brazilian Portuguese has acquired a verb       derived from his last name: malufar, which means to steal from the       public coffers.
The opposition parties, along with a group of PDS dissidents called the Liberal       Front  FL , agitated in favor of holding direct presidential elections: they       failed to attain this objective, but the breakaway Liberal Front deprived       the PDS of its electoral college majority, and PMDB candidate Tancredo Neves       was elected President, supported by the opposition parties and the FL.
However,       Neves - who had been governor of Minas Gerais since 1982, and prime minister       of Brazil from 1961 to 1962, during a short-lived period of parliamentary       government - fell gravely ill shortly before taking office and died after       repeated surgery; José Sarney, vice-president elect and a PDS dissident,       took over the presidency.
The implementation of a seemingly successful price control package - the Cruzado Plan - allowed the coalition government of the PMDB and the       Liberal Front Party  PFL  to score a sweeping victory in the 1986 legislative       and gubernatorial elections: the PMDB won an absolute majority in the Chamber       of Deputies, as well as all but one of the gubernatorial races; the PFL took       the remaining one, and came in second place in the Chamber.
The PDS faltered,       while the left-wing parties  PDT and PT  registered modest gains.
Following       the legalization of all political parties, the number of parties represented       in the Chamber of Deputies increased to twelve.
The newly elected National       Congress became a Constituent Assembly the following year, and set out to       draft a new constitution to replace the authoritarian instruments of government       inherited from the military regime.
Meanwhile, the Cruzado Plan collapsed       shortly after the 1986 election, and once again inflation spiraled out of       control; eventually, the PMDB-PFL coalition broke apart.
In 1988, Brazil promulgated the new constitution, its eighth in history.
This lengthy document, which originally had a total of 245 articles, retained       the presidential form of government but limited the powers of the presidency,       which could no longer rule by decree.
That same year, the Party of Brazilian       Social Democracy  PSDB  split off the PMDB.
A total of twenty-one candidates ran in the 1989 presidential election, the       first held by popular vote since 1960.
In the first round, Fernando Collor       de Mello, candidate of the small, center-right National Reconstruction Party        PRN , came out of nowhere to finish in first place  but without an absolute       majority , followed by the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  PT ; Leonel       Brizola  PDT  finished third, narrowly behind Lula.
Mário Covas of       the PSDB achieved a respectable fourth place, ahead of Paulo Maluf  PDS ,       while the PMDB and PFL presidential candidates fared disastrously.
In the       runoff vote, Collor prevailed over Lula, becoming Brazil s youngest president.
However, Collor s presidency turned out to be an unmitigated disaster.
During       the nearly three years he held office, Collor was unable to effectively confront       the profound economic crisis he inherited from his predecessor, nor was he       able to muster congressional support for his proposals to cure the country s       ills.
Eventually, Collor appeared to be involved in a multi-million dollar       corruption and influence-peddling scandal, which led Congress to initiate       an impeachment trial against him.
In late 1992, Collor resigned from office,       shortly after the Senate had begun the impeachment trial.
Collor s       vice-president, Itamar Franco, held the presidency for the remainder of his       unfinished mandate.
In 1993, President Franco named well-known sociologist  and then-Minister       of Foreign Affairs  Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Minister of Finance.
Cardoso       introduced the Real Plan, which stabilized the country s finances and brought       hyperinflation to an end.
In the 1994 presidential election, Cardoso ran       as the candidate of his party, the PSDB.
The success of the Real Plan allowed       Cardoso  who was also supported by the PFL and the PTB  to prevail by a wide       margin over the PT s Lula da Silva and six other candidates, attaining an       absolute majority in the first round of voting.
In the 1998 presidential       election, Cardoso - who had successfully persuaded Congress to amend the       constitution and allow presidential re-election for a single term - was       re-elected on the first round by an absolute majority, with Lula in second       place once again.
In the 2002 presidential election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ran for       the fourth straight time as the PT candidate, but his campaign now emphasized        change without rupture.  This pragmatic approach proved to be successful:       in the first round of voting, Lula outpolled his closest adversary, the PSDB s       José Serra, by a two-to-one margin, but fell short of an absolute       majority; in the runoff election, Lula da Silva won the presidency by the       largest vote margin ever recorded in the history of Brazil.
At the same time,       the PT secured the largest number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
President Lula da Silva s government successfully continued the economic       policies initiated by Cardoso, while establishing a number of social programs       to combat poverty, most notably among them the Bolsa Família or Family Stipend, which benefits twelve million Brazilian families -       approximately a third of the country s population.
However, a number of       corruption scandals seriously tarnished the Workers  Party reputation.
The       most damaging of these was the 2005 mensalão or monthly allowance       scandal, which implicated a number of high-ranking party officials.
Nonetheless,       Lula was not directly linked to the aforementioned scandals, and he prevailed       decisively over the PSDB s Geraldo Alckmin in the 2006 presidential election,       albeit PT lost ground in the legislative contests and finished second - behind       PMDB - in the Chamber of Deputies.
Last update: October 26, 2014.
Who should lead Brazil, Dilma Rousseff or Marina Silva?
Which of the two frontrunners in the October 5 presidential elections will do what it takes to turn Brazil around and pull one of the most important economies of the emerging market world from the slump it’s been in over the past few years?
For investors who have been down on Brazil in the tenure of current president Rousseff, the pendulum seems to be swinging in favor of Silva, a former environment minister who came into the limelight in August after presidential hopeful Eduardo Campos and environmental party candidate died in a plane crash.
Silva has outlined a market-friendly plan that both businesses on the ground in Brazil as well as foreign investors believe will spur productivity and encourage investment, both of which seriously tailed off under Rousseff.
Rousseff has overseen a period of the weakest economic growth under any Brazilian president since the early 1990s,” said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London.
Although Brazil has been impacted to a large extent by the global slowdown, in particular in the commodities space, several policies undertaken by the Rousseff administration have also contributed largely to its economic woes, Shearing said.
Inflation has risen and the public sector budget deficit has grown.
Certain policy decisions have negatively impacted industries like utilities and though Rousseff had hinted at helping the ailing Petrobras  Brazil’s state-owned oil company , which is losing a lot of money from importing refined products, that did not come through, and the overall uncertain environment has held back investment spending in Brazil, both domestically as well as from overseas.
Our reading is pretty grim, whichever way you look at it,” Shearing said.
Brazil needs a holistic overhaul, Shearing said, an intense program of structural reforms that would address a range of issues and kickstart economic growth.
Whether Silva is capable of that remains to be seen and for now, the race is extremely tight, meaning that the election will in all likelihood go into a second round on October 26th.
Nick Cowley, Portfolio Manager, Henderson Global Investors:  “If Rousseff wins, we believe that the market is anticipating more of the same.
Some believe she will be slightly more conciliatory toward the business community and  perhaps push through a price mechanism for Petrobras.
There’s also a hope she may be more realistic with respect to infrastructure programs in terms of the returns that investors can get on projects, since Brazil badly needs infrastructure and in her first term, the interest rates were just not attractive enough for most investors.
It is hard to imagine things can be materially worse if Rousseff gets a second term, but nevertheless, government finances are still under pressure, even if the Brazilian economy will continue to muddle through as it has been.
In terms of Silva, no one really knows what she will deliver.
She has talked encouragingly about pushing through reforms but what we as investors are struggling to see right now is how strong a position she will have if she wins, as Brazilian politics are very fragmented.
There are more than 20 political parties and whoever wins this election will have to form coalitions, which means that getting things done will not be easy.
The market, of course, has been rallying ahead of elections in anticipation of a Silva victory and many have compared her to India’s Narendra Modi, who had a very strong mandate when he was elected.
However, whether Silva is the kind of leader who can push things through the way Modi is able to remains to be seen.
Angela Bouzanis, Country Expert, Brazil, FOCUSECONOMICS: “Rousseff has signaled that she won’t drastically alter economic policy if reelected.
She argues that the waning economy is due to external pressures and cites Brazil’s low unemployment rate as a reason to continue with current policies.
However, she has hinted at possible new government appointments and similar small changes.
Silva has vowed to reform Brazil’s political establishment and overhaul economic policy.
Silva has advocated for decreased government spending, creating an independent Central Bank and reforming the Bank’s currency intervention scheme, which has distorted the price of the real.
This change in policies could potentially improve investor sentiment and provide the economy with a more solid economic foundation going forward.
However, whether the winner will make a marked impact on the economy is hard to tell.
If Rousseff follows her campaign promises, then only small changes to her current policy should be expected with no large scale-economic reforms.
Rousseff departed from  Luis Inacio Lula da Silva’s economic policy by trying to stimulate the economy through tax breaks and attempting to control inflation through currency along with fuel and energy prices in addition to traditional monetary policy.
Nevertheless, Rousseff has proven that she can rule Brazil effectively and push legislation through Congress.
Although Silva has promised to adopt more orthodox economic policies and address of some the underlying structural problems in the economy, critics point out that some contradictions exist between her pledge for fiscal austerity and her personal ideologies.
Silva has stated that she will increase public healthcare spending to 10% of GDP.
Further, she has a pro-environment stance, which raises questions on how she would handle the oil and automobile sectors.

Dilma focussed on her government s record of poverty reduction and investing in social programs.
Brazil’s third televised presidential debate was held Tuesday night, as the candidates seek to win over voters ahead of the October 5 general election.
Eight candidates took part but Dilma Rousseff, Marina Silva and Aecio Neves were in the spotlight, as the three candidates leading the polls.
Current president, and Workers Party  PT  candidate, Dilma Rousseff is ahead in the polls but the race is likely to go to a second round.
The main issues debated were health, poverty, corruption, political reform and economic policies.
Marina Silva, Rousseff s main rival, said on several occasions that her government would be made up of “the best people” from all parties.
Regarding health proposals, Rousseff said her government would hire more specialized healthcare workers to shorten lines in hospitals and provide a better health service.
Silva focused on basic sanitary measures, such as improving the water sanitation and improving water supplies.
Silva said she would free up resources  through our country returning to efficiency in public spending,  a message she has pushed throughout the campaign.
This is widely seen as an attempt to win over market investors opposed to the greater role played by Brazil s government in the nation’s economy.
Silva was forced to recognize the successful social programs implemented by the PT governments – two presidential terms under President Lula Da Silva and the current Rousseff administration – saying she would maintain many of its landmark policies.
Critics have pointed out that this would be difficult given her remarks on public spending.
Third place candidate Aecio Neves sought to question Rousseff s response to a corruption scandal discovered in state-owned oil giant Petrobras.
However Dilma emphasised her zero tolerance of corruption and highlighted the role played, under her leadership, in the ongoing investigations by the Federal Police, the Judicial Ministry and the Public Ministry.
At the same time, candidate Luciana Genro from the Socialism and Liberty Party  PSOL  questioned Neves over his own corruption charges, as he allegedly built an airport near his family s land while governor of Minas Gerais state.
With the debate organized by the National Confederation of Priests  CNBB , religious issues played a more prominent role.
Catholic clergymen asked the first round of questions.
Silva converted to evangelical christianity in the 1990s, whilst Rousseff was baptized in the Catholic church but says she no longer attends.
Silva has sought to play on her evangelical credentials to appeal to Brazil’s fastest growing religious group.
This saw her recently backpedal over a previous commitment to gay marriage.

Brazil’s humiliating exit from contention in the World Cup at the hands of Germany, and its failure even to take the consolation prize of third place on Saturday, has understandably left Brazilians feeling crushed.
Some have gone as far as to describe the host’s defeat as a national tragedy.
This is hardly surprising considering the importance of soccer to the nation’s identity.
Young boys in Brazil idolize the all-time greats, from Pele to Neymar, whose humble beginnings have inspired a narrative of soccer as an equalizer, a path out of poverty, and an escape from the favelas and the drugs and violence that plague them.
The question now is whether the aftershocks of Brazil’s soccer exit will continue to be felt this October, when the country takes to the polls to elect its president.
But that enthusiasm faded as the tournament drew nearer – especially as the price tag soared.
These concerns developed in the greater context of the political protests that have wracked Brazil since last summer, with protesters largely demanding that the government take meaningful steps to address poverty and inequality in the country – among the most unequal in the Americas.
And with these grievances in mind, Brazilians found the exorbitant price of the World Cup increasingly difficult to stomach, particularly given concerns that the construction projects and security improvements would not even be ready in time for the start of the tournament.
True, once the World Cup began, soccer took center stage and the country was engulfed by a celebratory and competitive atmosphere as Brazilians appeared to once again embrace the tournament.
The stadiums were pristine.
Security ran smoothly.
All, it seemed, was well – and no one was happier with the success than President Dilma Rousseff.
The defeat  and Brazilians’ deeply emotional reaction  fueled speculation over the likely impact on Brazil’s presidential elections this fall.
And, with the prospect of a Brazilian victory off the table, many feared that the pre-tournament protests would be reignited.
They’ve remained low-key so far, but many still expect Dilma’s popularity, which had been bolstered by the early success of the Brazilian team, to tumble.
Of course, a reality that is easy to forget when the country is caught up in the excitement of the World Cup is that Brazil is much bigger than soccer.
And Dilma almost certainly had much more to gain from a national team victory than she had to lose from their defeat.
If anything, history shows that the national team’s performance has little impact on electoral outcomes.
In 1998, when Brazil lost to France in the finals, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was reelected in the first round; when they won their fifth title in 2002, Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva, then in opposition, was elected to his first term.
But the political undercurrents to this particular World Cup are unprecedented, and will have been compounded by the ignominy of seeing Dilma hand the World Cup trophy to German captain Philipp Lahm rather than Thiago Silva.
Many Brazilians feel they have a common rallying point, one that transcends even soccer.
All this suggests that the apparent perfect storm of grievances, discontent and now defeat mean the odds may not now favor the incumbent, and the obscene chants that echoed around the stadium during the Germany defeat could have been an uncomfortable glimpse of what is to come.
True, new polling has yet to be completed since Brazil’s defeat, and Dilma remains the favorite in the fall’s elections.
But her 4 percentage-point bump when the World Cup began is by no means set in stone – and the 38 percent she garnered in the latest electoral poll is far from enough to guarantee a first-round victory this fall.
As the past month has demonstrated, even favorites can find themselves on the wrong end of history.
PLAYERS PLAY  THE GAME.
BUT AS SOON AS WE USE THE GAME TO FURTHER OUR POLITICS, WE HAVE TO SUFFER WITH THE PROGRESS OR REGRESS OF IT.
Quite true, but it s important to consider that Brazilians are no longer thinking about the World Cup.
As it s said in the article, the country itself is much bigger than soccer – something that is clearer than ever to Brazilians.
The fact the Cup turned up well dispite so much bad expectation may be the determinant factor, and I think Dilma will take advantage of that.
The problem is not Dilma but the opposition, which is poor of ideas and projects.
So, maybe Dilma again.
50% of the workers in brazil gets paid poor wages and gets exploited with long working hours but long lifle populism?
Peolple will remember the spent money with stadium, rather than using for improve health and education systems.
I m really rooting for Brazil, I want them to do well economically.
However, I was really disappointed with Brazilian soccer fans the way they booed their President.
She came to support her national team and the fans booed her.
I thought it was shameful.
Comparing Brazil to Germany, one sees the contrasts.
Brazil is a country governed more by emotion and life-styles.
Germans in general are rational.
They are indoctrinated to work hard and not to live beyond their means.

Brazilian currency and stocks have been hammered in the last few weeks as leftist President Dilma Rousseff gets more likely to be re-elected this month.
But markets could be overreacting.
The Brazilian President and presidential candidate for the Workers’ Party  PT  Dilma Rousseff waves during a campaign rally in Sao Paulo Brazil on September 29, 2014.
The Brazilian general elections will take place next October 5.
Critics say the Rousseff administration has intervened too much in the economy and overspent taxpayer money, resulting in a nasty combination of slow growth and resilient inflation.
At least one large credit-rating firm, Standard & Poor’s, downgraded Brazil earlier this year, while Moody’s is threatening to do the same late next year if things don’t improve.
Brazil still has investment-grade ratings with both agencies.
The government is also criticized for pushing away large sectors of the business community.
In the past few months, electoral polls paved the way for markets to express their displeasure.
As Ms.
33% decline.
25 reais per dollar.
Markets went the opposite direction the month before, when Ms.
Rousseff’s opponent Marina Silva, who pledged to market friendly policies, was leading the polls.
But markets may have been overly pessimistic, as even a second Rousseff administration may be forced to change course, according to some observers.
I think that…given Brazil’s precarious grade rating, whether it is Ms.
Rousseff or Ms.
Silva we will see constructive action” in economic policy, said RBC Global Asset Management Chief Economist Eric Lascelles.
A third candidate, Aécio Neves, has also endeared himself to the markets, but his chances of winning the election are smaller.
25% early last year.
5%.
A sudden change in rules governing Brazil’s electricity industry in 2012, for instance, caused large losses for distributors and could be partially to blame for this year’s steep increases in power bills, critics says.
Over the past three years the president has been slowly creating a crisis of confidence in the government’s economic management, which is acting to stymie investments in the private sector,” Christopher Garman, a head of research at Eurasia research firm wrote in a Thursday report.
Even within the administration there are signs that change in a possible second term is in the cards.
A government official said Friday that, if re-elected, the president is likely to make attempts to appease the business community.
I think it was a mistake not to make sure that business leaders were on board” when prominent economic-policy decisions were made, the official said.
The official, who is not directly involved in economic-policy making, said that some degree of change is likely.
Ms.
Rousseff has already said that Finance Minister Guido Mantega won’t remain in a possible second term, for personal reasons.
Mr.
Mantega had conducted Brazil’s economy since 2006.
Among the changes that are likely to happen regardless of who is elected is an uptick in regulated prices such as fuel and mass-transport fares, some analysts say.

Speaking as a South African and BRICS neighbour, if the Brazilians are unsatisfied with their current leader, then they should rally to nip it in the bud as quickly as possible before the economy falls into a downward spiral like South Africa.
Our current political party started out excellent in 1994 but as the leaders changed and the poor were too uneducated to risk a change of leadership, the leading party became complacent and stopped bothering to work for their place.
If Rousseff is actually working for her place then it is already admirable from my point of view.

Voting in Brazil is mandatory and elections have to be supervised by assistants in each polling station.
In this article, we will learn more about election assistants in Brazil.
Each Tribunal Regional Eleitoral  TRE , Portuguese for Regional Electoral Court, is responsible for summoning all people who will assist in the elections in their designated region.
000 people were summoned to assist in the elections.
Justifications for not being able to carry out the role of election assistant must be presented to the judge of their Electoral Zone within five days of receiving the summons.
This must include a document proving the individual will be unable to assist in the elections.
Despite this, there is no guarantee that the person will be dismissed from assisting in the elections.
Absence from regular work due to assisting in the elections or training for them cannot be considered absence at work and can not be denied by employers.
If a worker does not receive the paid leave from their employer, the worker is allowed to claim their rights in a Labor Court or report the occurrence to their syndicate or at the nearest Delegacia Regional do Trabalho, which is Portuguese for Regional Labor Police Station.
All people owning a Voter Registration Card , older than 18 years old and having no legal issues related to the Electoral Justice are eligible to be summoned or can volunteer themselves to be an election assistant.
Those who fulfill the requirements - mentioned above - to be an election assistant but were not summoned can voluntarily apply for it, through the Mesário Voluntário program.
To voluntarily apply to be an election assistant, the individual must contact the nearest TRE office to know if the program has been implemented.
If not, the interested individual must contact the nearest Cartório Eleitoral, Portuguese for Electoral Notary Office, and present themselves as available to work as an electoral assistant.
The responsibilities of all election assistants are described in the Electoral Law.
Paid leave equal to double the days spent in training activities for the elections or in the elections.

Brazil’s national elections next weekend.
They follow ex-footballer Romario, an outspoken critic of this year’s World Cup, and the clown Tiririca, who both triumphed in the vote in 2010 and are standing again.
Favoured by parties for their instant appeal, celebrities are often popular with the public, since they are viewed as being independent of the corruption endemic in politics.
The plastic surgeon known as “Dr Hollywood”, Roberto Rey, who is running in São Paulo as a federal deputy for the Social Christian Party, has already been a TV star in the US as well as Brazil.
Also in São Paulo, the astronaut Marcos Pontes will be counting on patriotic feeling to win him votes on 5 October.
As the campaign trail heats up, many have turned to extremes to get themselves noticed.
One of the more eccentric is Toninho do Diabo, or Little Tony the Devil, a circus performer who dresses as Satan and promises to send corrupt politicians to hell.
And after a legal ruling, Rio de Janeiro’s candidate Claudio Henrique dos Anjos will be allowed to go to the polls with the name Barack Obama.
Brazil’s open list proportional representation system means that votes for anyone with a high profile can be used to get other candidates in for the same party.
This means they are more than just a novelty.
Political scientist and professor at the University of Brasilia, David Fleischer, said popular or notorious public figures have found a home in Brazilian politics for many years, in part due to this system.
This was even true during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.
The military leaders always courted Pelé, who would have been hugely popular with the public, but he sensibly said no,” Professor Fleischer said.
Proportional representation also helps evangelical Christian bishops and pastors who will always get their faithful to vote for them.
Protestant worshippers, often pentecostal or evangelical, now make up 23 per cent of the population and religious figures with an ultra-conservative agenda are increasingly influential.
A survey by newspaper O Globo showed a 44 per cent increase in the number of candidates this year with the title pastor.
As well as religion, some candidates use the nightly “political hour” on television to emphasise personal characteristics, such as the football team they support.
3 million votes.
It was viewed as a protest vote, but while celebrity candidates traditionally last only one term after being elected, Tiririca is now up for re-election.
While Professor Fleischer points out that while he has put in the hours with a 100 per cent attendance record in the local legislature, the clown is yet to present a single bill.
Perhaps his main legacy will be that five other clown candidates have now presented themselves for next week’s election.
Romario has won credibility with his outbursts against Fifa and Sepp Blatter during the World Cup.
He too is likely to serve another term.
Corruption is high on the agenda for Brazil’s electorate.
State-run oil company Petrobras is currently at the centre of allegations that politicians took kickbacks.
And the Mensalao corruption trial is still fresh in people’s minds.
The vote-buying scheme tainted the former president Lula Inacio da Silva’s time in office, even though there were no charges brought against him.
Both scandals implicate the ruling Workers’ Party and could complicate the re-election prospects of the incumbent president, Dilma Rousseff.
Homebase has announced the closure of one in four of its stores.
BRASILIA, Oct.
4  Xinhua  -- Brazilians will go to the polls Sunday in general elections to elect a new president, as well as state governors, and national and state legislators.
8 million people are expected at the polls.
According to Brazil s Superior Electoral Court, voters between the ages of 45 and 59 predominate in this year s elections.
There are three main candidates, including incumbent President Dilma Rousseff, who is running for re-election.
According to electoral law, a presidential or gubernatorial candidate must garner more than 50 percent of the vote to win, otherwise the top two candidates from the first round will face a run-off on Oct.
26.
Some 30,000 troops will be deployed to 250 cities across Brazil to ensure smooth voting and to provide logistical assistance, including transporting ballot boxes and election officials in remote areas, the Defense Ministry said.
A Central Command and Control Center, initially established to guarantee security during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, will be used during the elections, the ministry said.
Brazil s electronic voting system is generally admired for its accuracy, efficiency and speed, the electoral body said.
7 percent of the electorate .
For the 2018 general elections, all eligible voters are expected to be covered by the system.
Exchange traded funds tracking Brazilian equities tumbled as the left-leaning incumbent President Dilma Rousseff s prospects brightened.
That disappointed investors looking for a win for her rival, the environmentalist Marina Silva.
J.
Schenkelberg, senior portfolio manager for CLS Investments, which manages $6 billion in assets.
But Silva s win could create greater short-term volatility due to the risk of rising inflation tied to her free-market policies, she added.
Rousseff has regained a slight edge in the race after weeks of aggressive campaigning against Silva, Reuters reported Tuesday.
Brazil ETFs also lost momentum on news that Silva has only a narrow lead over Rousseff in a likely second-round runoff on Oct.
26 that is expected to decide the election.
2 billion iShares MSCI Brazil Capped  ARCA: EWZ  , the largest in the space, tumbled 6% in the past week and 11% in the past 30 days.
2 billion weighted in Brazilian companies, fell 6% and 8% in the same periods.
Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap  ARCA: BRF   lost 6% and 10%.
56.
It hit that price on Sept.
3 as investors optimistic of a Silva win crowded in.
Analysts at BlackRock, which runs iShares ETFs, point out that Brazilian stocks rallied earlier in 2014 due to positive pre-election sentiment.
EWZ has been gathering assets at a rapid pace in the run-up to the election, the analysts added in a statement to IBD.
Curiously, month to date, EWZ, ILF and BRF have seen net cash inflow of $576 million, $31 million and $5 million, respectively.
Given the negative returns, that could mean investors are seeking to short the ETFs, possibly requiring creation of additional shares, Schenkelberg says.
Investors also are using the highly liquid EWZ as a tactical play  for expressing long, short and options trade views around the potential outcome  of the election, according to BlackRock.
EWZ trades about 17 million shares on average a day.
As political uncertainty looms, EWZ and ILF are trading below their 50-day moving average line.
BRF is well below the 200-day moving average, a bearish sign.
Further depressing Brazilian stocks: a potential default by neighboring Argentina, Brazil s third largest trading partner.
Schenkelberg said.
Still, her outlook on Brazilian funds is bullish.
GDP growth, a growing middle class and improved infrastructure after the recent soccer World Cup.
She purchased ILF less than two weeks ago for one of the funds she manages.
In addition to 57% exposure to Brazil, it allocates 27% of assets to Mexico, whose prospects she also likes.

Brazilians vote today in the most unpredictable presidential election in decades and the first since the end of an economic boom underpinning the leftist Workers’ Party’s 12-year rule.
As president Dilma Rousseff seeks a second term, voters are weighing whether the socioeconomic gains of the last decade are enough to reject the candidacies of a popular environmentalist and a pro-business social democrat, who both promise to jumpstart the economy after four years of lackluster growth.
Polls now show Ms Rousseff as the front runner in a race that is likely to go to a runoff on October 26th, following one of the most competitive campaigns since Brazil returned to democracy in 1985.
The death of one candidate, the unexpected surge of another, and bitter marketing by Ms Rousseff to claw back into the lead have contributed to a nail-biter election as uncertain as the course of the country itself.
It really is too close to call,” said Rafael Cortez , a political analyst with Tendencias, a consultancy in Sao Paulo.
The daylong vote will unfold at 450,000 polling stations across the country of 200 million people, from the densely populated metropolitan areas of the southeast to remote Amazon villages.
Voters will also elect governors, members of Congress and state legislators.
More than 140 million people are registered to vote in Brazil, where everyone between the ages of 18 and 70 is required to cast a ballot.
The voting is fully computerised, meaning results are expected just a few hours after polls close in western states.
Ms Rousseff’s main rivals are Marina Silva , a hero of the global conservation movement and ruling party defector now with the Brazilian Socialist Party , and Aecio Neves, a senator and former state governor from the centrist party that laid the groundwork for Brazil’s economic boom last decade.
The two opposition candidates, in a last-minute sprint for runner-up, both vow to return to the market-friendly economic policies that critics say Ms Rousseff abandoned, especially strict budget and inflation targets.
They also promise to stop meddling with the big, state-run banks and companies that have been subject to political intervention and corruption scandals in recent years.
It’s shameful what has happened to our public companies,” Mr Neves complained during the final televised debate among the candidates, citing a multi-million dollar kickback scandal now surrounding state-run energy company Petrobras .
After trailing Ms Silva for most of the campaign, Mr Neves may have built up enough momentum to advance to a runoff against Ms Rousseff.
Three polls yesterdayshowed Mr Neves slightly ahead of Ms Silva.
Ms Rousseff can count on a bedrock of support among the working class, thanks to generous social welfare programs that grew in scope during the two terms of her hugely popular predecessor and political godfather, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
I will vote for Dilma,” said Cesar Rogerio , a postman making deliveries Saturday in Rio de Janeiro, citing the uncertainty many working-class voters feel about the direction her rivals might take.

Brazilian presidential candidate Aecio Neves has also been backed by supermodel Naomi Campbell.
With the clock ticking in Brazil’s tight presidential election, celebrities from sports stars to supermodels are offering endorsements in last-ditch efforts to get their candidates over the line.
Three days before the vote, the country’s most popular soccer star Neymar released a video telling Brazilians he favors Senator Aecio Neves, the opponent of incumbent Dilma Rousseff.
Neves has also been backed by supermodel Naomi Campbell, while ’Lethal Weapon’ actor Danny Glover announced support for Rousseff, even though neither has the right to vote.
Singer Chico Buarque, among the country’s best-known musicians, recorded an ad showing his support for another Rousseff term.
I will support candidate Aecio Neves because I identify myself a lot with his proposal for Brazil,” Neymar said in a Youtube broadcast that resembled the tear-stained address he made to the nation when he had to exit the World Cup with a back injury.
Rousseff has taken the lead over Neves in polls for the first time since the first-round vote, according to two opinion surveys published yesterday.
Her support was 48 percent compared with 42 percent for Neves in an Oct.
22-23 Datafolha poll and 49 percent against 41 percent for Neves in an Ibope poll.
Both surveys, which previously showed the candidates statistically tied, have a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.
When a race is as tight as this one is seen to be, these late supports may have some effect,” said David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the University of Brasilia.
4 percent for Rousseff.
2 percentage points.
Sensus also conducts surveys for Neves’s campaign.
Neymar, who plays soccer in Spain with Barcelona, is Brazil’s most-marketed athlete.
He has endorsement deals with several of the world’s biggest companies including Nike Inc.
Banco Santander SA.
Other soccer legends, including former World Cup winners Ronaldo and Bebeto, also back Neves.
Brazilian voters are not very sophisticated so they may look to these people for orientation,” Guilherme Guimaraes, an independent Rio-based sports marketer who has worked for Coca-Cola Co.
The support of a public figure may end up backfiring for the candidate depending on the tone and message used, according to University of Brasilia’s Fleischer.
While Neymar remains the darling of Brazil’s soccer-loving public, other members of the national squad saw their popularity plummet after the team was humiliated 7-1 by eventual winner Germany at World Cup.
Sometimes the endorsement may be counterproductive,” Fleischer said.

President Dilma Rousseff will face challenger Aecio Neves, leader of Brazil s center-right opposition, in a presidential election runoff three weeks after Brazilians voted for the country s two traditional political parties Sunday.
Marina Silva, the environmentalist candidate who had surged to the head of the race after Socialist candidate Eduardo Campos died in an August plane crash, dropped to third place in the final days of the campaign after facing attacks from Neves, a Social Democrat, and Rousseff’s ruling Workers  Party.

With 96% of votes officially counted, Rousseff had received 41% to Neves’ 34% and Silva’s 21%.
Eight other candidates split the remainder.
For me, Aecio Neves just had a better chance of beating Rousseff in the second round, so I voted for him,” said Viviane Grilli, a 30-year-old advertising professional in Sao Paulo, after voting Sunday.
In congressional and gubernatorial elections, Brazilian voters also largely reaffirmed the existing power structure, handing wins to traditionally powerful parties, in a voting day that upended predictions that the country would take the discontent expressed in widespread protests last year to the ballot box.
Marina Silva was the only person who came close to personifying the discontent that fueled the protests, but this is hardball,” said Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, a political analyst at Eurasia Group in Washington.
You need solid party structure across the nation.
The Workers  Party has that, and so do the Social Democrats.
Rousseff s Workers’ Party has been in power for 12 years, since her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva became the first left-of-center presidential candidate to be elected in Brazil s post-dictatorship era.
The decade that followed his 2002 election was marked by an economic boom, the rise of millions out of poverty and Brazil s emergence on the world stage.
But in the last few years of Rousseff s presidency, support for the government lagged as the boom ended, and mass protests last year gave voice to widespread discontent with public services such as healthcare, education and infrastructure.
Rousseff is the favorite to win in the second round, but could face a tough battle with Aecio Neves, the senator and former governor of Minas Gerais state, who is likely to rail against corruption and economic problems.
Neves is the grandson of Tancredo Neves, who was elected president in 1985 but died before taking office.
The incumbent, a former left-wing guerrilla who is Brazil s first female president, is likely to rely on her solid support among Brazil s poor, especially those who have benefited from government social programs, and to remind voters how much better things are than they were 12 years ago.
Both Neves and Rousseff attacked Silva for changing her positions and parties too often, and for not being able to form the solid base needed to govern.
Silva, an evangelical, famously withdrew her party s support for gay marriage after a series of tweets from an influential pastor criticized her position, which led to her being seen as socially conservative or inconsistent.
I was going to vote for Marina Silva, until she switched sides so often and made it clear she wouldn t do anything for us homosexuals,” said Leando Jesus Costa, a 23-year-old telemarketer in Sao Paulo.
Lula did so many things right, from increasing the minimum wage to helping the poor with  Bolsa Familia,” said Gilberto Santos da Silva, a 28-year-old cook in Sao Paulo.

How will the Brazilian presidential election unfold?
Brazilians go to the polls on October 5 in the first round of voting for presidential, congressional, and state elections.
If no presidential candidate secures 50 percent of the vote, a runoff election will be held on October 26.
The upcoming elections are likely to bring major changes at the national level—though incumbent governors are largely poised to claim victory at the state level—that could significantly alter the course of Brazil’s domestic and international policies.
After five presidential election cycles, the see-saw rivalry between the coalition led by the Workers’ Party  PT  and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB  seems to have come to an end.
Following the tragic death of Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB  presidential candidate Eduardo Campos on August 13, his running mate, Marina Silva, now heads the ballot, with a stunning turnaround in voters’ intentions.
Aécio Neves, the PSDB candidate, seems poised to take third place.
In just two weeks, the PSB ticket saw first-round support increase from 9 percent before Eduardo Campos’ death to 34 percent.
As of September 23, IBOPE polls indicate Marina and President Dilma Rousseff  PT  are neck and neck in the second round with 41 percent each.
As former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  PT  summed up, the death of Eduardo Campos ended one election and the entrance of Marina Silva marked the start of a new one.
Dilma wins the second round by a significant margin.
A comfortable victory for Dilma could give increased momentum to her economic policy.
If Dilma wins the election by a significant margin, the political cycle that began with Lula assuming office in 2003 will continue for another four years.
This cycle is based on an alliance between the PT and the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMDB , which controls a substantial part of the Congress, and a range of smaller parties.
But after twelve years, the political alliance is becoming more strained with a loss of coalition cohesion throughout Dilma’s first term.
A sizable victory could allow Rousseff to regain some influence over the legislature.
Still, she would continue to face an uphill battle maintaining a stable majority in Congress.
A comfortable victory for Dilma could give increased momentum to her economic policy.
Rousseff governs with a heterodox macroeconomic policy  in contrast to Lula’s orthodox model  and has increased the level of state intervention in various sectors of the economy.
6 percent in September.
The president’s economic campaign proposals reflect her current policies.
Dilma has implied that she would replace Minister of the Economy Guido Mantega, but there is no indication that she would choose a less heterodox successor.
A broad Dilma victory could well reinforce this economic policy trend.
For example, Dilma’s tendency would be to choose a minister from the current economic team rather than looking at notable figures in the private sector or considering recommendations by Lula da Silva.
Her policies on infrastructure, energy, and oil and gas would also follow current standards, focusing on the business model of state-owned enterprises to govern banks and other important industries.
This model of providing the state with greater control—already in place in key sectors such as airports, oil, and gas—would also be adopted in the railway sector and continue as a fundamental part of Dilma’s government.
Dilma would have little incentive to change Brazil’s foreign policy or even the current minister of foreign affairs.
There are signs that she would seek to reengage in closer relations with the United States after the elections, resuming conversations that were discontinued after disagreements over the National Security Agency’s spying last year.
No big changes would be expected on other foreign policy issues, including those within South America.
Marina secures an overwhelming victory in the second round.
Economically, unlike the PSDB strategy of the last two elections, Marina is not campaigning in direct opposition to PT positions.
Marina could win the election by a large margin if the 19 percent of likely first-round votes for Aécio Neves  PSDB, party of former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso  migrate en masse to her candidacy.
As a recent convert to the PSB—a small party with only 5 percent of the seats in Congress—Marina would find her biggest challenge in constructing a congressional majority.
Though unlikely, a sizable victory would allow her to begin the presidency with the necessary popular backing to push Congress to pass key legislation.
Politically, Marina would seek to shift the president’s relationship with Congress from one that relies on a broad, reasonably cohesive base  the model of the last twenty years  to one that forms majority support based on individual issues.
She contends that the current model leads to cronyism and corruption, and has been more of a pitfall than a solution for working with Congress.
She would have to work with a Congress expected to be even more fragmented than today, where four of the twenty-three political parties represent 50 percent of congressional seats.
Both the number of parties and the degree of fragmentation is expected to grow after the election, making it more difficult to create and maintain stable majorities.
Economically, unlike the PSDB strategy of the last two elections, Marina is not campaigning in direct opposition to PT positions.
She has positioned her candidacy as a “Third Way” among the more leftist and rightist options, with a government that would base its policies on the best solutions from across the political spectrum.
Marina roundly criticizes the government’s macroeconomic policy, high inflation rates, low growth, and its high degree of state intervention in the credit and energy markets.
While Marina’s social policies are similar to those of PT leaders  she did serve as environment minister under Lula , her economic plan approaches that of the Fernando Henrique Cardoso  PSDB  government.
To reinforce her belief in orthodox macroeconomic management, Marina has included a plan to turn the Central Bank into an independent agency.
Marina’s platform on industrial policy follows the basic concepts of the PSB.
That means she would promote policies to foster investment in strategic sectors such as information technology and biotechnology, among others.
Marina has indicated a basic vision for energy policy, though it has not been the main focus of her agenda.
She has committed to providing strong support for renewable energy investments.
As an environmentalist, she has been very critical of new hydropower plant projects in the Amazon region.
This would be a very hot issue in the case of a Marina victory, as she would change several of the policies currently in place.
Marina has given little indication that she would promote substantial changes in Brazil’s foreign policy, with the exception of trade policy.
Marina has said publicly that she would seek trade deals with the United States and the European Union if elected.
Relationships with neighbors in South America favored under the PT administration as well as Brazil, Russia, India, and China  BRIC  engagement may no longer be top priorities.
The winner squeaks out a second-round win by a very slim margin.
Whether it s a Marina or a Dilma victory, Brazil is likely to see a break from the last four years.
This is the most likely scenario.
A small PSB victory could be quite negative for Marina and for the country as it would diminish her political negotiating power.
The scenario of a narrow Dilma victory, however, could bring about some much needed change to the country.
Given that Marina would need great legitimacy and political force to govern with a reduced caucus in Congress, a win by narrow margins could undermine her political latitude and paralyze her government from the beginning.
This scenario would result in Marina’s administration having a profile similar to that of the José Sarney  1985-1990  and Itamar Franco  1992-1995  governments.
In both cases, the inability to build majorities in Congress left the two presidents without political muscle or the ability to attract relevant political leadership to join their governments.
At the end of their terms, both presidents named personal friends or politically insignificant persons to the ministries.
This scenario would reinforce Marina’s motivation to mobilize civil society as compensation for lacking political support in Congress.
The goal would be for civil society to pressure Congress and traditional political parties to adopt Marina’s reforms, including political reform.
In Dilma’s case, the effect of a narrow victory would likely be the opposite.
It would potentially force her to reconfigure government policies or even consider responding to some of the main opposition criticisms, particularly around macroeconomic management.
Lula has argued in favor of Dilma reviewing some of her policies, but so far without much success.
A slim victory scenario could strengthen the push to reform.
The appointment of Nelson Barbosa—a figure close to Lula—as new minister of finance would be a strong signal in this direction.
A narrow Dilma victory would also increase allied parties’ bargaining power, especially for the PMDB.
This would likely result in these allied parties’ increased presence and control of political appointments in ministries and state-owned companies.
Whether it’s a Marina or a Dilma victory under this last scenario, Brazil is likely to see a break from the last four years.

There’s a lot going on in the world these days, so you may not have been paying attention to Brazil.
But the country has an extremely important election coming up this weekend – one that will decide amongst other things, who their president will be for the next four years.
The reason this election is so important is because it is more or less a referendum on the incumbent party, the Partido dos Trablhadores  PT  — the “Worker’s Party,” who has ushered in an unprecedented era of prosperity in Brazil for people across almost all backgrounds.
This is also the first election after massive, nationwide protests  led largely by young upper and lower middle class urban residents , against government spending on mega events like the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympics.
Brazil is also still one the world’s most unequal countries .
Fed up in general with “the establishment,” many Brazilian voters are so disillusioned with politics that in this traditionally left-leaning, post-right military dictatorship society, the right has made surprising gains in this election.
So, what’s going on in Brazil, and what’s at stake in this referendum on the PT?
Well to the first point, in the wake of the protest, young Brazilians haven’t suddenly switched political allegiances to support the right.
Protesters aren’t turning to Neves and his party of the upper classes.
In fact, more people voted null than voted for Neves in the first round of elections.

South American stance that has grown in Brazil and neighboring countries in the past years.
However with Brazil’s economic miracle showing signs of waning , perhaps more importantly, this is a referendum on the state-led social programs that the PT has attempted to implement over the last years.
General wisdom is that the lower classes who benefit from such social programs as Bolsa Familia , programs that have helped reduced poverty during the Lula Rousseff presidencies, are fully  and naively  in support of the PT .
Besides class, there is a definite racial dynamic to this course of thought as well.
Emblematic of this is the comment that a university-educated, engineer-turned-taxista made to me recently — that black people in Brazil don’t know how to vote in their own favor, and that they only vote for the PT because of the Bolsa Familia, a program that is really holding them back.
One of the frequent complaints of some right-leaning voters is that the poor consistently vote for the PT, and that the PT uses programs like the cash-transfer program Bolsa Familia to win those votes.
But Neves’ close second finish in the first round and the election of the most conservative Congress in the post-1964 period indicates that there’s a diversity of support for the right.
Rio blogger Julia Michaels even argues: “Paradoxically, it may be that part of Dilma’s Workers’ Party shrinking appeal is due to a growing conservatism on the part of those who have left poverty during their watch.
However, my favorite quote from Rio Gringa’s article really explains the social and political dynamic of contemporary Brazil, and really most middle-income nations of the global South.
In order to understand this quote it would be useful to turn to popular culture.
S.
Brazil, is emblematic of this phenomenon.
So are Rolezinhos .
But where there is a disconnect in this participation, is that many times the young populations that represent, and are represented by these cultures, are left out of participation in the political life of a country.
A prime example of this in Brazil is the violence carried out by Military Police on favela residents in Rio, and particularly young men of color whom are usually just seen in the public sphere as “thugs” and drug dealers .
In Brazil, a place where in the last few years, the lower classes have fully entered in to the consumerist economy  whether by state engineering or not  — and are existing in an economy that is fully dependent on materialist consumerism — the perceived gains achieved by economic inclusion plans such as Bolsa Familia, are thinner than they perhaps seem.
From what I’ve witnessed over the past months, this is the real concern of the protesters, young people, and the Brazilian Left.

LONDON – You mustn’t expect politicians in a democratic system to come up with ideologically pure, intellectually consistent policies.
Their job is to put together a winning coalition of voters who have different and even conflicting interests, and if that requires compromises and even contradictions, so be it.
But they must appear to be consistent, and Marina Silva has mastered the art.
Until last month Silva was the vice presidential candidate of the smallest of Brazil’s three main parties, a woman with a national reputation as an environmental activist but little prospect of high political office.
President Dilma Rousseff was cruising serenely toward re-election in the first round of the elections on Oct.
5, despite the fact the Brazil’s once-booming economy is in a recession.
And then a small plane crashed.
Silva was supposed to be on that plane, but changed her plans at the last moment.
All seven people who were on board died, including the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB , Eduardo Campos.
With the election campaign already under way, the PSB had no choice but to promote Silva in his place, and suddenly the election became a real race.
A woman as president is no longer an innovation in Brazil.
Rousseff broke through that barrier four years ago.
A dramatic back story — Silva is the daughter of illiterate rubber tappers in the Amazon, and only learned to read when she was 16 — is also not unusual in a Brazilian president: Rousseff was tortured and jailed by the military dictators who ruled Brazil in the 1970s.
But Silva really is different.
She is bright Green: Her own party, which she took into coalition with the PSB, is called the Sustainability Network.
Even more importantly in a country where half the population is nonwhite, Silva is a caboclo, the mixed-race combination of native Indian, black and white that is common in the Amazon.
There has never been a serious presidential contender who was black before.
Only two weeks after Silva was chosen to replace the late Eduardo Campos, she has tripled the PSB’s support in the opinion polls.
There is now almost no chance that Dilma Rousseff will win outright in the first round of the elections.
The polls predict that Silva will come second to Rousseff in that round — and then beat the incumbent by 47 percent to 43 percent of the votes in the runoff three weeks later.
All very well, but what would Silva do as the president of Brazil?
It’s an important question, because Brazil, the world’s fifth-largest country  200 million people , is going through difficult times.
Over the past 12 years the governing Workers’ Party has lifted 40 million Brazilians out of poverty, but economic growth has now stalled.
Many people blame the government’s highly protectionist policies.
Silva is a plain-speaking woman with no allegations of corruption trailing her around  as they do so many other Brazilian politicians , but she has been remarkably unforthcoming on what she would do about the economy.
This is because she now heads a political coalition whose major member, the PSB, is actually “business-friendly,” as they say.
After the brutal reign of the generals in 1964-85, the phrase went out of use, and all three major parties sound as if they are on the left: the Workers’ Party, the Brazilian Socialist Party, and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
But only the Workers’ Party is even moderately socialist; the other two are center-left and center-right.
Silva’s plans for the environment are equally obscure, beyond the well-known fact that she disapproves of giant hydroelectric dams in the Amazon  though she hasn’t canceled any of them .
She still talks like a Green, but her vicepresidential running mate, Beto Albuquerque, was responsible for pushing a law legalizing the use of genetically modified soybeans through Congress.
She is, in other words, a “typical politician” who is trimming her sails to the prevailing wind.
She accepted Albuquerque as a running mate because she needs to appeal to the agribusiness sector, which accounts for almost half of Brazil’s exports and a quarter of the economy.
Indeed, Silva’s economic platform is practically identical to that of the center-right candidate, Aecio Neves: She would end price controls and energy subsidies, strengthen the autonomy of the central banks, and “streamline”  read: cut  the federal budget.
On the other hand, despite her pursuit of business support she is still strong on environmental issues in general and on an end to the deforestation of the Amazon in particular.
This is not consistent, and ideologically pure Brazilian environmentalists are already disappointed in her, but she has nothing to apologize for.
She has put together a set of policies and a coalition of supporters that are inconsistent and sometimes downright contradictory, but they may deliver her into the presidency.
And that’s the point of the exercise: Without power, policies are irrelevant.

Last year s mass protests in Brazil drew attention to health-care spending—an issue that could be in the spotlight again ahead of October s national election.
Michael Kepp reports from Rio de Janeiro.
In June, 2013, more than 1 million Brazilians in cities throughout the country staged mass protests.
Although initially sparked by a rise in public transport costs, the street demonstrations evolved into mass protests against excessive government spending on the World Cup soccer tournament and against insufficient public spending on essential services, in particular, health and education.
The lack of mass protests during this year s World Cup were probably the result of soccer fever having distracted the public and the government having flooded public areas with police and the military.
But upcoming national elections on Oct 5, in which President Dilma Rousseff will run for a second term, could rekindle the debate about government spending on health and education, health experts said.
The mass protests were a public outcry against misplaced government spending priorities and could resume”, said Luís Fernando Correia, who was the head of emergency services at the Hospital Samaritano, a private Rio de Janeiro hospital, for 17 years.
A February, 2014, survey, taken by DataFolha, a private polling agency, supported Correia s contention.
In it, 45% of those surveyed said that “health” was the country s main problem.
Some 45% of those surveyed blamed poor health care on too few doctors and nurses and 23% blamed it on insufficient financial resources.
The federal government s 2014 public health budget was 90 billion reais  US$40·6 billion , a mere 3·5% of the federal budget.
But Brazil s Health Minister Arthur Chioro defended that budget by saying that “federal spending on public health has been steadily increasing on both an annual and a per-capita basis”.
Per-person public health spending increased by 188% in the past decade, according to ministry figures.
Nonetheless, in 2013, civil-sector groups, as part of a public initiative that collected 2 million signatures, entered a bill into Congress that would require the federal government to spend at least 10% of its budget on public health, a threefold increase over the 2014 budget.
The government is supporting a different bill in Congress that would provide, during a 5-year period, a 7% increase in federal spending on public health, said José Noronha, the Health Ministry s former National Secretary for Healthcare and now a senior researcher at the government s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the biggest health research centre in Latin America, located in Rio de Janeiro.
Brazil s 1988 constitution created the Unified Health System  Sistema Único de Saúde or SUS  based on the principle of health as a human right.
As a result, today, 75% of Brazil s 195 million people benefit from public health care, managed and provided by all levels of government—municipal, state, and federal.
The 25% of the public who can afford it or, more commonly, whose companies pay for it, use private health-care plans linked to higher-quality private hospitals.
However, in Brazil, private and public health-care systems overlap, an interface which can be cooperative.
Virtually 100% of all patients with AIDS get free treatment from SUS.
And many cancer patients, not adequately covered by their private plans, also use SUS hospitals that specialise in treating the disease.
Public—private hospital services also overlap.
In Brazil, where 70% of the hospitals  and 69% of all hospital beds  are private and 30% of the hospitals  and 31% of all hospital beds  are public, poorer Brazilians without private health plans who need in-patient treatment in overcrowded, understaffed, and under-equipped public hospitals, often have to wait a long time to get in.
To help public hospitals handle this overflow, private hospitals make 50% of their beds available to SUS patients, so that nearly 66% of all hospital beds in Brazil are available to SUS patients.
But this overlap of public and private hospital services, rather than being cooperative, often creates conflict and controversy.
Because there are too few public hospitals to treat low-income people, private hospitals, which prioritise maximising profit, tend to choose what SUS patients they will take in, based on how much the government will remunerate them for their services, not based on how critical or urgent their medical condition is”, said José Sestelo, a professor of collective health at the Bahia State Federal University.
Public hospital overcrowding is most acute in big cities, where most of Brazil s population is concentrated.
In Rio de Janeiro, the country s second largest city, 15 000 people are waiting for treatment in six federal hospitals and three federal medical institutes  for cardiac and cancer-related operations, and orthopaedic or trauma-related injuries , which do more complex surgeries, alleges Daniel Macedo, a Rio de Janeiro federal public defender.
Some of them have been waiting years for surgery in these federal hospitals and institutes, Macedo said.
In February, Macedo filed a civil lawsuit against the federal, state, and municipal governments of Rio de Janeiro that would, if a court rules in favour of the suit, require these three levels of government to either jointly draft an action plan for treating the patients on the list within 1 year or pay private hospitals to treat them within 1 year.
Many of these 15 000 patients in Rio s federal hospital system need surgeries of low-to-medium complexity, done by municipal and state hospitals, but which refuse to treat them because, once they have already entered the federal hospital system, government rules prevent them from transferring into state or municipal hospitals.
So some patients in the most critical condition or needing care most urgently could die while waiting for it”, Macedo said.
The Family Health Program, created in 1994, when it began treating 1 million people, is Brazil s main delivery system for primary health care.
The programme, now renamed the Family Health Strategy  ESF , had a budget of 3·2 billion reais  $1·45 billion  in 2013, 11% more than in 2010.
Today, 35 305 teams of doctors, nurses, nurse s assistants, dentists and medical technicians in the ESF treat 109 million people, 56% of the population, in all Brazil s 5560 municipalities.
These teams staff 39 900 basic health clinics, mainly in the poor peripheries of cities and in rural regions.
The ESF, which provides free vaccinations and treats the initial stages of many diseases, is the main reason why infant mortality has decreased by 58% since 2000 and why average life expectancy has increased from 70 years in 2000 to 74 years in 2012.
But public health experts say that the ESF is underfunded.
Although the government has spent money to reform, expand, and better equip ESF clinics, it hasn t built enough new ones to keep up with population growth.
Nor has it invested enough in polyclinics, whose wider range of health care and diagnostic services can provide more specialised outpatient care.
This is one reason that public hospitals are so overcrowded”, said Ligia Giovanella, a researcher at the government s National School of Public Health  ENSP , based in Rio de Janeiro.
Another problem of the ESF is that most of its doctors live and prefer to work in big cities, rather than in their poor peripheral satellite cities or in rural areas.
The deficit of SUS doctors, and the high doctor turnover rate of the ESF is one reason that the government, in July, 2013, launched the More Doctors programme to increase the number of ESF physicians in 3785 municipalities, mostly rural areas and poor urban peripheries, and to reform and expand basic health clinics and 24-hour emergency centres where many of them practice.
As part of this programme, the government has, in the past year, spent 11·3 billion reais  $5·1 billion  on such infrastructural upgrades.
There are now 14 462 such physicians taking part in the More Doctors programme in 3785 municipalities, 2302 of them Brazilians and the rest of them foreigners, the vast majority  11 429  of them Cubans, who are here temporarily.
They can work on the programme for 3 years and stay an additional 3 years.
Former National Secretary for Healthcare Noronha agrees.
The More Doctors programme has greatly improved primary health care in the rural and poor urban areas where doctors are in short supply”, he said.
The More Doctors programme foresees the creation of 11 500 new openings in medical schools by 2017, 3363 of which the government has already authorised, as well as more than 12 400 additional residency positions to train medical specialists in 3363 public and private hospitals by 2018.
But whether the promise of more doctors will satisfy the Brazilian public s concerns about health in the country remains to be seen.
Health care could play a big part in how votes are cast on Oct 5.

FINAL SHOWDOWN.
Brazilian presidential candidates, incumbent Dilma Rousseff  L, taken in Brasilia, 7 Oct 2014  and Aecio Neves  R, taken in Sao Paulo, 6 Oct 2014 .
BRASILIA, Brazil – Leftist incumbent Dilma Rousseff and Social Democratic challenger Aecio Neves are fighting to break a statistical tie in the polls a week out from next Sunday s  October 26  presidential runoff.
The contest has developed into the closest-fought in a generation as Neves, scion of a political dynasty, looks to unseat Rousseff, whose Workers Party  PT  has been in power for 12 years.
Having unexpectedly thrashed environmentalist Marina Silva in the first round, Neves, former governor of southern Minas Gerais state, has his nose just in front, polls say.
But his advantage going into this weekend was wafer-thin at 51% to 49%, leaving him and Rousseff in a virtual dead heat.
The past week has seen Neves 54, and Rousseff, 66, engage in caustic debate with both accusing the other of lying and turning a blind eye to graft, a key issue in the debate amid a kickbacks scandal involving oil giant Petrobras.
While insisting he will keep in place extensive PT welfare reform programs after they pulled millions out of poverty in the past decade, Neves has accused Rousseff s administration of failing on the economy by leading it into recession this year.
Rousseff s four years have been marked by low growth which had raced ahead under predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Rousseff fired back by unsubtly referring to 2011 reports of Neves refusing to take a breathalyzer test and insisting that his party, which ruled Brazil for 8 years before Lula triumphed in 2002, would seek to unpick the welfare reforms which have won international renown.
Rousseff, who polled 8% more than her rival in the October 5 first round.
Though many Brazilians fed up with poor public services and corruption say they want change next week s run-off features two candidates whose respective parties have ruled the country between them for the past two decades.
The country is also split down the middle, between the largely PT-supporting, less well off North and the richer South, where Neves  pro-business message is well received.
This is an extremely divisive election.
Mauro Paulino, director of polling agency Datafolha, told Agence France-Presse.
But he explains that, for those in the middle, things are less clear-cut.
The middle class, which grew most under PT rule and forms a large swath of the electorate  at around 36% , is divided between the two candidates.
On the one hand they are afraid to lose the gains associated with the PT, such as access to consumer goods.
But on the other, there is a feeling of indignation as the process of life getting better has been interrupted.

Positive news out of Brazil to start the week has provided the country’s stock market with a much-needed boost.
Marina Silva came in third with 21 percent.
Since any president in the country must have greater than 50 percent of the votes to be elected, Rousseff and Neves will have a  run off,  and will have to fight for the 21 percent that backed Silva.
The rally in the stock market was likely caused by the surprising support for Neves, who was widely written off as a contender.
Running under the Brazilian Social Democratic Party  PSDB , Neves is a business man who has pushed for increased trade and lower government spending; he s what many people believe will help bring Brazil out of its current economic downturn.
Brazilian stocks have been up across the board this week, and some of Monday s biggest winners are below.
Shares MSCI Brazil Index Fund ETF  NYSE: EWZ   is comprised of a basket of companies based in Brazil.
7 percent.
Shares MSCI Brazil is down 3 percent over the last six months.
The news on Monday sent the ETF up 6 percent to a new one-week high.
A.
NYSE: BBD  , meanwhile, is one of the largest banks in Brazil, and has spiked on the news of the presidential run off.
The more ground Neves gains on Rousseff, the more shares could benefit.
The largest energy company in the country, Petrobras, is a top holding in iShares MSCI Brazil, and also rallied on the election news.
It is an oil and gas company that operates in Brazil as well as internationally, and it s involved in every aspect of the industry including exploration, production, development and sales.
Rousseff, the current President, has instituted price controls on what consumers pay for refined products, which cuts oil companies  revenues and profits.
Neves  election would undoubtedly help the company’s bottom line, as he has a much different outlook on the economic regulatory situation.
It is up 11 percent over the last six months, including 13 percent on Monday.
Ambev, through its subsidiaries, produces, distributes, and sells beer, draft beer, soft drinks, other non-alcoholic beverages, and food throughout the Americas.
2 percent.
Ambev is down 10 percent over the last six months, but has spiked 4 percent on the election news.
Success by Aécio Neves’ presidential campaign will likely continue to drive Brazilian securities out of their current downturn.
The run-off is set for October 26, and as the polls swing back and forth, it could add to the already high volatility in the Brazilian stock market.
As of this writing, Rousseff is the favorite to remain president of the country, but as the first election displayed, anything can happen.

Can Brazil s stock market predict an election?

S.
Now that the World Cup is over, media attention has shifted away from Brazil for the time being, but only temporarily.
Brazil has an upcoming general election in October to decide both the President and National Congress, which can have far-reaching effects on related markets.
Presidential incumbent Dilma Rousseff is seeking a second term, but investor sentiment suggests that her ticket may not be well received.
Most would agree with the notion that when the general public is dissatisfied and overall sentiment is negative, those in office tend to receive the blame.
In the case of Brazil, Rousseff s approval rating has been steadily declining since last year, which is not surprising when you look at investor sentiment.
The Bovespa, Brazil s benchmark stock index, dropped nearly 40% since Rousseff took office to the July 2013 low.
The stock market is one of the best barometers available for gauging and tracking public sentiment, and it is clear that it has overall been poor in Brazil over the past three years.
But is there any causal relationship between stock prices and a presidential incumbent being re-elected?
S.
As my colleague Avi Gilburt aptly suggested in his June 2012 article titled,   Will President Obama Be Re-Elected? ,  there is plenty of evidence to support a relationship based on our own presidential history.
S.
However, when equities were in a strong downtrend during a second-term election, the incumbent was ousted.
Brazil is a bit of a unique situation, though.
While the downtrend in stock prices there over the past three years is abundantly clear, as a technical analyst, I see substantial evidence that the correction has already completed.
Therefore, it is very possible, even likely in my opinion, that the Bovespa will remain in an upswing come October when the actual election happens.
At the very least, I expect price to still be above the 2013 low.
The stock market tends to lead public opinion, though, so even if Brazilian equities have bottomed, the overall message that investors sent Rousseff during her presidential term is clear.
In fact, one could even argue that part of the Bovespa s recent strength can be attributed to the anticipation that new leadership is about to be welcomed into office.
Rousseff s competition is Aécio Neves, president of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
Many investors are expecting a lighter government hand in the markets if he wins, so it is not surprising that we are seeing the anticipation of his victory through price.
When both technical and fundamental analysis starts to align, it is time to pay attention.
What would a Rousseff defeat mean for Brazilian stocks going forward?
I believe it would confirm that the Bovespa has put in a long-term bottom and started the next upswing towards a new all-time high.
The technical side of analysis is already suggesting this; all we need is the right fundamental catalyst to come along, which the upcoming general election will serve perfectly for.
39% linked at the bottom of this article, is starting to break out above strong technical resistance, with both price and the RSI recently clearing their respective downtrend lines.
This bottoming action is encouraging for a low in place, which is also supported by examining the price structure of the rally this year using Elliott Wave Theory.
In Elliott Wave Theory, trending price moves take on a structure of five waves whereas corrective moves exhibit a three wave substructure.
764 Fibonacci retracement of the rally into the 2011 high.
This is a strong signal that the next trending price move on the weekly scale has begun, which can take price to roughly $78 next to complete wave  i  of iii as shown on the chart.
If history is any indication, Brazilian stocks are telling us that investors, along with the public in general, want new leadership.
Couple this with the technical breakouts that we are seeing on Brazilian equity charts, and it appears that we have a recipe for very favorable market conditions going forward.
As such, there is tremendous long-term opportunity for investors interested in Brazil, which has likely only just started.
Adding portfolio exposure to Brazil using quality ADR stocks could pay off handsomely if the upcoming election results are what I expect they will be.

CURITIBA, Brazil — With their hands raised, hundreds of Pentecostal churchgoers worshipped Sunday night in Brazil, seeking divine blessings for themselves and for a nation electing its next president.
Out!
Out!
Out” they shouted in unison, chasing invisible demons from this 2,000-seat megachurch in Curitiba.
At the same moment, pollsters were revealing that Brazil had delivered a stunning rebuke to the Pentecostal presidential candidate Marina Silva, who failed to advance to a second-round runoff just weeks after being projected to win it all.
She placed third behind President Dilma Rousseff, who is seeking another four-year term, and center-right challenger Aecio Neves.
Both identify as Roman Catholics.
Interactive Google map of Brazilian election results.
She says she’s an evangelical, but she’s on one side of the wall and then the other,” says Alessandre Freitas, a head pastor of the largest branch of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in the state of Paraná, his voice still hoarse from the two-hour service.
What we want is someone who can open doors for the church.
Evangelicals today account for nearly a quarter of Brazil’s population, five times what it was several decades ago.
But skepticism toward Silva and a failure of evangelicals to rally behind a single candidate illustrates that this still-fragmented group has yet to turn its growing clout into a unified political force.
Silva could still play an influential role in the coming weeks, as her endorsement might tip the scale when Rousseff and Neves go head-to-head Oct.
26.
But in analyzing what happened on Sunday, it’s also evident that Silva’s own evangelical community will remain an untamed and unpredictable voting bloc.
The evangelical electorate remains fragmented,” says Andrew Chesnut, a professor of religious studies focused on Latin America at Virginia Commonwealth University.
Silva has described a miraculous healing in her youth as the impetus for converting to this charismatic style evangelical Christianity that invokes the power of God to cure the sick and chase away demons.
In August when her party’s initial presidential candidate was killed in a plane crash, Silva called it “divine providence” that she was not also on the plane.
But support from evangelicals was never a given.
One of Brazil’s largest and wealthiest evangelical groups is the Universal Church, led by billionaire Edir Macedo, who is personally close to Rousseff; the two stood shoulder-to-shoulder in July during the inauguration of a $300 million mega-church in Sao Paulo, and Rousseff supported Macedo’s son’s bid for governor of Rio de Janeiro  which made it to a second-round runoff .
Silva, a member of the Assembly of God church, could not even garner full-throated support from her own denomination’s leader, Silas Malafaia, who said he would vote for a fringe conservative candidate in the first round and Silva only in the second round — a chance that will now never come.
In a way,” says Prof.
Chesnut, “yesterday’s election was also a contest between the country’s two Pentecostal titans.
The Universal Church has recently begun building another 5,000-seat mega-church here in Curitiba at a cost of $122 million.
During the service Sunday, the congregation stood with its hands outstretched as the pastor promised blessings over the hum of a piano synthesizer and beneath a ceiling emblazoned with a glowing neon cross.
To be sure, many evangelicals did see Silva as God’s anointed.
Marina speaks with God, the others don’t,” said 57-year-old churchgoer Fatima Mendes.
Rousseff and Neves both identity as a Roman Catholics, which make up about 65 percent of the population.
But standing beside Mendes at the Universal Church, her son said he was concerned by Silva’s waffling on social issues and what that signaled.
Silva] doesn’t give me faith,” said the 19-year-old.
Despite such splintered opinions, Brazil’s evangelical voting bloc is showing increasing clout in local politics.
The Universal Church here in Curitiba rallied behind three church leaders running for congressional seats, and one was elected to state senate.
Evangelicals may have enough clout to determine the outcome of elections at a local level, or in legislative positions,” says Rodrigo de Sousa, a professor of religion at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie in Rio de Janeiro.

The folks who run the country, some that is, the ones stealing with both hands need to be shot.
The government can only prop up the poor with cheap gasoline and subsidies.
Change is coming, probably not this election, hence nothing changes but more slow down.

With days to go until Brazil s presidential election, the race for the top is tightening.
The leading candidates - current President Dilma Rousseff and her opponent, Marina Silva - have been stepping up their campaigns in large urban centres.

If Dilma Rousseff  PT  fails to win the fifty percent majority on election day, a second round will be held on October 26th.
RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL — With her unconditional backing of former president Lula, some had suggested incumbent president Dilma Rousseff could win the 2014 election in the first round of the 2014 elections.
However the announcement of Marina Silva as candidate for the Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB , along with competition from Aécio Neves of the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy  PSDB  means a second round is likely.
Marina Silva of the PSB and Aécio Neves of the PSDB are leading candidates challenging the incumbent president Dilma Rousseff, image recreation.
The first stage of Brazil’s general election will take place on October 5th and, if Dilma Rousseff, representing the Workers Party  PT  fails to win the fifty percent majority, a second round will be held on October 26th.
These have been seen as important elections at a crucial moment in Brazil’s development and eleven candidates are running for the country’s top job, the most since 1998.
Brazil has over twenty different political parties but most fall into alliances formed around four major parties.
Current president Dilma Rousseff is seeking her second term representing the Workers Party  PT , which has an increasingly center-left profile and has governed the country since 2003, when Lula first came to office.
Having served time in jail for her association with a Marxist guerrilla group under Brazil’s dictatorship, Rousseff worked her way through the ranks of the PT party to eventually be Chief of Staff.
Then Lula personally endorsed her as his successor.
Rousseff’s leftist policies are not favored by private business but while she has been criticized for what some deem as excessive state involvement in the economy, she has recovered her position from a 2013 dip when mass protest swept the country.
Marina Silva was officially named as the representative for the PSB last week.
Brazil witnessed a great outpouring of grief over the death of Eduardo Campos and it is thought that part of this will be reflected in growing support for Silva and the PSB.
Marina Silva has had an impressive political career and was the presidential candidate for president Green Party  PV  in 2010, winning twenty percent of the votes.
Since her official announcement as candidate, support PSB has surged and it is thought she is attracting voters who were previously undecided.
Silva’s environmental record and humble background provide good public support but she is distrusted by Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector and some think her campaign is one of paradoxes.
An outspoken Evangelical Christian, Silva is also linked to Brazil’s biggest private bank, Itau that represents the country’s growing oligarchy.

In second position for much of the run up to the election, Aécio Neves the candidate for the center-right PSDB has been pushed into third place and his previous hopes of attracting those who want “anyone but Dilma” look unlikely to come through.
Ex-Governor of Minas Gerais  2003-2010  and current senator, Neves’ coalition brings together right-wing parties and will run a highly funded campaign.
Big business supports Neves, and the stock markets would favor his win that could potentially lead to an increase in foreign investment and the PSDB would take a more rigorous approach to cutting inflation.
Currently in fourth place, Pastor Everaldo Pereira represents the right wing Social Christian Party  PSC  and has considerable popularity among Brazil’s growing number of evangelical worshipers and leaders.
The most recent poll of voter intention was released by Datafolha on August 15th and showed Rousseff in first place with 36 percent, marking a three month low.
This was followed by Marina Silva with 21 percent, an increase of twelve percent for the PSB and Aécio Neves in a close third place with twenty percent of the vote.

Presidential candidate Marina Silva of the Brazilian Socialist Party gives the thumbs up as she attends a rally campaign in Guarulhos on September 5, 2014.
Brazil will be be holding its general elections on October 5, 2014, to elect the country s National Congress, president, state governors and state legislatures.
You mustn’t expect politicians in a democratic system to come up with ideologically pure, intellectually consistent policies.
Their job is to put together a winning coalition of voters who have different and even conflicting interests, and if that requires compromises and even contradictions, so be it.
But they must appear to be consistent, and Marina Silva has mastered the art.
Until last month Silva was the vice-presidential candidate of the smallest of Brazil’s three main parties, a woman with a national reputation as an environmental activist but little prospect of high political office.
President Dilma Rousseff was cruising serenely towards re-election in the first round of the elections on Oct.
5, despite the fact the Brazil’s once-booming economy is in a recession.
And then a small plane crashed.
Marina Silva was supposed to be on that plane, but changed her plans at the last moment.
All seven people who were on board died, including the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Socialist Party, Eduardo Campos.
With the election campaign already underway, the PSB had no choice but to promote Silva in his place, and suddenly the election became a real race.
She is bright Green: her own party, which she took into coalition with the PSB, is called the Sustainability Network.
Even more importantly in a country where half the population is non-white, Silva is a “caboclo,” the mixed-race combination of native Indian, black and white that is common in the Amazon.
There has never been a serious presidential contender who was black before.
Only two weeks after Silva was chosen to replace the late Eduardo Campos, she has tripled the PSB’s support in the opinion polls.
There is now almost no chance that Dilma Rousseff will win outright in the first round of the elections.
The polls predict that Silva will come second to Rousseff in that round – and then beat the incumbent by 47 percent to 43 percent of the votes in the run-off three weeks later.
All very well, but what would Marina Silva actually do as the president of Brazil?
It’s an important question, because Brazil, the world’s fifth largest country  200 million people , is going through difficult times.
Over the past 12 years the governing Workers’ Party has lifted 40 million Brazilians out of poverty, but economic growth has now stalled.
Many people blame the government’s highly protectionist policies.
Silva is a plain-speaking woman with no allegations of corruption trailing her around  as they do so many other Brazilian politicians , but she has been remarkably unforthcoming on what she would do about the economy.
This is because she now heads a political coalition whose major member, the PSB, is actually “business-friendly,” as they say.
Silva’s plans for the environment are equally obscure, beyond the well-known fact that she disapproves of giant hydroelectric dams in the Amazon  and she hasn’t even cancelled any of them .
She still talks like a Green, but her vice-presidential running mate, Beto Albuquerque, was responsible for pushing a law legalising the use of genetically modified soybeans through Congress.
She is, in other words, a “typical politician” who is trimming her sails to the prevailing wind.
She accepted Albuquerque as a running mate because she needs to appeal to the agribusiness sector, which accounts for almost half of Brazil’s exports and a quarter of the economy.
On the other hand, despite her pursuit of business support she is still strong on environmental issues in general and an end to the deforestation of the Amazon in particular.
This is not consistent, and ideologically pure Brazilian environmentalists are already disappointed in her, but she has nothing to apologize for.
She has put together a set of policies and a coalition of supporters that are inconsistent and sometimes downright contradictory, but they may deliver her into the presidency.
And that is the point of the exercise, after all: without power, policies are irrelevant.
Brazil seems to be following President Dilma Rousseff’s ambitious agenda quite well.
The country successfully hosted the 2014 World Cup, securing itself as a major political player, and recently created a new development bank with its BRICS counterparts, paving the way for greater economic influence.
Now, Rousseff is moving towards the next point on her agenda: winning October’s presidential election.
On October 5th, Brazilians will go to the polls to elect a new president.
While President Rousseff is highly favored to win re-election, an economic recession as well as further corruption cases in Petrobras, the country’s multinational oil and gas company, could harm her chances.
To show her determination to Brazilians and to win re-election, Rousseff needs to revive the Brazilian economy and reduce government corruption before October.
A poll by Datafolha published on Thursday, July 17 shows that for the first round of voting, Rousseff has 36% of the vote, followed by Senator Neves of the Social Democracy Party  PSDB  at 20%, and Governor Campos of the Socialist Party  PSB  at 8%.
While the poll is consistent with the past year  which showed Rousseff at 47% in February , the decrease in support is concerning for the president.
In fact, the president’s approval is dropping to the point where she tied with Neves in Datapoll’s second round of polls between the two top candidates.
A recent poll comparing Rousseff to her main challenger Neves revealed a technical tie of 40% to 40% between the two candidates.
This is bad news for the president.
Earlier that month, a similar poll on a runoff between Rousseff and Neves had shown 46% favoring Rousseff and 39% favoring Neves.
Since then, it appears Rousseff’s upper hand has slipped.
This change is not so much reflective on increased support for Neves, but rather of decreasing support for Rousseff.
In fact, the number of people supporting him has not changed since early July.
As with most presidential elections, the state of the economy is a huge indicator of how happy a population is with the incumbent candidate.
Of all respondents in Brazil, 58% expect inflation to rise.
This has frustrated voters who despite still supporting Rousseff’s re-election compare her presidency to Lula’s, who oversaw growth in employment and the economy.
Rousseff has downplayed the threat inflation poses, but this political tactics is unlikely to convince voters as purchasing power decreases and the economy continues to stagnate.
If inflation is not tackled before October, it would provide Neves with another target against Rousseff.
5% benchmark set by the Central Bank.
Similarly, 42% of Brazilians also expect an increase in unemployment, while 36% see the economy to muddle through, while 32% expect it to worsen.
7% for 2015.
5% for 2015 .
To jumpstart its economy, Rousseff would need to reduce the state’s intervention, provide incentives for investment, and diversify its trade with the rest of the world.
One way to revitalize the Brazilian economy could be by expanding trade with the United States, with whom trade is highly diversified.
Rouseff could also expand trade with other partners such as China and the EU.
To accomplish these tasks, however, could mean a decrease in government expenditure in popular programs.
Decreasing support for public programs would undoubtedly come at a cost to Rousseff’s support.
These policies have become the cornerstone of the Workers’ Party’s platform and any reduction could lead to further disappointment with Rousseff’s government.
On the other hand, as the July poll shows, the president needs to gain the vote from non-PT voters, meaning that economic reforms need to take place before October to demonstrate that she is serious about restarting Brazil’s economy even if it means cutting popular social programs.
Rousseff must weigh these options and determine which economic move is the most strategic.
Meanwhile, Brazil’s oil giant Petrobras is tangled in scandal as corruption allegations grow.
On Thursday, July 17th, prosecutors charged Jorge Luiz Zelada, Petrobras’ former CEO, with fraud .
Similarly, the National Congress is investigating these allegations, with members of Rousseff’s coalition siding with the PSDB opposition in creating an investigation committee .
The corruption accusation could undermine Rousseff as a presidential candidate, as one of the cases occurred while Rousseff chaired Petrobras’ Board of Director.
The resulting break in ranks within Rousseff’s Congressional coalition this past March reveals a discontent with the political status quo.
Finally, the government’s tight control over gas prices has cost Petrobras over $30 billion in the past three years, a financial leakage that has increased the company’s debt.
However, with the upcoming elections and the 2016 Olympics just around the corner, the government is unlikely to raise gas prices.
In order to fix this issue, gas prices should incrementally increase to alleviate the financial pressure on Petrobras.
Rousseff should also help the ethanol industry by ending the gasoline subsidies, which would make ethanol more competitive, providing her with the additional narrative that her government is fighting climate change.
The president needs to tackle these corruption and economic issues before October by collaborating with the congressional committees and prosecutors.
Similarly, Brazilians will go to the poll faced with the question, how do we best solve these challenges?

Dilma Vana Rousseff, the 36th and current President of Brazil.
When challenger Marina Silva pulled ahead of incumbent Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff in the polls a few weeks ago there was a lot of excitement in the US business press, and Brazilian financial markets.
Rousseff s Workers  party  PT  has been in power for 12 years, and a lot of rich and powerful people were ready for a change.
Fortune seemed to favour them: the Brazilian economy, having slowed considerably over the past few years, officially went into recession this year – something that would spell the end for many incumbent presidents.
Before that, there were street protests over the rising cost of public transport and government spending on the World Cup , and the event itself ended in disaster with a humiliating 7-1 defeat for the national team at the hands of Germany.
Yet Rousseff has bounced back from every blow, and now looks poised to come out on top in both the first and second rounds of the election.
How did this happen?
If she is re-elected, it could be because the majority of Brazilians are looking at her party s 12-year record and, for those old or literate enough to remember, comparing this to the past.
For the vast majority, the changes are quite striking .
5% annually from 2003 to 2014.
This was more than three times the growth rate during the preceding two terms of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso , who implemented   Washington Consensus   policies and remains a much-preferred statesman in the US capital.
Before Cardoso there was a decade-and-a-half of even worse economic failure, and income per person actually fell.
This return to growth, plus the government s use of increased revenues to boost social spending, has reduced Brazil s poverty rate by 55% and extreme poverty by 65%.
For those in extreme poverty, the government s internationally renowned conditional cash transfer programme – Bolsa Familia – provided 60% of their income in 2011, up from 10% in 2003.
A hefty increase in the minimum wage – 84% since 2003 after adjusting for inflation – also helped quite a bit.
3% when Lula da Silva took office in 2003.
The quality of jobs has also increased: the percentage of workers stuck in the informal sector of the economy shrank from 22% to 13%.
Brazil s income distribution remains one of the more unequal in the world, but there was significant progress here too .
From 2003 to 2012, the 40% of the population just below the median nearly doubled their share of the country s income gains, as compared to the prior decade.
This came at the expense of the richest 10%.
The poor have most obviously benefited from this transformation of the Brazilian economy, and this is reflected in the polls .
But it is not just the poor who improved their wellbeing: with a median household income of only about $800, the vast majority of Brazilians were set to gain from the rising wages, shrinking unemployment and significantly increased pensions that the past decade had brought.
From the elites  point of view, these gains that ordinary workers have made are not such good news.
A law requiring full-time domestic workers – of which there are a lot in Brazil, thanks to its crushing inequality – to be treated as formal employees , with maximum work hours, minimum wages and social security, was another recent annoyance for the  haves .
A counter-narrative that the country under the PT is on the road to ruin has filled the media in Brazil, which is mostly against the government, and the international press.
In this view, the economy has slowed because the government is not sufficiently friendly to business.
5% , is too high, fuelled by a labour market that is seen to be too tight, and the government, it is argued, needs to cut spending.
Another opposition theme in the last election, which has been recently resurrected, is that Brazil should be more friendly to the US and its highly unpopular foreign policy in the region.
The reality around Brazil s economic policy is that the government, since the end of 2010, has listened to  big finance  a bit too much, raising interest rates and cutting spending when the economy was too weak.
Hopefully these mistakes will not be repeated.
If Rousseff wins, it will be because the majority of Brazilians got a lot of what they voted for.
They may want more, and they should – but they are unlikely to opt for a return to the past.

Summary: The tools are aimed at involving citizens in the upcoming elections in October.
As campaigning for the upcoming general election kicks off in Brazil, the government has launched a range of apps intended to improve citizen engagement and inclusion in the process.
The Superior Electoral Court  TSE in the Portuguese acronym  will make three mobile apps available to provide information about candidates and the actual voting process, as well as results.
All apps will be available in Android, iOS and Windows Phone versions.
The first tool - and perhaps the most interesting of the three apps - was launched on Friday  18  and provides detailed information about the candidates.
The elections to be held in October will not only elect the president, but also the national Congress, state governors and state legislatures and involve some 24,000 candidates across the country.
Through the TSE app, citizens are able to see the candidate s basic information such as full name, his or her party and any coalitions associated to it.
The TSE website, however, has a section that displays more detailed data about the contenders such as declared assets and forecast campaign spending - but it is not linked to the app.
A separate application will inform citizens about the voting process in Brazil, where voting is compulsory, such as wards and electoral divisions and will use geo positioning to inform the best route to get to the voting location.
This app is not yet available.
Another tool, also yet to be released, will inform real-time results once the actual election starts.
Since 1996, voting in Brazil uses compact, portable voting devices and a centralized process that is able to process even close elections within hours.
The government providing information about candidates sounds like a really bad idea.
Who decides what goes in there and how it s worded?
Candidates and parties furnish their own info which the state publishes together with the voluminous analysis, text, and arguments for and against ballot propositions.
A copy of the resulting booklet is mailed to every registered voter in the state.
Been happening twice every even numbered year for longer than I ve been alive.
John L.
The laws that regulate the electoral process in Brazil specify lots of data that any candidate must supply in order to have his or her candidacy officially registered and being legally able to stand for election.
Other data come from the government databases, such as the Central Bank and Serpro  the federal data processing service .
Only plain objective data are provided, they are highly standardized, and they ultimately come from the candidates themselves and their political parties.
Some examples: former offices held, previous convictions, and personal wealth  as declared to the Federal Revenue Secretariat, the Brazilian equivalent to the IRS .
I can t see how that would be a problem or how those data could be manipulated.
On the contrary, it serves a very important social function in making the electoral process transparent and helping voters make an informed decision.
