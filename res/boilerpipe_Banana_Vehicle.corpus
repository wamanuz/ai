B Wilson and his toaster car visits the Big Banana Car in Kalamazoo.
You aren t crazy.
B.
Wilson of Los Angeles, according to the banana car s driver and promoter, Tom Brown.
After driving from Los Angeles to Chicago this week, Wilson and his  Pastry Resistance,  as it s known on its Facebook page , came to Kalamazoo to visit Steve Braithwaite, builder and owner of the banana car, Brown said.
As for Braithwaite, his next project is in the works.
Later this summer, Kalamazoo-area residents could be seeing a submarine sandwich driving around.
According to banana car promoter Tom Brown, the new art car will be almost as long as the banana, but will be able to seat 12 people, rather than just three.

Touring the world in a vehicle shaped like a Banana might be ridiculous, but it is also exactly what brothers Steve and Spade Braithwaite are planning to do this coming spring.
Steve Braithwaite moved to the US from England over two decades ago and has been building hot rods ever since.
His latest creation is the  Big Banana Car , a huge Banana shaped vehicle that started life as a 1993 Ford F-150.
After examining a Banana from every angle Braithwaite decided that constructing a Banana shaped vehicle was not only possible, he was going to be the one to do it.
After two years of construction, that is exactly what Braithwaite has.
The Braithwaite s Big Banana Car world tour isn t only about touring the world in a ridiculous homemade fruit-shaped vehicle though.
The two brothers plan to use the trip to promote awareness of deep vein thrombosis, which led to their mother s death.
With the help of their  Big Banana Car  the pair have already raised $1200 for the cause and they hope it will be much more by the spring when they set off to tour the world in their custom Banana-mobile.

Like one poster said-it cuts the wire rather than mashing it, plastic barrel melted when under a 5 amp DC load then came apart when I removed it from the power-point socket.
Even at half the price it d be too expensive.
Intended to use if a plug on other equipment failed or when I wanted to test something.
Wasted money and effort on this one - Radio Shack can do better.
Purchased this to power my 100 watt ham radio from a 20 amp vehicle power port.
It was well fused  thankfully , and remained in the cigarette socket all the time.
After about 3 months of use, I noticed the radio would go off and then come back on.
Eventually, the radio had so many  surges  of applied power, that it started working erratically.
When I removed the cigarette plug to inspect it, the positive tip end just fell off.
Attempts to screw it back into the housing failed.
It repeatedly kept falling out off.
I don t understand how something screwed together could come apart, when it was never removed from the socket.
The threads seemed to be OK when initially installed, but they sure wern t when it came apart.
No one touches my truck but me, so this remains a mystery!
Tip fell off and was impossible to reassemble.
The split body with threads spreads when attempting to re-thread the tip.
Very easy to install and great replacement part for original equipment.
When you put in a wire and tighten the connector, the wire tends to get cut rather than mashing against the surface.
Excellent Product.
I use it to quickly install or remove my dual band ham radio transceiver from my vehicle.
Got this for my truck to plug a cb radio into and it drained by battery with about 5 minutes of use and next time tried to start my car didnt start.
I use this type of plug when the manufactures plugs fail.
Have not had any wear out yet.

This custom banana on wheels is powered by a Ford 302 motor, and rolls on a Ford F150 truck frame.
The owner stated that the frame was un-modified with the exception of the extended front & rear bumpers.
We got an insiders demo as to how they  Peel the Banana,   Code word: for flipping back the stem  allowing for the  The Big Banana  safe passage while passing under bridges.
The Banana Car hails from Pennsylvania, and was seen here in Spring Hill, Florida.
The giant Banana is an everyday driver, and can often be seen out & about running errands.
No pun intended.

2  UPI  -- A pair of Michigan men said they founded a successful advertising business using their custom-made  Big Banana Car  to promote businesses.
Tom Brown of Kalamazoo said his partner, Steve Braithwaite, constructed the Big Banana Car from a 1993 F-150 with added fiberglass, foam, wood and other materials, The Kalamazoo Gazette reported Monday.
Brown said he knew he was looking at his future career when Braithwaite pulled up in the banana car for their breakfast at Denny s.
He pulled in and I said,  Dude, this is it.
This is what we re looking for.
Brown said.
Brown and Braithwaite, who met while selling aerial photographs and address signs together in Muskegon a few years ago, said they have since found success using the car as a promotional tool for companies including Planet Smoothie, Chiquita and Del Monte.
Brown said of the car when used as a promotional tool.
The men said they have received inquiries about using the car in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami and Houston, where the vehicle won first place at an art car show.
Brown said he and Braithwaite are hoping the banana car makes enough money to build a second vehicle, likely a submarine sandwich car.

In 2008, Steve Braithwaite was standing in line at a Michigan gas station when a bunch of bananas stole his attention.
The England-native picked one up and began ruthlessly analyzing it.
He looked at the fruit s angles, studied its dimensions, noted its color.
The line before him dwindled down, but Braithwaite stayed still, stuck in a banana daydream.
She gestured to the line building behind him.
Braithwaite recalled to the The Huffington Post.
Braithwaite switched gears from distracted to determined.
He went home, rang his brother Spade, and the two decided to construct a fully-functioning banana car.
Four years later, 52-year-old Braithwaite, his brother, and photographer Liz O Neil plan to banana their way around the world.
And they re looking for a fourth passenger.
Braithwaite said.
Before these worldly dreams ripened, though, the brothers had to design a vehicle capable of global mileage.
They had experience in building hotrods and knowledge of how to make amusement park props.
The Big Banana Car married those skills, Braithwaite says.
But -- why a banana?
Braithwaite explained.
Together the brothers stripped down a 1993 Ford pickup for its frame.
Over the next two years, with help from friends, they sawed plywood, welded a skeleton, perfected a body, and painted their toy a notorious banana-yellow.
By 2011, it was road-ready.
The Big Banana Car is 23-1 2 feet long.
Braithwaite used actual bananas to get perfect dimensions.
Braithwaite s neighbors check out the early stages of the Big Banana Car s frame.
Braithwaite poses with the 1993 Ford pickup truck that he used as the base for the Big Banana Car.
The Big Banana Car gets the same mileage that the pickup used to get.
Here s the car in one of its earliest stages.
Here, the skeleton is almost finished.
A friend helped Braithwaite out with the welding, to make sure the frame stayed together.
The whole project took about two years to complete.

Braithwaite offers rides in the Big Banana Car.
The potassium-less car s overwhelming resemblance to the fruit would fool a hungry King Kong.
It stretches 23-1 2 feet long and ranges from 8 to 10 feet high, when taking its stem into consideration.
Braithwaite has a button to fold down that stem for low bridges.
The car gets about 14 miles per gallon and is completely legal.
En route, the car became an instant hit.
Braithwaite received invitations to events from Boy Scouts picnics to the World s Largest Art Car Parade in Houston, Tex.
Big Banana Car’s crew.
Couch surfing allows Braithwaite to estimate a world trip at $30,000.
He believes in strict budgeting.
Even if someone was willing to throw down $500,000, we wouldn t stay in hotels,” he said.
So where’s $30,000 going to take them?
It s about starting at point A and just heading east till you arrive back at point A,” Braithwaite said.
Atlantic Ocean  by cargo ship  to England, “do Europe,” as Braithwaite puts it, go through Asia to Shanghai, China, then cross the Pacific Ocean to Long Beach, Calif.
If we can find the funding, we’ll add two more continents to that plan,” the 52-year-old said.
Braithwaite mans the wheel, but a love for adventure drives the Big Banana Car.
Braithwaite’s mother’s life a few years back.
It was awful, but my mother was the type of person who’d say, ‘This is just what happens.
Enjoy your life.
Don t mope,’” Braithwaite recalled.
Big Banana Car fans can donate money or – if they’re lucky – pay for a banana ride.
But if he can’t physically give people a lift, Braithwaite hopes to encourage folks to stop living life vicariously.
I m an absolute average Joe,” he emphasized.
If this trip can inspire people who are just like me to just jump into the volcano, that s what I d like to happen.
The whole idea’s ludicrousness doesn’t weigh on Braithwaite.
Once a fourth passenger and funding are secured, he’s set to split.
This is your life,” he said.
It s been a long road, but HuffPost Weird News has finally reached its high point in awesome.
HuffPost Weird News Executive Editor Buck Wolf said that the Wienermobile had a nice texture, but was a bit too salty for his taste.

NEWINGTON >> Call it the case of the banana-eating bandit.
Police in Connecticut say they’re looking for a man who smashed his vehicle into a gas station in Newington, swiped a banana from a shelf and ate it before leaving early Wednesday morning.
Nothing else was taken.
The man was gone before police arrived.
Authorities describe him as a black man who was wearing a brown hat, dark jacket and dark pants.
Police say the station wagon has damage to the driver’s side taillight and rear bumper.
The object of the Banana Game is to find as many Yellow or  banana colored  vehicles as possible before you reach your destination.
Enjoy playing on long car trips!
Decide the players.
It means ascertaining who is going to play.
Usually, this is everyone in the car.
Scan the environment.
Begin looking around until you find a yellow colored vehicle.
Shout  BANANA!  when you notice a yellow vehicle.
If you don t, it does not count, and someone else can call it.
Whomever gets the most points is declared the  Top Banana .
If you see a UPS Truck, shout  MONKEY!  and you automatically win the game.
You can now start over or play a different game.
Tell us everything you know here.
Remember, more detail is better.
Provide Details.
Please be as detailed as possible in your explanation.
Don t worry about formatting!
We ll take care of it.
Don t say: Eat more fats.
Do say: Add fats with some nutritional value to the foods you already eat.
Try olive oil, butter, avocado, and mayonnaise.
Do not call any orange cars as Banana.
If someone calls an orange car a banana, inform them that it is obviously mustard colored.
The driver should NOT participate.
This could be endangering to the passengers and fellow drivers.
If two people call the same vehicle, a  Banana Split  occurs.
In this instance, the next person who calls a car wins the  Split  and gets two points, one from the first and one from the second.
If the same two people call the same car AGAIN, repeat and add another point until a single person calls a car.
Some people can be very competitive.
Please do not take this game too seriously.

Steve Braithwaite sits in the driver s seat of his Big Banana Car in front of a closed nightclub in Allentown, Pa.
Steve Braithwaite isn t nuts, but he is a bit bananas.
Braithwaite and his brother, Spade, are the proud owners of the Big Banana Car, which they plan to drive around the world next spring.
The idea to make a car shaped like a banana came about a few years ago, when Braithwaite was in a gas station paying for a fill-up and spotted a bowl of fruit.
Braithwaite tells Guy Raz, host of weekends on All Things Considered.
And that s exactly what he s done.
To create his mobile banana, he bought a 1993 Ford F-150 and removed the body.
Then, he built the skeleton shape of a banana over the engine and suspension, covered it with chicken wire and sculpted it into a banana shape.
The final touch, of course, was airbrushing the car yellow.
Construction took two years.
But there is a more serious side to the quest.
The Braithwaites are using it to promote awareness of deep vein thrombosis, which led to their mother s death.
They ve already raised more than $1,200 for the cause.
Braithwaite says.

Dodo Juice Banana Armour Hard Car Wax 250 ml.
A tropical  wax for warm colored vehicles.
Dodo Juice  Banana Armour Hard Wax breathes new life into warm colored vehicles with a blend  of carnauba wax, yellow beeswax and banana oil.
Banana Armour Hard Wax dries to  a mirror-like, hard shine that repels the elements and looks great doing it.
Dodo  Juice Banana Armour Hard Wax is made with a high percentage of carnauba to give  it that hard, glassy finish.
It only takes a little of this wax to shine and  protect your entire vehicle.
Expect fantastic water beading and great  durability.
Use Dodo Juice Banana      Armour Hard Wax on any warm colored vehicle to bring out the subtle hues and      highlights.
Dodo Juice Banana Armour Hard Wax glows on reds, yellows,      oranges, and warm metallics.
We like bananas, because they      probably grow on Mauritius.
And let’s face it, dodos would have lasted a bit      longer if they could have unzipped them with their beaks, then enjoyed them      with rum and brown sugar on a barbecue.
Therefore, in tribute to the humble      banana, we have named our hard wax for warm coloured cars ‘banana armour’.
It also sounds like an 80s girl band, but that’s only if you’re old enough      to remember.
Following on with the warm theme, we      have used some Yellow Beeswax in this recipe and, er, made it yellow and      bananary.
Bananary isn’t a word, by the way.
I just made it up.
Dodo Juice Banana Armour Wax.
As with any car wax, we’ve found      that the best results are obtained on a clean, smooth paint finish.
Use a      prewax cleaner, like Dodo Juice Lime Prime Pre-Wax Cleanser, to      remove old layers of wax and improve the paint’s texture.
Then apply a layer      of Dodo Juice Purple Haze Soft Wax using a soft foam applicator or with your      bare hands.
Allow it to cure for 5-10 minutes.
Since the cure time is      relatively short, we found it easiest to work in sections.
Buff off the wax      with a soft Cobra Deluxe Jr.
Microfiber Towel.
Apply another coat      after 24 hours if desired.
8 oz.
Dodo Juice Banana Armour Hard Car Wax 30 ml.
However, turning the little sucker over i read that it can be used to wax approximately 4 vehicles which gave me a relief since i do not give my car a full on wax more than twice a year so the actual value goes far with this product.
The wax itself spread easily on my freshly decontaminated metallic blue paint and gave it a nice shine and smoothness.
Would recommend the small size for those who want to experiment with DoDo Juice products as most of them are amazing quality.
Amazing Shine!
I used Dodo Juice Banana Armour on a  speed yellow  Porsche Cayman after washing with Born To Be Mild and using Lime Prime Lite.
The Banana Armour makes the yellow really pop.
I highly recommend product, as well as Born To Be Mild and Lime Prime Lite.
A very durable and wet wax!
It s in my top 3 of my arsenal which includes WG Fuzion!
I own a car that is painted in a very warm yellow with a nice metallic flake.
I have used many a wax, and nothing has made the metallic flake show as well as this.
Its got a great smell as well!

Information coming soon.
A British expat has spent $25,000 turning a car into a giant banana which can be driven.
Steve Braithwaite, who is originally from Woodstock, Oxon, but now lives in Kalamazoo, Michigan, is the owner of the unique motor.
It took the 54-year-old two years and $25,000 to realise his vision.
Let s split!
Unsurprisingly,  the car is a real head-turner for everyone it drives past and has  become a big hit at motor shows and children s birthdays.
Mr Braithwaite said:  The best thing about the banana car is when kids see it.
I get people doing double takes like you see in the movies all the time.
It can be a curse having this car if you re in a rush.
Mr Braithwaite had the idea to make a ridiculous car for a while but only started building it in 2009 after a chance meeting with a fruit basket.
He said:  One day my former wife came home from grocery shopping one day and suggested I build a bananacar but I just laughed it off.
Under the almost two tonne banana s bonnet is a 302ci Ford V8 - which Mr Braithwaite believes makes it the only fruit to have a V8 engine - allowing it to reach a top speed of 85mph.
After being spotted around town, people started to request its attendance at birthday parties, which Mr Braithwaite s friend Tom Brown was all too happy to arrange.
Now its popularity has grown and the car has made corporate appearances for companies as big as Del Monte.
However, that wasn t the vehicle s original purpose.
He said:  Originally the plan was to travel from the States, across the Atlantic to Blighty, then cross Europe and Asia, finally leaving China to cross the Pacific and come home.
Mr Braithwaite moved to America in 1987 when he was 26 after watching the film American Graffiti.

Who is this week s top commenter?
That is a real headline.
And here’s something you don’t see every day.
It would be rare enough to see a boxy Scion with two pieces of “toast” protruding from the roof, but match that with an open-wheel banana car?
You have one of the strangest sights a motorist could witness.
Leave it to a place named Kalamazoo to feature such a sight .
The Michigan town was the setting of the rendezvous of these two breakfast items.

The toaster car and Wilson have since headed out to upstate NY, but for a brief period of time, two very unique vehicles got together to make a healthy mobile snack.

Liz O Neill.
Liz proved invaluable, not only during the construction of the Big Banana Car but also as an able co-pilot when criss crossing America in the finished vehicle.
Glen Lewis.
Glen is not only a very skilled auto mechanic but he is someone who doesn t need much direction.
Give him the basic outline of a job and he goes non stop, working quietly until suddenly you look over and it s finished.

The two Genes are both very skilled auto mechanics and they see solutions before I have even noticed the problem.
They are our favourive pair of Genes.

I had heard stories of a mechanic in the area that sounded too unlikely to believe.
Tall tales of a  Mechanics  mechanic.
A guy that other auto repair shop owners go to when they are stumped.
With some vague verbal directions whispered in a hushed voice I set out on a quest to find this man and enroll him in the Big Banana Car project.
After a winding twisting journey through the roads of Pennsylvania I found myself standing before the gate to his kingdom.
However, it was after 5pm on a Friday and he had gone home for the weekend.
With a tear in my eye I turned and left, vowing to return on Monday.
When I went back on Monday I outlined the big banana car build and trip and the particular needs I had and stood back as he pondered my request and I nervously awaited his decision.
I ll help you  he said  on one condition.
I said  Not a problem                  I presumed that he wanted to help but was embarrassed about working on a huge banana and didn t want his friends to find out but it turns out that, unlike me, he is just a very humble guy and simply wants to avoid the lime light.

Jim Lacy and his team  Jim, Jim and Jim  did a really wonderful job of laying down the yellow base paint.
They were very nice to work with and Jim himself had an almost constant grin and kept shaking his head in mirth every few minutes.

The team from Yerkes Auto in Quakertown ran all the brake lines, hooked up the master cylinder and booster and bled the system to give me a strong brake pedal.

You can use any of those words to describe a theft that seems so utterly pointless that you’ve got to wonder why anyone went to the effort to pull it off.
Because buying a banana for what, a quarter?
That’s a lot easier than ramming a gas station with your car to steal one.

Cops showed up at the gas station in the wee hours of the morning upon a report of an active burglary alarm, and found the entry doors had taken quite a beating.
After watching the surveillance video, police saw the suspect pull up in a station wagon and repeatedly back into the doors until he smashed an opening in the glass.
He then walked into the store, unmasked and apparently making no effort to hide his identity, grabbed a banana from shelf, and went to town.
After peeling and eating the object of his desire, he simply walked out of the store in the same vehicle he used as a battering ram.
Here’s a hint: Stores will sell you bananas and you don’t even have to subject your personal property to damage or wreck a gas station in the process.
I know, crazy!

Dr.
Charles Arntzen displays some of his vaccine-carrying tomatoes.
When Dr.
Charles Arntzen of Arizona State University visited Thailand in 1992, he was not expecting a moment of scientific  eureka  that would redirect his career.
However, after observing a young Thai mother soothing her fussy infant with bits of banana, this plant molecular biologist was struck with an idea that is both startling and ingenious.
What if, in addition to quieting her child, the mother could also administer a life-saving vaccine  in the banana?
Arntzen s vision is well on its way to becoming reality, thanks to a combination of dedication and applied biotechnology.
As the president emeritus of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, founding director of the Arizona Biomedical Institute, and member of the President s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Arntzen is well equipped to handle the challenge he has undertaken.
His breakthrough lies in forging a link between green plants, foreign DNA, and vaccines.
Vaccination stands as one of modern medicine s greatest success stories.
Early experiments by Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur taught physicians they could prevent disease merely by exposing a patient to a weakened or inactivated pathogen.
While his protocols violate today s clinical trials regulations, Dr.
Jenner was able to prevent children from getting smallpox - even when he deliberately exposed them to it - after first inoculating them with the pus from cowpox.
Today, most new vaccines contain a specific protein or set of proteins proteins from a pathogen of interest and not the pathogen itself.
A protective immune response can result from this more limited  and inherently less risky  exposure.
Though materially different from those developed by Jenner and Pasteur, modern vaccines, including Arntzen s, still build upon the same fundamental principle: If the immune system is trained to recognize a pathogen prior to infection, the disease can be prevented when the actual pathogen is encountered.
Disease prevention via an edible vaccine is great news for people around the globe.
The problem with current vaccination protocols - and the passion behind Arntzen s research - is that what works in the developed world is often much more difficult to deliver in the developing world, or simply too costly to pruchase.
A vaccine that requires a sterile syringe, refrigeration prior to injection, and repeated booster shots is difficult to implement in many countries.
Unfortunately, this often means that the people who most need a vaccine cannot get it.
In a discussion of his work, Arntzen points out that  each year diarrhea kills about two and one-half million children under the age of five.  He persuasively uses such horrendous statistics to champion his cause.
While Arntzen s edible vaccine is likely to win approval from children everywhere, there are actually significant medical advantages to this route of administration.
An oral vaccine incorporated into a plant bypasses the need for sterile syringes, costly refrigeration, or multiple injections.
Furthermore, since many of the developing world s most deadly diseases - cholera, rotavirus, and E.
The trick with an edible vaccine is convincing a plant to express the genes of a foreign organism.
Fortunately, Arntzen s prior work prepared him to face this challenge.
As a biochemist, his career focused on unraveling the means by which photosynthetic membranes in plants capture solar energy.
What we ve done for the last ten years is try to change the cellular machinery of a plant by adding a new gene, cause that gene to make a new protein, and coax the new protein into folding to the desired shape so that it accumulates.
That something new was vaccine development.
Will these bananas one day replace vaccination with needles?
When Arntzen started investigating the vaccine issue in the early 1990s, scientists were already using genetically engineered yeast to produce proteins for injection vaccines.
Arntzen s experience with green plants led him to consider other options.
Would it be possible to use a higher plant instead of a lower plant, something we already know is an agricultural crop?
Indeed, modern technology enables Arntzen to insert specific genes from a foreign organism into the genome of a green plant.
Progeny plants will then produce the foreign protein.
If the foreign protein happens to be an immunity-inducing pathogen protein, an edible vaccine is in the making.
Yet the challenges of science are not the only obstacles Arntzen faces.
This type of project requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating the skills of many types of basic and clinical scientists as well as experts in product regulation and distribution.
No biochemist can make progress in moving something forward on his own.
I need linkages with people who do immunology.
I need people in vaccine development.
In fact, satisfying regulatory policies has been one of the most painstaking elements of Arntzen s work.
He is determined to demonstrate that his vaccine passes the rigorous requirements of the Food and Drug Administration, thereby silencing any critics who would accuse him of  dumping  experimental technology on the world s poor.
Indeed, an interview with Arntzen reveals him to be passionate and articulate in explaining the rationale behind his work.
His ideas involve sophisticated science and technology, but his motives are grounded in a genuine concern and humanitarian interest.
Not everyone agrees with him, though.
In an interview with Nova and PBS in October 2000, Dr.
It s a ploy to convince relatively well-to-do people in the industrialized world to approve of this technology.
While directed at genetically modified foods in general and not specifically edible vaccines, her comments do strike at the heart of the debate over genetically modified organisms  GMOs  that has also stirred up controversy between the United States and Europe.
Some scientists feel GMOs are safe while others do not.
All of our regulations had been set up in an era in which physics and chemistry ruled.
Critics of GMO technology argue that not enough testing has been done  or is even possible  to ensure that genetically altered organisms will not have negative environmental consequences.
Arntzen recognizes these concerns and much of his time is spent working to first ensure that his work meets rigorous standards of integrity and then to translate that information to the public.
He says,  To a large extent I rely on the regulatory side  to help in the education and acceptance. I have to be constantly alert to those issues because it s always something that can always rise up.  In fact, Arntzen s protocols take such concerns into consideration.
As a result, the genetically altered vaccine-producing plants are not grown freely, thereby minimizing the risk that such genes would be unintentionally incorporated into other species.
From an efficacy perspective, Arntzen s most recent clinical trials are particularly exciting.
Human volunteers who enrolled in a study at the University of Maryland at Baltimore started producing antibodies against Norwalk virus  which causes acute bouts of diarrhea  after eating Arntzen s creations - genetically engineered potatoes.
Negotiations are in progress to start clinical trials abroad with the International Vaccine Institute in Korea, a new center funded in large part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Clinical trials of cholera vaccines are also planned to take place there as well as in Vietnam and Cambodia, regions where cholera is still a serious medical concern.
In addition, during a recent scientific conference held at the Flinn Foundation s Phoenix office, tentative connections were made with company representatives from Egypt and India.
This meeting, organized by Arizona Biodesign Institute on behalf of the Production of Vaccines from Applied Crop Sciences  ProVACS  Center, highlighted technical advances in plant-based vaccines.
We intend to visit India.
For now, all such clinical trials will involve modified potatoes or tomatoes.
Both products can be easily freeze-dried, transported, and reconstituted.
Since many target countries have a long history of herbal medicine, Arntzen is interested in working within already-existing ideas.
In the meantime, Arntzen is still working on the banana vaccine.
His original, utopian vision was of a communal banana tree where villagers could dose themselves.
Unfortunately, this scenario does not adequately address the concerns related to any vaccination protocol - efficacy, quality control, and dosage regulation.
As a result, Arntzen s current efforts focus on tomatoes and potatoes, which have shorter growing seasons, are easier to manipulate in an experimental setting, and can be freeze-dried in controlled doses.
Practicality hasn t inhibited his idealism, however.
To this day he keeps a jar of Gerber s baby food - banana, of course - on the corner of his desk for inspiration.
Arizona s sunny skies and warm weather are known to attract people from all over the world - who can resist playing golf in short sleeves in December?
Arizonans are fortunate that warm weather is also good for growing plants.
A combination of ASU s offer of the Florence Ely Nelson Presidential Endowed Chair and greenhouse opportunities brought Arntzen to Phoenix.
He sounds remarkably like a winter tourist when he exclaims,  The weather is perfect!  Yet unlike the tourists, Arntzen is excited about greenhouse horticulture, not golf.
In its own way, a functional edible vaccine would indeed be a hole-in-one.

Police are looking for the man who crashed into a Citgo station, ate a stolen banana and left.
Newington police said they have identified the man suspected in a bizarre crime early Wednesday morning.
They said he backed an SUV into a Connecticut gas station, stole a banana, ate it and left in the damaged vehicle.
When they reviewed surveillance video, they saw a light-colored Ford Freestyle station wagon with Connecticut registration plates back into the store door several times and break the glass.
The man was not wearing a mask, did not try to conceal his face and did not take anything else, police said.
As you can see from the photo, the man was wearing a dark jacket, dark pants and a brown hat.
He fled in the same car, which has damage to the driver’s side rear bumper and tail light.
Police said today that they have identified him.
The case remains under investigation.
No arrest has been made and police said they will release the man s name if and when an arrest is made.
BOYERTOWN, Pa.
The folks at Walnut Woods in Boyertown got quite a treat Friday.
A giant yellow banana car and a toaster on wheels, complete with two over-sized pieces of bread, pulled up in front of their complex.
Seniors were able to get a close-up look at the cars and pose for pictures.
The banana car seats four and turns heads everywhere it goes.
It was created by a man from Coopersburg, Lehigh Co.

NEWINGTON, Connecticut  NEWS CENTER  -- The Newington Police Department responded to the Citgo Gas Station located at 502 Cedar Street at 1:48am on January 8 for a report of an active burglary alarm.
Upon arrival on scene, officers discovered extensive damage to the north entry doors which appeared to have been caused by a motor vehicle.
No suspects were located at the scene.
Review of surveillance video depicted a suspect, operating a light colored Ford Freestyle stationwagon with Connecticut registration plates, backed into the store entrance door several times creating an opening in the glass.
The suspect, identified as a black male wearing a dark jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat, then entered the store.
The male was not wearing a mask and made no attempt to conceal his identity.
The suspect selected a banana from a shelf, peeled and ate the fruit, and then exited the store.
No other items were taken during the burglary.

It s not everyday I drive from Hur to Mt.
Zion and spot a car that looks like a banana, accompanied by a car that looks like a toaster.
The strange vehicles were parked along Rt.
16 at the Mount Zion Cemetery, the drivers no where to be seen.
Being the dutiful reporter, I waited around a little while to talk with the drivers, but after snapping a couple photos I went on down the highway.
One vehicle had a website across the windshield, so when I got home I looked up the story behind the banana car, and the toaster car.
The Banana Car is on a journey to circle the world.
Steve and Spade Braithwaite, AKA  The Dirty Brothers  are making a documentary film about building a huge banana car and then driving it from point A, around the world and back to point A.

We have encountered several such fascinating folks.
That s another story, coming soon.

The Banana  also known as the Banana Peel  is one of the most common items in the Mario Kart series.
A Banana Peel causes a vehicle to spin-out if the vehicle touches the slippery item.
These items are probably the least effective item in Mario Kart , but tripping on a bunch can effect you greatly.
Banana Peels can either be placed behind a vehicle  this wasn t avaliable in Super Mario Kart  , or be thrown forward down the track.
They can also be trailed behind a vehicle by holding the item button  it does not need to be held for triple bunched bananas ; this protects the driver from incoming projectiles like the Red Shell and Green Shell .
In Mario Kart 8 , Triple Bananas circle around you, rather than go behind you.
Giant Banana .
When a driver hits a Giant Banana, the fruit will split into three normal Bananas.
This gigantic special item can only be used by Donkey Kong , Diddy Kong and King Boo and Petey Piranha , who are able to use any special item.
MK64 s Banana Bunch.
The Banana Bunch is an item exclusive to Mario Kart 64 .
It is a row of five Bananas that trail the user s kart .
Hitting another racer with the trail causes all the Bananas to drop and a crazy sound effect to play.
Mario Kart 64 , it is possible to prevent spinning out from hitting a Banana.
It is accomplished by holding the B button  brake  until a musical note appears over the character s head.
This can only be done if the racer is driving straight; hitting a Banana going into a turn will always yield a spin-out.
Mario Kart 8 s triple banana.
The Triple Banana is served as a replacement for the Banana Bunch, instead of being a row of five bananas, it s now a row of three bananas.
Obstacle for other players.
Shield for green and red shells.
Talk about a fruitful investment.
Mason Arnold relishes the attention he and his com-pany garner around Austin for driving a vehicle with a big banana on the roof.
In turning people s heads, he has turned a company car into a rolling conversation starter, brand fortifier and revenue generator.
Arnold says of the vehicle, one of three fruit-topped Toyota Prius hybrid cars operated by his 8-year-old company, Greenling , an organic-food delivery service.
Arnold couldn t be happier with his decision to purchase a company-owned Prius and top it with a $3,000 epoxy-coated, aluminum-and-Styrofoam banana emblazoned with the company s web address.
600 per month in operating costs.
Even without a supersize piece of produce, a wisely chosen company vehicle can be a productive and versatile investment.
The car Tom Turner was seeking for his legal e-discovery tech company, DSi, didn t have to be fast, but it had to be easy to park, with enough cargo room to haul boxes of documents around downtown Nashville, Tenn.
The one he ultimately chose, a $14,000 CitEcar Electro Bubble Buddy, can be described as something between a golf cart and a delivery van; it s an electric-powered utility vehicle that plugs in overnight to recharge, eliminating refueling downtime.
Even better, the small vehicle can be parked on sidewalks or in vacant spots that are too small for a typical car.
The savings on fuel and parking come out to roughly $1,700 a year.
And thanks to a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government for green vehicles, and the IRS  mileage deduction, Turner expects the CitEcar to pay for itself within three years and then actually start making money if he takes advantage of the mileage write-off.
Like Arnold s bananamobile, Turner s vehicle doubles as a marketing tool.
We periodically get calls from attorneys who have seen it when they re walking around downtown,  he says.  It has also been great for branding.
As a company s image evolves, its vehicle needs change, too.
College Hunks Hauling Junk , wanted a new vehicle that screamed  successful  and  professional.  Friedman and his business partner decided to lease a new Range Rover when they began franchising their concept in 2008.
We used it for meetings with high-end commercial prospects and with the early-adopter franchise owners who invested in our brand,  Friedman says.  We wanted to show them we weren t just a couple of college guys with a truck, but a national brand.
Today, College Hunks Hauling Junk has more than 140 franchise units.
Did the Range Rover help?
Friedman can t say for sure, but he knows it didn t hurt.
Back in Austin, Arnold believes image is everything when it comes to a company car.
The only downside to Greenling s bananamobile?
Low-hanging parking structures.

0086960  , Axel Foley sabotages an unmarked police car by inserting a banana into its tailpipe.
According to what happens in the movie, it looks like doing so causes the car to stall as soon as it starts.
Does that really happen?
Does the banana truly  disable the unit   to use the phrasing spoken by the frustrated Police Chief .
I d think it would be more likely that you d kill the occupants by carbon monoxide poisoning.
Thanks!
Theoretically, if you block the exhaust you can stop a car from running.
Car engines need to  breathe .
They suck in air, combine it with gasoline, and blow the burnt gases out the exhaust.
If the exhaust is blocked, the gases can t vent, and the combustion chamber will still be full during the suck part of the cycle and the engine won t be able to shove more air and gas into the cylinder.
In short, blocking the exhaust will stop the engine from running.
The problem with a banana is that the pressure that builds up inside the exhaust is sufficient to simply blast the banana out the tailpipe.
Your banana plug won t stop a car from running.
Good work pat.
I think if you could get something to stick, it would work.
Even if you managed to plug it up with something that didn t get blown out, the exhaust system could leak, or you could blow apart a joint somewhere in it, and the pressure wouldn t build up enough.
And once you ve caught the potential car-staller, you eat the banana, thereby disarmin  him.
Can t say about a car, but I have seen it done with a motorcycle.
In high school one of the younger neighbor kids was sitting on his 80cc yamaha dirt bike and talking to us as it idled.
The tail pipe on this was about as narrow as a finger.
My older brother stuck his finger in the tailpipe to plug it and it died pretty quickly  note: the bike had not been running long enough for the pipe to be very hot .
My sister s Honda Accord did once stall from a tailpipe obstruction.
I thought,  If Beverly Hill s Cop is accurate, she should be stalling right about -- *chugga* *chugga* *sputter* -- yep, right about now.  I had to melt it free with boiling water before the car would start again.
Course, between Mythbusters and Cecil, no one believes that you can stop a car by plugging the tailpipe, but firmly packed frozen snow will do it, if you have some handy.
I am not interested in any similarity between the described scenario and a porno anyone has seen -- this is my sister we re talking about here.
And once you ve caught the potential car-staller, you eat the banana, thereby disarmin  him.
What if he has a pointed stick?
It can be done with a hard rubber buttplug and a rubber mallet.
Or so I ve been told.
It can be done with a hard rubber buttplug and a rubber mallet.
Just fix the damn thing and leave my private life out of it.
Thanks to all.
I guess I missed that Mythbusters  and Cecil s take on it, too .
This brings up something about bananas.
I have seen a video of a LN2 dipped banana be used to hammer a nail.
I have also seen LN2 dipped flowers shatter like glass when struck.
Are the  vegetable tissues , ie.
In the world of R C, to shut down engines, we block the tailpipe with our fingers  some guys pinch the fuel line, but this starves 2-strokers of the oil and they run lean.
This parentheses comment was added because the SDMB is full of all types .
So, blocking a tailpipe will shut  er down, but I guess it takes more than some bananas.
I ve always heard that a potato is the way to go, providing the potato is of a size that will permit its insertion in the tail pipe.
I ve never seen it done, by the way.
Must cars now come from the factory with a solid, welded exhaust system.
Don t think they are going to blow apart.
Once clamped replacement parts are added, maybe, maybe not.
I m not gonna fall for the bannana in the tailpipe.
I ve always heard that a potato is the way to go, providing the potato is of a size that will permit its insertion in the tail pipe.
I ve never seen it done, by the way.
A potato is what we used in high school.
Being too big was not a problem, but rather in fact was preferable, because you could cram it in tight and the excess area just trimmed away.
It seemed to work.
We did it to the shop teacher s pickup, and the next day it was at the mechanic s, because it had died and he couldn t figure out what was wrong with it.
Then the next day after that, he seemed in a piss-poor mood.
We did it to the car of a student at a rival high school, and I heard that it worked.
However, in both cases, I did not actually see it work with my own eyes.
Must cars now come from the factory with a solid, welded exhaust system.
Don t think they are going to blow apart.
Umm no.
Welding costs money.
Cars are built as cheap as possible.
Factory systems are always clamped in my experience, replacements may be welded.
Actually welding is cheap.
Not a clamp in sight in the last few cars I have bought.
Shaddap!
This brings up something about bananas.
I have seen a video of a LN2 dipped banana be used to hammer a nail.
I have also seen LN2 dipped flowers shatter like glass when struck.
Are the  vegetable tissues , ie.
J ve seen both in real demonstrations: I think it is more a question of geometry: Flower petals are thin sheets that shatter easily, while a banana is a solid junk.
Diesel trucks provide additional braking by blocking the exhaust path.
The exhaust brake is also used to turn off the engine.
If you just turn the key the engine will keep running, since there s no electric ignition system in diesels.
The exhaust brake is operated via a button on the floor with the heel of the left foot.
This brings up something about bananas.
I have seen a video of a LN2 dipped banana be used to hammer a nail.
I have also seen LN2 dipped flowers shatter like glass when struck.
Are the  vegetable tissues , ie.
The notion that things  and especially parts of people  will shatter into fragments when frozen is something that happens in the movies a lot, but not nearly so much in real life.
Things that were fragile in the first place  such as flower petals  are the exception.

If you just turn the key the engine will keep running, since there s no electric ignition system in diesels.
The exhaust brake is operated via a button on the floor with the heel of the left foot.
This may have been true on older diesels with mechanical fuel injection, but modern diesels all have computer-controlled injection; turn the key off, and the computer stops injecting fuel.
Can t say about a car, but I have seen it done with a motorcycle.
In high school one of the younger neighbor kids was sitting on his 80cc yamaha dirt bike and talking to us as it idled.
The tail pipe on this was about as narrow as a finger.
My older brother stuck his finger in the tailpipe to plug it and it died pretty quickly  note: the bike had not been running long enough for the pipe to be very hot .
The difference is that this bike probably had a two-stroke engine.
I saw the same thing as you with a 250cc motocross bike, also with a two-stroke engine.
A friend had loaned us the bike for a day, and although he had reminded us to remove the rain cork from the tail pipe before riding, we forgot about it.
The bike of course ran like shit for several minutes, until we realized the problem.
Some punks in my old neighborhood did this to an old guy s car.
He had trouble starting it; on the third try, the potato flew out of the exhaust pipe.
A banana may not be effective in the exhaust pipe, but it will make a mess of things if introduced into the air inlet, especially in a carburertor.
It would also be effective in the fuel line, and you might be able to cram enough banana into the ignition keyhole to stop a car from working.
If you smear it all over the windshield it will slow things down for a while.
You could also use the hard part at the tip to force open a tire valve releasing all the air.
Introduced into the brake lines it might make the car disable itself at the bottom of a steep incline.
And of course, the peel left on the driveway could disable the driver.
I ve heard of a truck that couldn t start after backing into a pile of dirt that clogged the tailpipe.
Didn t see it myself though.
Back in Texas, they sold fireworks twice a year -- in the two weeks leading up to the 4th of July and the two weeks before New Year s.
There was one type called a Texas Twister, sort of a long cigar shape, and it would shoot around along the ground while whistling and sparking, then explode in a loud pop.
The whistling was LOUD.
They had a version with two wires instead of a fuse, and you wound the wires onto a couple of spark plugs.
Then when the driver started the engine, it sounded like all hell was breaking loose undeneath the hood.
I used to pull that on my father.
It didn t exactly disable the car, but he claimed it was as sluggish as a tank until I took the wires off the plugs.
I ll admit that I seem to have seen far fewer cars with bits of the exhaust system falling off or dragging on the ground in the last several years.
Hasn t happened to anything I ve owned since about the early 90s.
And I remember repairing a few by clamping a soup can around the break in the tailpipe.
I ll stand by the remark that if you have an exhaust system in that kind of shape, it may leak, or the back pressure will simply finish the job of making it fall apart.
Demolition derby cars often route the exhaust straight up and out to avoid killing the motor with a crushed exhaust pipe.
My sister s Honda Accord did once stall from a tailpipe obstruction.
Happened to me once too.
Doing a three point turn on a dirt road, the shoulder sloped off more steeply than I d realised.
I braked too late on the reversing part and embedded the exhaust pipe into the dirt embankment.
Had to dig out space behind it with a stick to get the car to start again.
Potato.
Preferably 2.
Ahhh, high school.
Good times.

The banana caught my eye and I realized that the shape was perfect for a vehicle.
It cost him around $20,000 to build and almost 2 and a half years but at the end what was produced was sheer perfection.
While on a road trip with a friend through Rhode Island on Wednesday, the pair literally drove by the Providence-based Bananagrams headquarters, and spotted the signage.
Braithwaite said.
Delighted employees asked them to wait for the owner to return, and a 15-minute wait turned into an invitation to stay and join forces with Bananagrams for WaterFire.
While the Big Banana Car has only been touring the country for 2 months, Braithwaite has already been pulled over a few times.
In New Jersey, a cop pulled the vehicle over just for a photo op.
In Wisconsin, an ornery officer stopped Braithwaite on the hunch that there might be a restriction on driving a fruit down the interstate.
It turns out there isn’t, but if a high speed chase were to evolve, the Big Banana Car’s 302 Ford engine would make for the most interesting high-speed chase in traffic history.
Braithwaite bragged that on the highway it can get up to speeds of 65 mph, making it the fastest fruit in the world.
Not only is it fast but it s relatively fuel-efficient as well.
15 miles per gallon, about the same mileage as a Ford pickup truck,” Braithwaite said.
But the real kicker lies in how much gas the Big Banana Car can hold.
Braithwaite and company use that impressive gas tank to drive all over the country.
Next year, the Big Banana Car is slated to make its first appearance abroad for an international driving tour.
When traveling such long distances there are bound to be a few bumps in the road.
He jokingly talked about the intense winds he experienced while driving over the Jamestown Verrazano and Newport Bridges.
Overall, Braithwaite and the Big Banana Car are getting enough love to last them through the intense winds and a few too serious police officers.
Receiving generous donations from Bananagrams and Rhode Island senator James Doyle  D-8th District, Pawtucket  they have been convinced to stick around our state a little longer.
To catch your own glimpse, head to Market Square on Steeple Street tomorrow night, where the car will making its WaterFire appearance.
Just watch out for monkeys.
Sunday morning, police arrested a man in Carson City for assaulting a convenience store clerk with a piece of fruit and then crashing his vehicle into a casino.
According to local news, Osvaldo Ruiz was shoved in the back of a squad car after the suspect allegedly struck the convenience store employee with a banana and proceeded to crash his car into Dotty’s Casino.
Officers had to chase down the “GTA” reject as, said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong, this is merely one of several charges that have been added to the suspect’s rap sheet.
He’s currently in jail with bail set at $68,000.
No one was injured during the rampage, save the convenience store employee.
Dotty’s was evacuated and the city shut down all gas and electric power connected to the venue.
The police report noted damage to the lawn as well as the electrical box and one wall connected to the casino.
In April 1981 the Pacific Science Center in Seattle held a rubber-band banana race.
A wonderous fruit is the mellow, yellow banana.
It s easy to hold for eating.
It s easy to get at, with its zipper-like skin.
It s so easy to digest.
And it makes a marvelous component for a small racing car.
That was demonstrated yesterday at the Pacific Science Center in the Seattle Banana 500, a competition in which  peeling out  takes on an entirely different meaning.
The trick was to transport a banana, using the power of two rubber bands, the greatest distance over a 25-meter course.
Dozens of wooden, metal, and plastic contraptions were entered.
Some of the vehicles were mathematical marvels, using pulleys of varying diameters to increase efficiency and endurance.
Some seemed held together by hope and prayer.
Some went far.
Some couldn t be coaxed to travel a meter.
Prizes were awarded by the Science Center to winning entries in each of three classes based on the ages of the builders.
Der Graf Bananalian, whose parts included a helium-filled balloon and a propeller, was judged the most humorous and creative of the 35 entries even though it ran backwards in one race.
It won the Golden Banana Award a $10 gift certificate and a T-shirt  for its builder, Charles Traynor of Seattle.
In Class A  for builders up to 13 years old , the Banana 500 Car, which went 50 meters, raced by Jody Ladle of Kent.
In Class B  for those 13 through 19  the Urbanana Cowboy Car, 25 meters, by Melisse Swartwood of Bremerton.
In Class C  for those 20 and older , Fruit en Route, by E.
Dan Kinney of Federal Way.
That classy cart went 72 meters, tops for the day.
Then there was the Banana Saturday, an ingenious  balsa-wood racer with big wheels and ball bearings.
The car was built by Morris Wilson, a Boeing engineer.
It had traveled 100 meters under ideal conditions but wasn t aimed properly in one event and hit a center rail.
It settled for a second-place finish.
To prepare for the Banana 500, Wilson and his wife, Nancy, did a study of bananas in which they concluded that bananas lost weight as they grew older.
Their vehicle carried a banana that weighed 122 grams last Wednesday but only 113 for the race.
Competing bananas could weigh no less than 112 grams.
CARSON CITY, Nev.
KRNV  -- A man was arrested early Sunday morning after hitting a convenience store clerk with a banana and later crashing his vehicle into a nearby casino.
East Long Street.
Ruiz crashed his vehicle into a natural gas line at Dotty s Casino and caused the temporary evacuation of the casino.
Carson City Sheriff s Office and Carson City Fire Department both responded to the incident, but no injuries were reported.
Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said Ruiz has a long criminal history in the Carson City area.
Ruiz was booked into the Carson City jail and his bail is set at $68,300.
Ever notice anymore all the crime blotters are plagued with names like Gonzalez,Ruiz,Ortega,Melendrez,Jurez and Pedro?
Could there be a pattern here?
Glad to see Harry Reid and Limited Liability Corporations are bringing in more cheap CRIME RIDDEN LABOR!
I m sure this pile of waste will be turned loose again.

I might have driven over a curb today while parking.
My, my.
See, like that SUV over there,  he pointed to a newer model of my vehicle.  Its grill is shiny, not like ours.
It is so not chicken wire.
Connor s favorite car: the Lamborghini.
But, the other day, he admired a marashino-red Cadillac.
I did, too.
Natalie glanced at the car.
Natalie tootled around the pond one recent afternoon with a gorgeous redhead.
Liza bailed at first.
But, the trooper that she is, she gave it another go and enjoyed Sunday driving with her girl.
We took the less-scenic, quicker route back to Southern California.
Interstate highways all the way, baby.
The highlight of the drive: This road sign.
I ve got a thing for Smokey the Bear.
Have you seen his fire-prevention spots lately?
Has he always been so cut, so buff?
So deep of voice?
My, my.
But back to Southern California.
We set up camp for the night in a hotel near the airport and then explored Manhattan Beach.
We had several hours the next day before our late afternoon flight, so we ate lunch and then Connor and Natalie convinced us to rent bicycles.
Little Girl was over the moon about the pinkness of the bicycle that was Just Her Size.
A bald-faced lie, I tell you.
I spent my childhood with a bicycle under my backside.
I cruised the neighborhood.
I rode to the beach.
I jounced over dirt trails through the woods.
I could ride a bicycle.
But it has been a while.
When I perched my bottom upon that beach cruiser and sallyforthed, I nearly took out a few runners with my inability to remember that I had to pedal backward to brake.
I couldn t steer and think at the same time, it seemed.
After the first mishap, I laughed, embarrassed, as I tried to steady myself.
The second time it happened, I admonished myself with a  Really, Jennifer? Steer. Straight ahead. Keep pedaling. That s all you ve got to do. Steer and pedal. Steer and pedal. Steer. Pedal.  The third time it happened, I pretended that I really had meant to crash into the wall separating The Strand from the beach, that it was all part of my master plan: I had stopped so abruptly to take some can t-miss photos.
I ve got photos to show for my my bicycle-riding efforts, all right, so all s well that ends up photographed.
After our little bicycling outing, we wandered up to the airport, navigated the chaos that is air travel, and flew home to Texas.
I spent my summer vacation.
The urchins experienced a first in California: Ice cream from the ice cream truck.
An ice cream truck trolls our neighborhood here at home, but I m Old Curmudgeon Mom who doesn t want her children to eat ice-cream-truck ice cream.
I haul out the übermom within me and insist that the ice cream served at the small dairy-grocery down the road is of way better quality: The processing plant has its own dairy.
The dairy cows aren t given growth hormones or antibiotics.
They eat a vegetarian diet of food grown on the manufacturer s own farm.
Wholesome cows equals wholesome milk equals wholesome ice cream, I tell them.
My first-ever ice cream cone came from Pam s ice cream truck.
I remember standing under the dogwood tree in our front yard, confused as my mom and older sister ate their cones, which looked an awful lot like cardboard to me.
I asked.
My first job at 14 years old was serving up ice cream at a Carvel ice cream shop.
I was fired.
Something about putting too much ice cream on the cones.
There s something Freudian there, I just know it.
But back to California.
The ice cream truck jingled its happy—albeit tinny—tune, and the freshly showered  read: de-sanded  little ones made tracks for treats.
Yes, that s me claiming to have never met myself.
But I m not the point of this post.
My intense Natalie is.
So many times I tell her,  Everything is not an emergency. Take the drama down a notch.  That girl is all or nothing: When she is happy, she is the exuburant soul of happiness, skipping and singing, pirouetting and laughing.
When she is sad, the sky has fallen, pink has ceased to exist, and ballerinas are mythological creatures.
And when she is mad, yowzers.
Don your pith helmet.
Carry a shield.
Run for cover.
It s on.
So, when Natalie and Connor s argument in the back seat intensified as we drove past horses and cattle in fields, I figured that I ought to look for a safe spot to pull over so I could encourage them to wave the white flag.
Connor said, clenching his teeth.
Styrofoam.
That s right.
Connor countered.
I kept quiet.
I had to.
I mean, I named Trouser  Trouser,  after all, which is not exactly a name either.
I didn t even try to tell Connor that most names start out as  not names.   Rose  was most likely a flower before it became a girl s name.
The same with Heather, Lily, Daisy, and Poppy.
I wasn t appalled when Gwyneth Paltrow named her daughter  Apple,  because, like I said, all names start somewhere.
One day,  Styrofoam  just might be a name.
Although it is trademarked, so .
Anyway.
Sty!
Ro!
It s times like these when I wish that I had a soundproof partition between the front seats and the back seats, limousine-style.
I d drive along, happy as a honeybee, oblivious to the tumult in the back seat.
Instead, I twisted around in the driver s seat and hoped that I could get a word in edgewise.
Dudes.
The horses aren t even ours.
We don t get to name them.
No matter what name you think that the horse should have, we do not get to name the horse.
The rancher does, and the horses probably already have names.
You re turning what could have been a creative little way to pass time on the road into a big old argument.
Not fun.
Not a peep.
I waited 30 seconds more, and then, figuring that the argument was over, I eased out of the gravel pull-off that I d found and we continued on our way.
Connor said, staring out the window.
Yes, it is.
I picked it.
Good times.
Jennifer Linney.
How I know that I celebrate far too excessively when I parallel park perfectly on my first attempt: Natalie and I spent much of last week touring preschools.
I drove right past one of our prospects and doubled back.
Oo!
Are we going to parallel park, Mommy?
Jennifer Linney.
All Rights Reserved.
We puttered quietly down the road, over train tracks and through school zones, past longhorn cattle and long-lashed llamas.
As we slowed to a stop at a traffic light, Natalie spoke up from the back seat.
Mommy?
Oh, Mommy.
It s OK.
Connor will sit still,  Natalie assured me.  He won t wiggle.
He won t turn.
He won t jump, dance, or leap.
Sweet girl, having such faith in her big brother.
I m still not going to let him ride the bus.

Look!
Half a moment later, an older couple walked by, hand in hand.

Jim and I scurried about the house in the predawn hours, loading the truck  him  and gussying ourselves up  me .
We scooped our wee little sleepers from their beds and bid Trouser a sad farewell.
Our neighbor had graciously offered to look after Trouser while we were gone.
By 5:45, we had ditched the dry heat of north Texas and started our trek south for the humid heat of Houston.
Because that s how we roll.
We buy high, sell low.
We trade more tolerable dry heat for heavy humid heat.
Call us contrarians, why don t you.
En route, we saw Italy, but not Europe.
And Palestine, but not the cradle of civilization.
By hour four on the road, Connor and Natalie began peppering us with  Are we there yet?  Natalie sang and looked for horses.
Connor kept his eyes peeled for turkey vultures and Volksbuggies .
We arrived in Houston by noon and ate lunch.
Natalie napped, while Connor—dear restless Connor—paced the perimeter of the hotel room like an old man with insomnia.
No offense to any old men with insomnia who might be reading, mind you.
Later that evening, we went to Jim s brother David s house.
The magnolias were preparing to burst.
The porch was in full bloom.
We ate our fill of wine, cheese, fruit, and Italian food and made our way back to the hotel with two tuckered little urchins.
Tomorrow, we head for the sand, surf, and sun.

I m no horticulturist, but my African violets grow like no one s business.
I ll make no bones about it, I take good care of them: I keep them well watered, and I supplement the water with vitamins.
I scout out the sunniest spots in the house so the plants can bask to their hearts  content.
I trim wilted flowers and leaves.
I make sure that the soil level is just right.
I like to imagine that my grandparents , who did have green thumbs, would be proud.
I won t get into the unfortunate fate that my spider plants met.
It was all my doing.
Lately, though, despite my efforts, the African violets have been looking a bit, well, peaked.
More wilted leaves than usual.
Torn leaves and broken stems.
I ve attributed the torn leaves and broken stems to Connor, who, I suspect, has been using the plants as voodoo dolls to take out his frustration with me and my  silly rules,  as he calls them.
Like he says, silly.
As for the wilting?
Cut to Sunday night: I carry a basket of laundry upstairs, where I plan to sit and fold and keep company with Jim and Netflix.
I have recently discovered the no-longer-running series The Riches, and I am intrigued.
As I tote the basket toward the couch, I step on Matchbox cars.
With my bare feet.
Again.
My allergist once joked that he and his wife and their three grown sons have the toughest feet ever from years of stepping on Matchbox cars barefoot in the middle of the night.
I m following in their footsteps.
So to speak.
I had asked Connor to put away his cars, but he obviously hadn t followed through.
I place the woven-twig laundry basket on an ottoman and get down on all fours to scoop the little metal vehicles from the floor to a canvas bin.
African violets and loading it into the beds of his Matchbox trucks.
If you re gonna play, play real, is his mantra, I suppose.

I hope to register Connor next week for kindergarten.
Connor is not too happy about the idea of kindergarten, but the thought of riding a school bus thrills him to the bone.
Me, not so much.
I m a catastrophic thinker, and the catastrophic thinker in me has noticed that school buses don t have seat belts.
Hell, the mother in me has noticed that school buses don t have seat belts, and I can t reconcile that with how I have done this whole parenting gig for the last six years.
When I was pregnant, I didn t drink alcoholic beverages, I didn t smoke and never have.
I made sure that everything I consumed—food, drink, medicine, and even the air that I breathed—was good for the babies I carried.
I researched baby products thoroughly before we purchased them.
I scouted out what I thought would be the safest car seats for our children.
This past March, the American Academy of Pediatrics  AAP  advised  that children ride in belt-positioning booster seats until they have reached 4 feet, 9 inches tall and are between 8 and 12 years of age.
The AAP recommended that children ride in the back seat of cars until age 13.
I ve got to admit it: I cheered just a little bit.
Like Pretty Woman s Vivian Ward, I m a safety girl.
We re a month and a half away from Connor s first day of kindergarten, and we re thinking about how he will get to and from school.
Should I drive him?
Should he have the experience of riding a school bus, The Big Yellow Cheese, as a boy in my freshman-year college dorm called buses?
I ve poked around the Web and discovered that every state in the United States requires children to wear seat belts or sit in safety seats in passenger cars, but only a handful of states—California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—require lap or three-point seat belts on large school buses.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires three-point seat belts only on smaller school buses.
Although our state—Texas—requires that school buses bought after September 1, 2010, come equipped with three-point lap-shoulder belts, funding issues have made seat belts on Texas school buses a rarity.
Our county, meanwhile, has been identified as one of six counties in Texas with a high number of serious bus crashes and a large number of students riding buses on high-speed, two-lane roads.
The upshot is, most school buses in the United States have no restraints of any kind.
Children are expected to sit still in the seats and let the high seat back in front and behind them cushion the blow of a collision.
Connor has been buckled in a car seat every time he has riden in a car.
He holds a hand while walking through parking lots.
We lock up our medicine and household cleaners.
He doesn t run with scissors, although he does use them to cut his sister s hair .
He wears a helmet when bicycling.
He knows not to open the door to strangers.
But now that he has made it to the ripe old age of five, we are supposed to shoo him out into the big wide world, let him ride a bus to school, and hope for the best?
It just doesn t sit well with me.

I ve heard it said that each person has their own best way of communicating: Some people speak better than they write.
Some write better than they speak.
Some express themselves best through artwork.
Others do best with lyrics and music.
Some find their voice in dance.
But everyone, everyone, has their own best way.
Me?
My elementary school report cards always noted,  Expresses ideas well in writing,  and that always made me wonder: Is the inverse true?
Do I express ideas poorly in speech?
Maybe.
I ve always known that I am more writer than speaker.
I just wish I didn t feel so compelled to prove it to myself over and over  and over  again.

You ll see what I mean.
On Tuesday, Natalie went to some friends  house to play.
Natalie and her three-year-old friend, Hallie, and Hallie s four-year-old sister, Harper, were sitting at the kitchen table drawing with markers and crayons when someone rang the doorbell frantically and pounded on the front door.
Hallie and Harper s mom, Ashley, answered the door and found a police officer standing there on the doorstep.
One of her first thoughts: Something dreadful has happened to her husband.
Thankfully, that wasn t the case.
What was the case, the police officer explained, was that one of Ashley s neighbors had collided with my vehicle while backing out of her driveway.
She damaged my vehicle s rear quarter panel and did a number on her own car.
The police officer knew where to find me because I had left a scrap of paper in my vehicle with Ashley s address written on it.
I followed the police officer to the scene, where the neighbor and I exchanged insurance info and melted under the hot Texas sun.
Soon after, I returned to Ashley s house, and then Natalie and I went on our little way.
Why?
By the time I coaxed Natalie into napping that afternoon, the words  bonked  and  crunched  were just burned on my brain.
I need some claims assistance.
Only once those words tumbled out of my mouth the second time did I realize that I was no longer talking to inquisitive Miss Natalie.
Seriously, Jennifer?
What I mean to say,  I recovered,  is a woman collided with my parked vehicle this morning.
Dr.
Hart asked, unamused.
Yes!
I said, pointing.
One word: Hu-mil-i-at-ing.
So, yeah, I definitely—most definitely—fall into the  Writes Better than Speaks  column.
Without a doubt.
Crunched?
Leaking from her girlie parts?
Eesh.
The one with the wet nose and furry eyelids?
She pants.
A lot.
I named her well: We here at Casa de Linney never tire of saying.
It just fits.
The soft, furry, white one rides along without comment or complaint.
He doesn t seem to mind my choice of music.
He makes no demands.
A dream passenger.
The blue-eyed girl sitting behind Trouser?
Two hands on the steering wheel, Mama.

Kids these days.
I tell you.
Thunderstorms have never been a big hit with Connor and Natalie.
When Connor was a toddler, we tried to ease his fears about the loud booming storms by telling him that thunder was just a noise, that he should imagine a gigantic dump truck dumping a load of boulders.
Our boy liked trucks.
And he liked rocks.
Imagining thunder as a dump truck worked, and the fear went away.
Connor has slept though the worst of storms, including one that dropped hail the size of golf balls.
It has been a bit more challenging to convince Natalie—our girl who fears loud noises—to drink the  It s Just a Noise  Kool-Aid.
She is the girl, after all, who used to cry hysterically at the sound of sneezes.
The noise of a flushing toilet sent her over the edge.
Thunderstorms are a whole  nother panic attack.
Help me!
Heartbreaking.
A thunderstorm came to town Saturday night, and it brought with it 60 mph winds.
Our windows bowed.
We feared that our lone little sapling might not hold its ground against the wind.
We thought for sure that Natalie would wake terrified at any minute.
But Jim had sat with Natalie earlier in the evening, the two of them, together on the patio, watching the storm roll in.
Jim explained the science of thunder and lightning, telling Natalie that thunder is just a sound that lightning makes.
Natalie answered.
Jim said, referring to our friendly neighborhood goose.
No,  Natalie said,  It s just a noise.
Before bedtime, Natalie and Connor pulled their rocking chairs to the back door to watch the lightning and rain.
And that night, the thunder boomed.
The lightning lit up our rooms.
The winds rushed in.
And Natalie didn t wake.
Victory is ours.
So, Natalie has the dirty rotten stinky knack for falling asleep in the truck, usually when we are just minutes from home and naptime.
If I try to sneak her from the truck to her bed, she wakes, thinking that she has already taken the longest.
And then, all is lost for the rest of the day.
She s Madame Grumpy-Grumps by dinner and bathtime, and we all go to bed with scowls on our faces.
So, we were scurrying to get home for a nap, and I was doing all that I could to keep Natalie alert and awake.
I yammered incessantly about everything and anything I saw out the truck window.
Oo!
Cows!
Look at the cows.
Look, Natalie!
A flag!
Horses!
I exhaust myself.
One day last week, we drove past a vintage red caboose in a neighboring town.
I said, with way too much enthusiasm.
Where?
Where?
Connor chided.
Where is the red moose?
There are no moose in Texas,  Connor said.  It s a caboose.
Ca.
Yes, there are moose in Texas, Connor.
Natalie shot back.
Connor tried again.
She was shouting now.
Very upset.
Natalie .
Connor retorted.
I, for one, had had enough and regretted ever pointing out the red caboose.
And its existence.
That ll do.
Natalie, it was a caboose.
The end of a train.
Where?
Where?
I!
Want!
To see!
I said.
She s sobbing now.
I want to see the moose.
We pull into the driveway, I put the car in park, and I rest with my forehead on the top of the steering wheel, wondering where exactly I went wrong.
Mama needs a nap.
And a new strategy.
Back a few months ago when friends visited from Virginia, we moved Connor s car seat from the middle row of seats in the SUV all the way back to the pop-up third row.
We left it there for a few days after our friends left, because, well, Connor said he enjoyed sitting in the back-back of the truck.
His field of vision certainly opened up—way up.
As we pulled out of the garage one morning, I reached back to sneak-attack tickle the back of Connor s knee, forgetting that he wasn t within reach.
I called to him, stealing a peek in the rear-view mirror.
Now, I would like a simple little plastic squirt bottle, one that you might see at a garden center.
One that I could fill with ice water and keep in the car and whip out at a moment s notice, like a gunslinger drawing a pistol for an old Wild, Wild West gunfight.
And do you know what I would do with that squirt bottle?
Natalie fell asleep in the car yesterday afternoon, just as we drove into our neighborhood.
She threatened to follow suit today.
Yesterday, I thought I just might be able to sneak her into the house and into her crib without waking her.
Today, while driving home from Connor s school, I carried on like a wild woman, doing anything I could think of to keep Natalie awake until we got home.
I startled her, saying,  Boogity-boogity-boo!  She fell into fits of laughter when I sang silly songs.
I tickled her feet.
I turned the music up loud.
I snapped my fingers like no one s business.
My voice turned all sorts of raspy, Natalie s eyelids flittered and fluttered, and she fell asleep just as we turned onto our street.
Curses.
Now, there s two of them.
Natalie received a tricycle for her birthday this year.
One that boasts a push handle so Jim and I can push and steer Natalie along, which is just what our distracted tricyclist needs.
That gape-mouth smile is Natalie s signature  I m happy! I m happy! I m happy happy HAPPY! Ain t no one gonna change that!  expression.
She and I took the trike out for its first ride a week ago.
Natalie was just giddy with delight.
Getting her motor running—and her game face on.
We decided that hair-lifting breeze was too chilly and took a moment to bundle up.
At the top of the hill, she and her sidekick took a moment to explore the little covered storage box on the back of the tricycle.
Curses.
She discovered the loot I stashed there before we set out.
There, on the sidewalk, Natalie enjoyed her very first taste of M&Ms.
The gateway candy.
Refueled with candy-coated chocolate coursing through her wee little body, Natalie set out again.
She pulled off onto the grass when she noticed her old friend, the moon, hanging around nearby.
Natalie called.
She asked why the moon was not asleep, why it was awake during the daytime.
She seemed satisfied with my answer that sometimes the moon likes to see what the world looks like in the daylight.
I figured that I d hold off on the scientific answer for another year or so.

Connor happened to see a Volkswagen commercial while watching the Life series  on the Discovery Channel.
He took a liking to the concept: See a Volkswagen, wallop the person nearest to you.
We ve gotten him to ease up a bit on the punching and thrown elbows, and, here we are, months later, and Connor is still a die-hard competitor.
But not as die hard as me, it turns out.
Jenny.
He s four.
We toughies who grew up in a little beach town on Long Island?
I rather like it.
Connor said something a month or so ago that I m certain made time stand still for just a moment.
The boy who used to talk nonstop about his blue race car with its  FOUR! BIG! ENGINES!   has immersed himself completely in the world of dinosaurs.
He can rattle off which dinosaurs are carnivores, which are herbivores, and which were the fiercest, most dreadful dinosaurs of all.
Earlier this week, he and I were playing  Mama Digs Up an Allosaurus Fossil.  Connor laid still on the kitchen floor, and I pretended to shovel millions and millions of years worth of dirt away from him.
Then, I got a pastry brush and dusted him off.
Natalie helped with that part.
I put my  fossil  into my  truck  and hauled it to my workshop, where I d piece it together and then ship it off to the museum for display.
Connor was playing upstairs later that day while Natalie and I were in the kitchen.
Paleontologist!
At times, I get the sense that my obsession with Calvin and Hobbes during my college years somehow foretold my future: That I d one day have my imaginative, inquisitive Connor.
A boy, who like Calvin, loves dinosaurs and vehicles and pretends that, when he is eating broccoli, he is really and truly a plant-eating dinosaur devouring a forest.
Dinnertime takes some revolting turns: broccoli is trees, spaghetti is worms, fish is pteranodon food.
2010, Jennifer Linney.
I believe, are the words he used.
Connor has adopted a few new phrases.
He is standing in the kitchen, talking, and wiggling quite a bit.
Connor tosses  certainly  into sentences several times a day.
Today, he kept his cool when Natalie played with his cars and trucks, something that often sets him into a panic.
Is that dinner, Mama?
It smells delicious!
Connor s also been doing this fancy sentence-reversal move.
An editor once removed should know the name for the sentence structure, but, well, I m off the clock.
Have been for a while.
I think that after breakfast I ll be in the mood to go upstairs, Mama.
Another morning, Connor saw Jim preparing coffee and dressed in a suit and tie.

Here s another phrase: One morning when we went upstairs to play, Connor had two of his Matchbox cars collide and then had all his emergency vehicles converge on the crash scene.
Connor said.
Oo.
That looks serious.
I asked.
Smokes!
And Connor is all about  not me,  lately.
Oh.
It s not quite  dark,   I corrected,  It s just cloudy.
Connor said.
All of this serves as a reminder that I must.

Police in Newington are looking for the man who they said committed a bizarre crime early this morning when he backed an SUV into a Connecticut gas station, stole a banana, ate and left in the damaged vehicle.
When they reviewed surveillance video, they saw a light-colored Ford Freestyle station wagon with Connecticut registration plates back into the store door several times and break the glass.
Then, a man went into the store, took a banana from a shelf, peeled it, ate the fruit and left the store, police said.
He man was not wearing a mask, did not try to conceal his face and did not take anything else, police said.
As you can see from the photo, the man was wearing a dark jacket, dark pants and a brown hat.
He fled in the same car, which has damage to the driver’s side rear bumper and tail light.
If you see this man in a messed up SUV driving with some bananas please be sure to alert the proper authorities.

Astrid finds an unusual surprise in Hiccup s garage.
So I m just procrastinating from my biology homework here, and -alright, here s the overview.
Basically, it s a modern AU where Hiccup and Astrid are married; saw a photo, found a plunnie, fed it.
One more thing, Toothless is not a cat; he is based off of a concept I found on Tumblr.
I don t own anything, except for the story.
Astrid asked sharply from her garage s doorsteps, gesturing to the large, yellow thing that was poorly hidden under a large, purple canvas.
Her husband froze in his steps, turning around very slowly.
Out of reflex, Hiccup pulled the purple blanket over his body with a hand, his eyes widening at his wife s stern gaze.
Busted.
Hiccup stammered, giving Astrid a half-hearted wave.
Unfortunately, he waved with the hand that was holding the canvas, which, in turn, made him drop canvas that he was hiding behind altogether.
And so the thing was uncovered further.
Quickly, Hiccup scrambled to get the canvas back onto the thing, fixing it in an awkward, half-covered manner before facing Astrid once more.
With the grace of a cat, his wife strode over to the spot at which he stood.
Once more, she pointed to the thing.
Hiccup replied, pointing to a half- fixed engine lying in a corner.
She stated, crossing her arms and motioning her head to the side set.
He pointed to his left leg and shrugged.
Astrid became increasingly impatient as Hiccup turned back to cover the thing and continued with his monologue.
Astrid shouted.
Like a deer caught in the headlights, Hiccup s eyes widened at her outburst.
He froze.
Only his metal leg fidgeted back and forth, which made a harsh grating noise against the concrete floor.
Looks like she really means business, Hiccup thought.
He stammered, his eyes finding their way to a rather interesting spot on the ceiling.
Astrid sent him a glare, prompting him to answer her.
Her husband muttered illegibly.
Astrid scanned the thing one more time.
Hiccup yelled, throwing his arms up into the air with a wild gesture.
A tense silence settled over their garage for a few moments.
Astrid was in utter bewilderment, while Hiccup silently awaited her reaction.
As if on cue  and effectively breaking the two Haddock s stare-down , a black blur came speeding into the doorway –it was Toothless, Hiccup s French bulldog.
Immediately, the canine locked his eyes on his target and sprinted over to his owner.
Toothless jumped around Hiccup s knees for attention.
Hiccup lowered himself to Toothless  level, the dog sniffing his owner with excited chuffs.
Hiccup laughed as Toothless nibbled at his legs with gummy bites.
Astrid watched the scene between Toothless until Hiccup got up again.
Once again, they locked eyes with each other, though they gazed with a more relaxed disposition.
Astrid smirked, now much calmer than before, placing an arm around her husband s neck.
Hiccup nodded, eyes downcast.
Astrid inaudibly gasped, suddenly feeling guilty for confronting Hiccup.
Sheepishly, she cast a glance over the cart.
Instantly, Hiccup s eyes lit up, and, motioning his wife over beside him first, he unfurled the blanket with grandeur.
Toothless, meanwhile, charged for the canvas, and decidedly started to gnaw on it.
It was exactly as Hiccup described it: a yellow banana on wheels.
A banana car.
Hiccup smiled, his happier demeanor already returned.
Astrid was impressed.
Absentmindedly, she smoothed her hand over the leather that covered one of the seats.
She was amazed at all the features he had installed in it.
Hiccup had put a lot of effort into the car s details, and the cart was really neat with well… everything.
Astrid smiled.
Hiccup was never one to do a project half-way.
The engineer finished his rambling with a wide smile.
Astrid was awoken from her daydreaming.
Toothless had already gone back inside their house for the night and was, presumably, in a deep sleep.
You re wonderful, she thought.
Her husband perked his head up.
Shamefully, Astrid looked away from her husband.
Hiccup had worked so hard, and she had ruined the surprise so fiercely.
Hiccup watched her internal battle, and, with the utmost gentleness, he grabbed his wife by the hands, brought her to where he was, and enveloped her in a hug.
Astrid leaned into him, burying her head into Hiccup s shoulders and wrapping an arm around him.
No words were spoken between the two, but the message was clear.
I m sorry.
Propped against the vehicle, Hiccup held his wife in his arms for what seemed like hours.
Nudging Astrid, he decided to break the silence.
She took her fingers out of his hair and looked up at him.
Wanna go for a drive.
He nodded pointedly at a pair of goggles and then back to the banana car.
Astrid grinned.
And the two sped off into the night.

Remember when electric vehicles were just toasters on wheels ?
Not anymore!
Especially with vehicles like this banana-colored all-electric  Varley evR450 sports car.
Varley is an Australian company that up until now has made nothing but utilitarian electric baggage carts and the like.
Then, out of the blue, here’s this speed demon.
So, what’s under the hood?
3 miles per hour.
The base model is said to have a battery range of 93 miles and cost about $213,000.
A 186-mile battery pack is also in the works.
Besides the price, this car could easily compete with the Tesla Roadster with those looks, if they can get it up and running.
But switching practically overnight from airport haulers to halo cars is quite a feat, so we’ll give Varley a few years to iron out the kinks and make a success of the evR450.
It sure got the design part right.
If you’ve been pinching your pennies to save up for a Tesla Roadster electric sports car, it’s time to cash in your savings.
The Oscar Meyer Weinermobile is so popular that it’s got its own fan club, but where’s the love for the other bizarre food-shaped vehicles?
A brother brother duo transformed parts of an old pickup truck into a fantastically ridiculous car called, quite appropriately, the Big Banana Car .
According to Steve Braithwaite , the builder of the fruity yellow behemoth, inspiration for the car came from a fruit bowl in a gas station.
With a little help from some co-conspirators, Steve and his brother transformed an old 1993 Ford F-150 into a rolling four-seat banana.
Braithwaite & Co.
Big Banana Car all around the world, although they haven’t yet settled on a starting point for the journey.
One thing is for sure: wherever it goes, the Big Banana Car is sure to draw amused stares.

Is throwing a banana peel out the car window considered littering?
Yes, because it belongs in a trash receptacle or compost bin.
Banana peels are not made of plastic, but they take weeks or months to break down into soil, and are slippery, smelly bug-attractors between the throwing and then.
What it comes down to is if someone else has to come and pick up your trash  to leave a tidy and efficient public space surface area  after you, it was litter.

Littering is knowingly depositing in any manner litter on any public or private property or in any public or private waters, without permission to do so.
Litter is trash improperly placed so as to be a nuisance or health concern.
Laws regulating litter are primarily state and local laws, which vary by state and locality.
Punishment for littering is usually a fine, but jail terms may be imposed for more serious littering offenses.
Banana Peel would fall under any or all categories of rubbish, refuse and or garbage.

Banana bread is the perfect vehicle for using bananas once they are past their prime.
This recipe was awesome as far as non-dessert style banana bread goes, however I did change the recipe after reading reviews that it lacked flavor.
I did three bananas instead of four and grated a sweet fuji apple into the batter.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Lightly oil a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.
Dissolve brown sugar in coffee in a bowl.
Stir in bananas.
Whisk together egg, egg white, oil and vanilla in a large bowl.
Add the banana mixture.
Whisk together flours, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, salt and baking soda in a separate bowl.
Add to the banana mixture and stir just until combined.
Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
Let cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes.
Invert the loaf onto a rack and let cool completely.

Welcome!
I m Alana, and this is where I write about food, family, and the wonderful chaos that ensues when the two combine.
Come on in and pull up a chair!
Last week, I visited the middle school classroom at the Montessori school where Joey teaches and the girls learn.
One of the projects they started last year was a snack program where they purchase snacks and sell them to the rest of the students several times a week.
The money they raise through the snack program helps to fund trips and other exciting activities, and the kids get to have the experience of running what is essentially a small business.
Julie Haagenson runs the middle school program, and in the end of the summer, she asked me if I would be willing to come in and do some cooking with the kids.
She thought they might be interested in making some snacks instead of buying them, and she was hoping to give them some tools as they moved into the discussion.
The whole program is small- maybe 8 kids if that, and when I walked in last week, they were sitting around a U-shaped table.
They had invited me to come for four sessions over the course of the Fall, and this was to be our brainstorming session about what we might like to make together.
I started with the snacks that they already offer, and we talked about some alternatives.
Popcorn from a bag?
Why don’t we use an air popper?
The result will be far less expensive and taste a whole lot better.
Everyone loves the days when the kids offer goldfish as a snack–I asked if they were interested in learning how to make their own cheese crackers.
As savvy business people, those kids wanted to provide a product that all the other kids in the school would be interested in buying.
And as they considered whether they should start making food from scratch, the question arose as to whether kids would want snacks that were “more healthy”.
Right now, there are healthy snack days  cucumber slices, oranges  and there are the other days  goldfish, bagel and cream cheese .
If goldfish were replaced by homemade cheese crackers, would that be a healthier choice?
Or would it be perceived as one?
I couldn’t help but jump in.
I was raised on health food.
I have always been able to list the seven ancient grains, and I know the difference between white and red miso.
I’ve turned many people on to sprinkling their popcorn with nutritional yeast.
But I don’t think the health label is helping anyone.
Honestly, I think it’s just confusing.
Because whether something is healthy really depends on who you ask and what their definition of the term is.
Are they concerned about their weight?
Then they think whole milk is unhealthy.
Sugar?
Then maybe diet coke is healthy.
Really, I have no idea what the term means.
So what if we choose a word that is in full acceptance of that it means different things to different people?
How about if the goal is good food?
I continue to cling stubbornly to the idea that taste will lead us to the right place.
All summer, I worked with kids in the kitchen at food camp, and they supported this idea with every meal.
There were all sorts of ideas about what was healthy and what their parents wanted them to eat, but in the end, what inspired them and made them sparkle was the first bite.
So many kids went home and cooked for their parents–they left the camp kitchen saying, “I can’t wait for my dad to try this.
I’m no nutritionist.
I can’t even begin to sort through the constantly changing information about food and health.
I start to wade through some of the mess that we’re in around food safety, and I feel like the system is broken, and I’m not sure how to navigate through it.
But I keep coming back to this idea of good food, and of always going towards food that tastes good to us.
It seems simple, I know, but it’s the best I’ve got.
And if there’s a possibility of raising a new generation of people who actually pay attention to what they put in their mouths, and who even can have a sense of whether it feels good or bad in their bodies?
This could be nothing short of a revolution.
And with that, we move to the car snack.
Oh yes, old friend, we’ve returned.
The short story is that the car snack is the granola bar, the energy bar, the bag of goldfish, the fruit leather, or whatever else you pack for your kids to ease the panicked hunger of 3:00.
Of course, it’s for grownups too, and you can eat it in whatever vehicle you choose.
I wrote about car snacks 1 and 2 a ways back, and car snack 3 joins them in the book.
But all three involve a fair amount of butter and varying amounts of refined sugar, and I’ve gotten a bunch of requests for a healthier car snack.
And so I bring you…the banana oat bar.
No white flour, no refined sugar  except the wee bit of chocolate , and no butter or oil either.
1.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Line a 9×13 baking pan with parchment, leaving enough hanging over on the edges so you can pull out the finished product.
2.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, oats, rice cereal, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon, stirring well to combine.
In a second large bowl, combine the banana, honey, yogurt, nut butter, and vanilla.
Stir until the mixture is fairly uniform.
3.
Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ones and stir until they come together into one uniform mixture.
Gently stir in the chocolate chips.
Transfer to the prepared pan and flatten down with a spatula.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until just starting to brown on top.
Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 1 hour before removing from the pan and cutting into squares.
Thank you for all of your awesome recipes.
We didn t realize Hammacher Schlemmer was in the car business, but look at this monstrosity: a semi-globular arrangement that looks like a transmogrified banana or maybe Pacman with a boner.
If you can get past its dog-ugly countenance, it s actually a highway-legal three wheeler that might be useful for trips around town if you don t mind being laughed at.
Since it just goes just 30 miles on a charge, don t be thinking about taking any extended road trips with this 33hp motorcycle-like contraption, but it has a top speed of 70mph so you could probably head out on the highway for a short trip or two if you re able to muster up enough courage.
Plug it into a 110-volt outlet and it takes six hours to charge, but connect it to 220 volts and it takes only an hour to juice it up.
Ha ha ha!
If you really can t stand that banana color, you can choose from a long list of other colors, too, including red, teal, orange, blue, purple, magenta, white, coral, dark aqua, green, lime green, lilac and aqua.
Maybe just paint a clown face on the thing for even more fugly impact.

Save your money; there are much better electric trykes on the way.
Liz O’Neill will not be attending her 45th high school reunion this summer.
But her reason is not the common excuse of busyness, distance, or a dread of meeting old rivals.
The Souderton Area High School graduate plans to see the world from the vantage point of a 24-foot-long banana car.
Why a banana?
Well, bananas are funny, according to Steve Braithwaite, who has been spending his Sundays for the last two years working on the banana car.
The banana has whimsy,” Braithwaite said.
There is a more practical reason as well.
Braithwaite thought bananas were boomerang-shaped until he studied them at a gas station one day.
That’s when he realized that some of them arch up only at the stem end, conveniently allowing drivers a clear view in front.
Before long, Braithwaite was tracing around banana slices and transferring the enlarged shapes onto sheets of plywood.
Then he was off to “the junkyard that time forgot” at a friend’s home in Michigan to salvage the Ford F-150 that would donate its vital organs to the banana car.
Once the cab and pic-up bed were removed, Braithwaite could build a rebar frame and cover it with chicken wire.
A layer of sculpted foam and fiberglass transformed the naked skeleton into the quintessential fruit.
Ron Kutt, owner of RK Services in Sellersville, contributed significantly by donating his welding services, according to Braithwaite.
Building an enormous banana requires space.
When Braithwaite, who makes street address signs, stopped by O’Neill’s Coopersburg home one day, her four-car garage caught his eye.
I couldn’t have found a better place or a better person,” Braithwaite said.
Although she previously used the garage for storage, O’Neill has since turned it into a set for the unfolding drama, wallpapering the interior with a map of the world and hanging posters donated by Barmar Travel, Quakertown.
You don’t have something going on here without getting involved,” O’Neill said.
O’Neill’s involvement has grown to include not only coordinating fundraising, but committing to climb into the banana for her first journey outside of the United States.
I want it to be yesterday,” O’Neill said of her eagerness to embark.
Preparing for the trip has also rekindled a desire to write that O’Neill buried 30 years ago.
She put paper and pen to an idea Braithwaite had for a children’s book and has since found an illustrator.
O’Neill plans to write another children’s book about her upcoming travels.
A serious purpose underlies the worldwide adventure, since Braithwaite hopes to raise awareness of deep vein thrombosis, the condition that ended his mother’s life in 2004.
Deep vein thrombosis is the result of a blood clot forming in the large veins of the legs or pelvic area, and it can be fatal if the clot breaks free and lodges in the lung artery.
Born in Oxfordshire, England, Braithwaite was living in the United States when his mother was successfully treated for cancer.
S.
Sheila Braithwaite was on a plane back to Heathrow when she developed DVT.
Donations to the Vascular Disease Foundation can be made on the Big Banana Car website, or donors can purchase a banana car T-shirt for $15.
Steve hopes that business owners will compete when he auctions the trip’s start and finish line on eBay.
O’Neill will also auction an afghan she is crocheting of the countries on their route.
Steve’s brother Spade planned to accompany Steve on the trip; but since Spade secured employment managing a hotel in Costa Rica, Steve is looking for another traveler to ride in the third seat.
The fourth seat may be filled by a videographer; or it may be left open so that people along the way can pay to ride a few miles, with half of the proceeds benefiting the Vascular Disease Foundation and the other half helping to cover trip expenses.
Despite his mother’s tragedy, Steve said that he doesn’t want the trip to be maudlin.
Mom would want us to have fun,” Steve said.
Steve’s wanderlust was sparked by a motorcycle trip across India several years ago.
The only way to top that is to go around the world in a banana car,” Steve said.
Serendipity will guide the banana car’s route around the world to some extent.
A roll-on roll-off ship will carry the car from Trenton to Southampton, UK.
Shanghai; or he may follow a southerly route along the Silk Road.
The travelers plan to “couch surf,” finding people in each city to put them up for a night and taking their hosts’ suggestions about worthwhile sights along the way.
The banana car recently passed a specialty vehicle inspection, which was documented by filmmakers Vince Clemente and Dan Billups of California.
Some remaining body work and yellow paint should make the banana car road-ready by the end of June.
Steve is not sure how fast the vehicle will go but said he will find out when he puts it in a wind tunnel at the Ford Michigan Proving Ground.
The entire trip should take three to four months, Steve said.
In the meantime, people can take a ride in the banana car at the Car and Bike Show and Community Day sponsored by Sal’s Pizza Randa, Quakertown, May 1.

Any resemblance to the Banana Lady s costume and or performance is purely coincidental.
If you spot a woman wearing a banana costume, resist all impulses to snap a photo of her.
If the woman wearing the suit is named Catherine Conrad, there’s a good chance she’ll sue you.
S.
Court of Appeals, Judge Richard Posner, writing for the three-judge panel, took the unusual step of not just ruling against Conrad , who lives in Madison, but of advising lower courts to stop allowing her to file lawsuits.
We cannot end this opinion without remarking her abuse of the legal process by incessant filing of frivolous lawsuits,” Posner wrote.
This is at least the eighth case she’s filed in federal court since 2009, and she has filed at least nine cases in state court since 2011.
The case in question involved Conrad suing a credit union trade association after attendees at its event took photos of Conrad’s performance and posted them to social media sites, which she alleged was in violation of her contract.
Posner agreed with Judge Barbara Crabb, of Wisconsin’s Western District in Madison, that Conrad’s suit was without merit.
He went on to point out that “banana costumes quite similar to hers are, we are surprised to discover, a common consumer product” and even produced a Google search URL for such get-ups.
Posner also pointed out Conrad’s record of litigiousness.
She has filed suits in state and federal court against her former lawyers, and once sued her web hosting company for taking down her website after she failed to pay the bill,” he wrote.
The web host had paid $4,000 to compensate her for ‘lost business’ while the website was down — even though it was down because of her failure to pay.

She should loan the banana costume to Walker, for all his  by invitation only  shows!
Sounds like she has a liberal trial lawyer willing to suck money from her to file these ridiculous lawsuits.
I think that is her in the picture.
I looked for the  thumbs up   icon to  like  your comment.
Not gonna risk it.
You need a picture of her for this article!
Seriously?
She walks around in a banana suit and sues people who take pictures of her?
Wow.
And, the judge dismissed her suit because many other people also wear banana suits and so, she can t claim a patent on it.
Does that mean there is a bunch of them around?
Couldn t resist the  banana pun-a-thon .
She may sue CapTimes for writing this story.
Good grief!

Corinne: I threw a banana peel out my car window in front of a police officer in an unmarked car, and he blocked my vehicle and made me pick it up.
He didn t seem to be interested in debating the biodegradable benefits banana peels have for the soil.
Steve: I think a lot of us have a lot of pride in how beautiful our city is.
I, for one, side with the cop.
Kris: Wow!
Cops pulling people over for tossing banana peels.
What s next?
Arresting the trees for dropping all those messy leaves?
John: I don t consider a banana peel garbage at all.
Plastic bags, cigarette butts, gum, coffee cups, fast food wrappers I can understand.
Its food for another animal.
Crows, seagulls, coons.
Its also bio degradable and good for the soil.
A banana peel is not litter in my mind.
And they ll dart out on to the road to get it.
John: You think a bird can t pick a fucking banana peel up and fly away?
Birds fly don t they, or am I mistaken?
Animals have brains to avoid traffic.
Your human ignorance amuses me.
The Secret History of Gnomes and Fairies.
Banana peels degrade in days, if not hours.
Throwing it on the street is wrong but tossing it in the bushes is not.
The point was she did it for the wrong reason.
I guarantee she had no intention on it being used for animals, birds, in protest, etc.
She did it because she is lazy and didn t want to throw it away.
I do find the whole thing ironic.
Man chugging along in his vehicle that pollutes the earth is telling the woman to pick up a biodegradable food biproduct that was once part of the earth and would do it no harm.
Frui skins and cores are good for the earth and are totally biodegradable.
TPTB like to polute the earth with radioactivity, why dont the police arrest them people?
If it was in the woods or at least on the patch of grass close to the woods off the road, I think that is ok.
Banana peels degrade in days, if not hours.
Throwing it on the street is wrong but tossing it in the bushes is not.
No one wants to smell your banana peel rotting for days.
Nor do we want the gnats and flies it will draw.
Use the proper trash recptacle or take it home to compost.
Billy Madison?

What if they started issuing $400 citations for every single cigarette butt anyone chucks?
By the way if you ve put a hot or warm one in a designated trash can attempting to dispose of it properly they can probably write you up for a couple hundred dollars for creating a fire risk.
Billy Madison?
Banana peels degrade in days, if not hours.
Throwing it on the street is wrong but tossing it in the bushes is not.
Then you have a big pile of shit compost everywhere.
Nah, screw that, make her pick it up and learn something about living in society.

You fools think a banana peel will bio-degrade in the middle of the street?
It will mold and breed flies and probably get kicked up into the undercarriage of some car.
We NEED a police state like Singapore if you people can t be educated.

Absolutely.
A heap of rotting, molding fruit waste is NOT COMPOST.
And if it were compost, you don t want it under a bush.
It gets hot enough to catch fire.
LOL!
All these fools need to be made to go pick up rotting fruit and vegetable matter for a day.
Then some organic  farmer gardener can teach them how he disposes of his plant waste and how he wants them to always use the proper trash receptacles.
Pity our cops have to be kindergarten teachers for teenagers.

If it was in the woods or at least on the patch of grass close to the woods off the road, I think that is ok.
It is not.
If she was in the woods she should carry it out with her.
That s environmentally correct.
If she throws it on a patch of grass, it will mold and draw flies and gnats.
Flies will lay eggs  maggots  and breed baby flies.
Mold is toxic to birds and small animals.
It blows up into the wind and can give people walking by an asthma attack.
The banana peel will look and smell gross breeding vermin and causing disease until some city employee picks it up,  if it does actually compost, it will kill the grass under it, leaving a brown spot.
Water will stand there, mosquitos will come, and some nature lover will get west nile virus.
But mostly, if the lazy chick flings her fruit waste out the window, some city employee has to pick up after her.
Banana peels are easily biodegradable.
And litter bugs are annoying, but freedom isn t free.
You need to try to educate and encourage people not to litter, but this sort of draconian enforcement is too much  the cure is worse than the disease .
Cops need to concentrate less on litterers and jaywalkers and more on burglars, muggers, etc.
Good thing she didn t have a dog with her.
Indeed.
She d be too lazy to walk him and drive along holding his butt out the window when he needed to go.
Poor dog.

Barney made her pick up the banana peel!
If she didn t some city employee would have to.
She s whining because it s a matter of principle.
Because ignorance can t happen again.
IQ to pull a stunt like this.
Zero Point Ltd.
Please don t bother to do this without saying what the issue is in the box above.
No issue, no action.
You ve got someone on your tail.
Could be a cop, the local bully , or a very persistent loan shark .
You could try to slow them down by shoving a banana  or potato, or similar sized object  in the tailpipe or muffler of their car.
That way, you could give yourself time to escape and have a good laugh at the victim s expense as their car sputters and churns and fails to go anywhere.
If the script calls for it, the car might even explode .
If only it worked like that in real life .
A banana or a single potato jammed into the tailpipe will probably be ejected at high speed.
Completely blocking the tailpipe of a car with something that can t simply be blown out  which can be as simple as more bananas  will smother the engine, but will not set the car on fire.
There was an episode of the Little Lulu anime where Wilbur s butler was replaced by a stricter butler who anticipated all of the tricks that Lulu and the others were going to pull on him.
Finally, they come up with a plan to work together to get rid of the mean butler.
One of the tricks involved Tubby stuffing a handkerchief in the tailpipe of the limosine, and when the mean butler checked the tailpipe, the handkerchief came loose and he wound up with a face full of smoke and soot from the tailpipe.
Messed with in one of the early issues of the comic Spy Boy , where Bombshell stops a  moving  car of bad guys by tossing what appears to be a lit cigarette into the tailpipe.
The car blows up several blocks later.
Considering that Bombshell is an explosives expert, however, it s not quite as far-fetched .
The Trope Namer here is the film Beverly Hills Cop , where Eddie Murphy s character used this technique to foil a group of bumbling police officers.
Famous for a notorious editing screwup: the banana he holds is curved, but the one in the tailpipe is straight - they couldn t fit the bent one in the tailpipe.
Filming mistakes aside, the movie does, surprisingly, play the trope more accurately than most: Axel uses multiple bananas to ensure an effective obstruction, and there is no fire or explosion.
Parodied in the  Trial of the Century  episode of Clerks: The Animated Series .
Judge Reinhold  the actor, acting as the courtroom judge  is lured away from Dante s trial by Axel Foley, who  needs  his  help!  - and they spend the evening stuffing bananas in people s tailpipes and watching them stall, but the fun ends when the local grocer reveals that he s ran out of bananas.
Then Judge Reinhold wakes up   No! Axel! Come back!  .
In the live-action version of 101 Dalmatians , raccoons put a large nut in the tailpipe of the bad guys  truck.
The pressure does shoot the nut out eventually - when the bad guy is examining the tail pipe.
In Soviet comedy Dog Paced a Piano a high school girl and her preteen sister sabotage one of engines of a cropdusting Hoodlum helicopter with a beet.
Because the older sister loves the pilot and doesn t want him to leave.
The beet does not shoot from the pipe, but the exhaust goes to the cabin instead.
The pilot lands the machine immediately after the takeoff and feels dizzy for a few minutes after.
Then the girl s Unlucky Childhood Friend surrenders himself to the police as the perpetrator, fearing that this accident may qualify as a murder attempt.
The friend still gets 15 days of community service for systematically misleading the police and being a general nuisance .
The girl joins him and helps him sweep streets, finally leaving the pilot alone.
Spud, a 2005 teen comedy novel by South African writer John van de Ruit, includes a moment where the headmaster s car is  sodomized  by a banana, and the engine explodes as a result.
The boy accused of the crime, Guy Emberton, is named after a friend of the author s; he actually said in the acknowledgments that the real Emberton  isn t really a banana vandal,  thus spoiling this scene slightly.
Something similar actually happens in Night Watch .
Except instead of a horse, it s an ox.
And instead of a banana, it s a handful of fresh ginger.
The normally law-abiding Frank of The Hardy Boys does this with a potato to the tailpipe of a police car in the Casefile book Brother Against Brother so he can steal another vehicle.
Columbo did this with a potato.
A variation was used in Pushing Daisies : the murderer shoved a potato into the tailpipe of Ned s car to fill the car with exhaust and knock out Ned and Emerson during a stakeout.
Such a thing could only happen if the exhaust system already had a leak up near the passenger compartment, which they would have noticed when the car suddenly became louder because the muffler was being bypassed.
The same was used much earlier in an episode of Ironside .
Also subverted in Minder , in which a potato was used in this manner to shoot out and smash the window of another car.
This trope also occurred in an episode of Diagnosis: Murder , this time with a wad of cash.
When the MythBusters tried this, everything they stuffed up the tailpipe shot out immediately when Jamie started the engine.
Happened in Eastenders , with a potato.
A man put it in his enemy s car s tailpipe and sniggered as the car sputtered.
He stopped laughing when the pressure ejected the potato into his shop window.
In one episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , Will mentions that some students at his old school once keyed a teacher s car and stuck a potato in the tailpipe.
His cousin Hilary hears this and is later caught rubbing a potato on her rival s car and leaving her keys in the tailpipe.
Used in an episode of Psych to stop a car thief from reaching 200 mph in a stolen car and thus getting away with murder.
Averted in favour of the more realistic option in, of all things, Glee , when Mercedes stuffs tater tots up the exhaust pipe of Sue Sylvester s Le Car and does several thousand dollars  worth of damage.
Happened in Tee Off, Mr.
Bean when the eponymous character hits a golf ball into a car s tailpipe, causing it to churn and sputter for several seconds before shooting the ball out at high speed.
MacGyver : In  A Prisoner of Conscience , Mac stalls the car of the secret police who are tailing him by sticking a potato in the exhaust pipe.
In an episode of Burn Notice note  Official Business   Season 6 , Fiona stuffs a folded woven belt  clearly shown as porous and not something that could cause a complete blockage  into the exhaust pipe of an SUV.
SUV for the next step of their plan.
In the first episode of Dad s Army , while having a discussion of how to take on a tank with improvised weapons, Jones suggests plugging the exhaust with spuds  potatoes .
Mainwarrign points out that it wouldn t work because tanks have long, thin exhaust pipes.
Jones asks why they can t use long, thin spuds.
The person to finish last would be forced to cross the border into Mexico and do a review of a Mexican supercar for an upcoming segment.
The presenters had also made unfortunate comments about said car and Mexicans in general a couple of series previously.
Since the car had enormous tailpipes, and two of them at that, they were forced to add more and larger fruits to clog it down.
Hammond removed the tailpipe fruit salad before attempting to set off, only to find they d sabotaged the car in other ways as well.
Miss Fisher s Murder Mysteries : In  Blood at the Wheel , Phyrne sabotages Jack s car by stuffing her stocking into the exhaust pipe.
In the fictional town of Lake Wobegon  as heard on A Prairie Home Companion  , everyone buys either Fords or Chevys, depending on religion.
This is mandatory.
In one case, someone who bought foreign couldn t get his car started the next day  cause someone had stuck a potato up the tailpipe.
In Tree From My Youth , Salsa is able to destroy a Pig Mask tank by shoving what is implied to be his own feces in the tailpipe.
There have been advertisements in the past for locking caps that fit over tailpipes to disable them.
Try stretching an ordinary latex balloon across the pipe.
Since it expands, it won t rocket off instantly, giving it time to smother the engine.
Then, if you ve done everything right, it will pop, making a loud noise and spooking your victim without actually causing damage to the car.
Works very well on two-stroke engines.
Good luck finding a car with one, though.
According to General Romeo Dallaire s memoir Shake Hands With the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda, some Bangladeshi UN peacekeepers sabotaged their own armored personnel carriers by sticking rags in the tailpipe so that they could avoid being sent on rescue missions in Kigali once the genocide had started.
The second case of Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney featured a car being disabled by - wait for it - a pair of panties.
MAGICAL panties.
To the relief of one and all, the person who they were stolen from  yes, stolen from  doesn t wear them; they re part of a Bag of Holding -type act.
During the course of that case, something similar happens to Klavier Gavin s motorcycle ; his bike s tailpipe gets clogged due to him using the wrong oil.
In Space Quest 5: The Next Mutation , the hero, Roger Wilco, is being stalked by a gynoid that s out to kill him for alleged mail fraud.
How does Roger Wilco save himself?
By hiding in a log, then, when the gynoid lands on top of said log, sticking a banana-like fruit in the exhaust pipe of her jet pack, causing it to explode.
In the Spider-Man game for Playstation, you have to close several smokestacks with covers, to cause an effect  like a banana in a tailpipe .
In the sillier What If?
Not in the game itself, but in a Diddy Kong Racing promo video from Nintendo Power, at one point, the host mentions someone stuffed a bag of acorns into the tailpipe of Krunch s plane, with Conker being the primary suspect.
In Jet Fighters II on iPhone, there s an unlockable Taunt called Banana Plug.
It depicts the exhaust of a jet filled with bananas.
This is the only reason DazzlingAddar can think of for the little car in Donkey Kong 64 to have a Golden Banana, though whether he thinks of the car doing this to other cars or to itself depends on the level.
In the Futurama episode  The Honking , Leela plans to kill the were-car by shoving a silver potato in its tailpipe.
Again, in  Into the Wild Green Yonder , when the Feministas sabotage a sweeper by pouring sugar in the fuel tank and shoving an organic potato  crawling with worms  in the tailpipe.
In Arthur , the family car was disabled by a toy rattle in the tailpipe.
The family only figured it out after Arthur called Car Talk .
Honorable Judge Reinhold.
The episode became a crazy patchwork of dream sequences, usually ending in a Catapult Nightmare for the character having the dream.
In Reinhold s dream, his final verdict is interrupted by Detective Axel Foley, the lead character of the Beverly Hills Cop series, bursting into the courtroom and telling  Billy  he needed his help.
Judge Reinhold played Detective William Rosewood in the Beverly Hills Cop films .
Reinhold eagerly drops his black robe and rushes to Axel s aid.
Reinhold s turn to catapult awake.
In Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?
Zack disables Carmen s flying machine by shooting an arrow into the exhaust port.
In the Family Guy episode  Viewer Mail No. 2  Point of Stew  , Stewie attempts to stuff a Twinkie in Brian s tailpipe, only to have it shot back to his face and ends up on an unexpected ride with Brian.
In American Dad!
Hayley s attempts to stop industrialists from bulldozing a forest include shoving a banana in the exhaust pipe of a bulldozer, but she s interrupted by a group of eco-terrorists who ask her to join them.
Appeared in the short-lived Ace Ventura : Pet Detective series.
In Transformers Prime , Jack and Smokescreen return from a mission together laughing their heads off.
Smokescreen asks what Jack put in his boss s exhaust pipe, and Jack responds with  Pizza .
They specifically dump fast food on people s cars as a way of circumventing the fact that they shouldn t be violently hurting people for petty reasons .
Arcee is less than impressed.
In an episode of Goof Troop , Max and PJ lie to their fathers about joining the baseball team, so they try various methods to keep them from going to the games and finding out the truth.
One of those methods is filling Pete s exhaust pipe with cement.

Herbie Goes Bananas  1980  is the fourth of a series of films made by Walt Disney Productions starring Herbie – the white Volkswagen racing Beetle with a mind of its own.
The film stars former Mel Brooks collaborators Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman .
Loosely picking up where Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo left off, protagonist Pete Stancheck   Stephen W.
Burns   has inherited Herbie from Jim Douglas, and travels to Mexico   Puerto Vallarta   with his friend Davy  D.J.  Johns   Charles Martin Smith   to retrieve the car.
There, they befriend Paco   Joaquin Garay, III  , a comically mischievous, orphaned pickpocket.
J.
Sun Princess, a cruise ship, to Rio de Janeiro to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Primeo, while Paco follows hidden in Herbie s cargo compartment.
En route they meet an anthropology student named Melissa   Elyssa Davalos   and her extravagant, eccentric aunt Louise   Cloris Leachman  , who is trying to find a husband for her niece.
When Herbie wreaks havoc on board, Pete pretends to court Melissa, intending that her Aunt Louise will sponsor their race.
Meanwhile, Herbie helps Paco, who has dubbed the car  Ocho , escape captivity.
When the ship s captain Blythe   Harvey Korman   has his costume party wrecked by the boy and car, he puts Herbie on trial and sentences him to be dropped in the sea.
However later on land, Herbie resurfaces from the water to reunite with Paco, who then goes into business with Herbie as a taxi .
Thereafter follow three villains   John Vernon , Alex Rocco , and Richard Jaeckel   seeking to capture an antique gold disc, and to find Paco as earlier he had pickpockted their wallets which contained important film by threatening to use an acetylene torch to cut up Herbie; Herbie s matador part in a bullfight; romance between Aunt Louise and Captain Blythe; and bananas initially used to conceal Herbie among farm vehicles traveling to market and later used by Herbie and Paco to stop the villains escaping justice.
Ultimately, the villains are captured, and the protagonists re-unite on the Sun Princess to celebrate.
The group enters Herbie in an upcoming race, with Paco dressed as the driver.
Davy finally asks Paco why he keeps referring to Herbie as  Ocho , since that is Spanish for eight.
Paco looks at Herbie s  53  and remarks that 5+3=8.
Mrs.
Herbie Goes Bananas met with negative reviews and is widely considered to be the weakest film in the Herbie franchise.
The prop Herbie dropped into the ocean was never retrieved.
A total of 26 VW Beetles were used, by reason of the quantity of stunts and tricks.

No, you’re not seeing things.
You really did see a Big Banana Car in downtown Dry Ridge.
Dry Ridge Auto Parts to get directions to the I-75 Camper Village where they planned to spend the night.
It was neat, it was pretty cool, I didn’t know what to think when he pulled in the driveway,” said Gary Brockman of Dry Ridge Auto Parts.
I knew it was a banana, but I couldn’t figure out why it had wheels on it.
It took Braithwaite about two and a half years from the time he had the idea to getting his fruitmobile roadworthy.
It gets about 15 miles per gallon and can keep up with traffic at 65 to 70 mph.
I thought it was crazy every single moment,” Braithwaite said.
But I’ve never been so focused on anything.
Yet, Braithwaite, who designed and built the car, has a serious motive behind his madcap capers.
T.
England,” he said.
She had an expensive experimental cancer treatment that cured her cancer, and so to celebrate, she flew to America and she spent a week in America, went back, and on the flight back she contracted a blood clot and was dead within a week.
So the whole celebration of being cancer free, ended up killing her.
According to the DVT Foundation website, about half of those with DVT, never recognize the symptoms, which include: leg pain or swelling or a leg becoming purplish or blue.
Now Braithwaite, uses his banana car as a vehicle to spread awareness about the condition.
He and his brother, Spade Braithwaite, are planning a world excursion in the car to collect donations and keep awareness at peak.
Braithwaite said his mother would have loved the Big Banana Car.
Half of any donations will go to the DVT Foundation and the other half to fund their trip around the world.
Bananas are intrinsically whimsical,” he said.
He said he got the inspiration from standing in a checkout line at a gas station.
There was a bowl of fruit right next to me,” he said.
I’d never really noticed before, but half of the bananas, instead of being that boomerang shape that you think of bananas being, half of them just curve at the back and then they run pretty straight.
So, I’m looking at one of these and thinking, that could be a vehicle.
When he brought up the idea of a round-the-world-trip in a fruit-shaped car to his brother; he was a little surprised at how calm and compliant his brother was about the idea.
It turns out, he agreed so readily, because he never in a million years thought I’d go ahead and do it,” Braithwaite said.
Braithwaite assembled a team of capable people to get the show on the road.
Liz O’Neill has the distinguished title of Crew-Knitter.
O’Neill gave Braithwaite access to her huge unoccupied workshop to assemble the car.
She has a number of duties and is in charge of marketing Big Banana Car T-shirts.
We have actually just sent our first check from T-shirt sales for $1,200 to the DVT Foundations headquarters,” O’Neill said.
I drove Bucks County Transport in Bucks County, Pa.
I heard this was happening, and I wanted to be a big part of it.
Last weekend, they attended the Banana Split Festival in Wilmington, Ohio.
Their next stop?
Cincinnati.
Greg Brockman of the auto parts store may have described the car and the team’s quest best.
It’s something different,” he said.
Police in Newington, Connecticut, are searching for a criminal mastermind, who managed to smash a convenience store door with his car and escape unscathed after stealing and eating a single banana.
Wednesday.
They found the area of the front door completely smashed in.
A review of the security camera footage showed a  Ford Freestyle station wagon with Connecticut plates backing into the door of the store repeatedly until it broke through.
Then an unidentified man, shown here, got out of the vehicle, entered the store, took one banana, peeled it, and stood there until he was done eating it.
The suspect , described as a black male in a dark jacket, wearing dark pants, and a brown hat, with or without a banana peel, then left the store and drove away.
Police have released a photo of the alleged banana lover in hopes that the public can help identify him.
Anyone with any information is urged to call Newington Police at 860-666-8445.

Sergeant Taggart : Why didn t you identify yourself as a police officer when you were arrested?
Axel Foley :  Cause I was mindin  my own business.
Hey, where the fuck do you guys get off on arresting somebody for getting thrown out of a window?
Sergeant Taggart : We have six witnesses that say you broke in and started tearing up the place, then jumped out the window!
Axel Foley : And you guys believe that?
What the fuck are you, cops or doormen?
Sergeant Taggart : We re more likely to believe an important local businessman than a foul-mouthed jerk from out of town.
Axel Foley :  Hey, man, don t square off on me with some bullshit.
Axel Foley :  Fuck you, man!
Lieutenant Bogomil :  Taggart!
I apologize for striking you.
I have no excuse.
Police Chief Hubbard : Who lured Taggart and Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a strip-tease establishment?

Axel Foley : Tell Victor that Ramon - -the fella he met about a week ago?
Ramon went to the clinic today, and I found out that I have, um, herpes simplex 10, and I think Victor should go check himself out with his physician to make sure everything is fine before things start falling off on the man.
Detective Rosewood : Wow.
You know, it says here that by the time the average American is fifty, he s got five pounds of undigested red meat in his bowels.
Sergeant Taggart : Why are you telling me this?

Detective Rosewood : Well, you eat a lot of red meat.
Axel Foley : It s the first time he s left his desk in 12 years!
Inspector Douglas Todd : At least he s had 12 years.
Anyway, it s a homicide case and it belongs to Rand.
Now go to the hospital!

Two, a professional hit.
Three, in a cop s apartment.
This whole thing stinks to high heaven!
Axel Foley : How do you know it was a professional hit?
Inspector Douglas Todd : I didn t just walk into this town from the cotton fields!
Whoever killed your friend wasn t worried about your little narrow ass.
If they were, you d be lyin  beside him in that meat wagon.
Just don t do a damn thing.
Stay out of this!
Axel Foley : Well, look.
I got some vacation time comin  to me.
I wanna take my vacation now.
Axel Foley : No, it s just that I feel I need a little vacation, that s all.
Inspector Douglas Todd :  All right.
Soon as you re finished at the hospital, you re on vacation.

Detective Foster : Yeah, and we re not gonna fall for a banana in the tailpipe.
Axel Foley :  You re not gonna fall for the banana in the tailpipe?

Axel Foley : Don t you wanna hear my side of the story?
Inspector Douglas Todd : What s your fucking side of the story?
Axel Foley : Let s hear your side of the story.
Inspector Douglas Todd : Hey Axel, I m not takin  anymore of this shit from you.
You know how much this little stunt of yours is gonna cost this city?
Axel Foley : I don t think cost is the issue here, sir.
I think the issue should be my blatant disregard for proper procedure.
Inspector Douglas Todd : You damn right, wise ass!
The mayor called the Chief, the Chief called the Deputy Chief, the Deputy Chief just chewed my ass out!
You see I don t have any bit of it left, don t you?

WASHINGTON — A trio of monkeys threw bananas and crab apples at vehicles on the main interstate highway on the East Coast and were still at large Friday, a Virginia state police spokeswoman said.
The monkeys, described by police as brownish gray, skinny and between 2 and 3 feet tall, were seen by drivers last Sunday along a stretch of Interstate 95 close to the Virginia-North Carolina border.
No one was injured, though several vehicle windows were smeared with fruit.
Sunday, according to spokeswoman Corinne Geller.
He saw what looked like a banana smeared on the rear window and when he approached the car, he found the driver with a cell phone in her hand and a strange expression on her face, Geller said.
Scott.
Interstate 95, which stretches from Maine to Florida, is known for high-speed truck traffic and lengthy areas of congestion, not for marauding monkeys.
Sure enough, a mile to the south, Scott found two more vehicles pulled to the side of the highway s northbound lanes, and a small crowd looking into the trees along the side.
They were searching for the monkeys that hit them.
Geller said.
Scott then saw the three miscreants, before they ran across the interstate.
He and another trooper pursued them, as the monkeys swung from tree to tree, she said.
But the three split up then and the troopers lost them in the underbrush.
Police suspected the monkeys had escaped from vehicles traveling to the Virginia state fair in Richmond, or to a fair across the state line in Roanoke Rapids, N.
Geller said by telephone.
Psychadelilc moon          buggies driven by a quartet of flipped-out hippie dippy mascots of madness!
What a fabulous subject for a kit!
This        little gem, along with the Archie s        Car kit , were targeted toward a younger crowd, playing the kit up        more as a toy than a hobby project.
The modular, but simple assembly, and        one-color molding are reminiscent of the sort of simple plastic toys found        on blister cards in the supermarket.
The        kit includes the proper accessories and decals to give the buggy each of        the four distinctive looks of the buggies from the TV show.
Interchangeable        driver characters all fit the vehicle, or sit on a park bench and wait their        turn.
This little gem was out only two seasons, so a quality MIB fetches an easy $150 today.
REBORN!
Come        on, you know you ve wanted to build this  little kiddie kar        kit  since you first saw it out there, but it was always priced        just a little out of reach.
Well, now you ve got your chance!
Gene,        the Genius behind the company, is a true fan of the great kits, Aurora and otherwise.
He specializes in those kits made all the more desirable        due to their rarity.
He has already done beautiful repops of many of the Monster Scenes, the Monsters of the Movies, and even Jekyll        as Hyde and Captain Kidd.
Now, lucky us, we are treated to the Banana Buggy s reincarnation!
This        baby is guaranteed to please the little glueheaded kid in all of us!
This          is a whopper of a kit!
The        kit is truly a beautiful thing.
From top to bottom, the re-mold is        excellent.
The pieces look and fit great.
All the paperwork and packaging        are quite satisfactory as well.
The very affordable price  $75  makes it        all the more agreeable.
About all one could hope for is that the plastic        color be that sickly overbright yellow.
But does anybody really want that?
First aired in 1968, The Banana Splits Show was Hanna-Barbera s        first foray into live action.
Their        slapstick interludes were interspersed by a number of ongoing series including The Arabian Knights and The Three Musketeers.
Syndicated versions        of the show, produced in 1971-72, also featured a variety of re-edited        segments and added cartoons.

There s an eye-popping new set of wheels on the road with a unique appeal.
A man in South Florida has built a car shaped like a giant banana.
Believe it or not, Steve Braithwaite said his Big Banana Car meets all road safety requirements.
The Pembroke Park man said it took him two years to build the custom car out of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.
His inspiration for the vehicle: A gas station display.
I was in a gas station, and there was a bowl of fruit right where I was standing in line.

The battle against the Banana Spaceship.
The Banana Spaceship is a vehicle in the game DK Jungle Climber .
It appears in the level Cliffy Peak .
This is exploited in the game, as Donkey Kong mistakes it for a large banana and knocks it from the sky in an attempt to eat it.
However, the spaceship fights back by shooting missiles that resemble carrots.
The only way to defeat it is by bashing the bottom of it, causing a large button to emerge.
Donkey Kong must hit the button in order to damage the ship, which is piloted by Xananab and appears to be powered by the Crystal Banana .
It was apparently built on Planet Plantaen .
At the end of the game, the Kongs use a Banana Spaceship to go back home .
What began as a battery investigation where a convenience store clerk was hit with a banana, ended with the arrest of a man after he crashed his vehicle into a natural gas line forcing the evacuation of a casino early Sunday morning, a Carson City sheriff’s deputy said.
2100 block of East Long Street after a vehicle and foot chase.
He faces felony charges of assault with a deadly weapon, reckless driving willful conduct and eluding with endangerment as well as misdemeanor charges of DUI, obstructing and hit and run.
According to the arrest report, officers were called to a convenience store in the 2700 block of Highway 50 East.
Police learned two men walked into the store and one man began using the bathroom with door opened.
The clerk told the man to close the door and the man became upset, walking out of the restroom and demanding the clerk to sell  them alcohol, the arrest report states.
One of the men threw a banana at the clerk, hitting them with it before leaving.
Deputies were able to identify the banana thrower, and knew of him being associated with a gang in the 2700 block of Menlo Drive.
Deputies arrived at the complex and learned the two men had drove up in a Lexus and parked it in the complex and went to an apartment.
Officers attempted to make contact at the apartment but there wasn’t an answer.
Officers left the area but maintained surveillance of the Lexus in which several people were standing around.
The Lexus then backed up rapidly onto Lompa Lane.
Not knowing if the Lexus had the banana throwing suspect inside, or not, the officer followed the car and then attempted to make a traffic stop at Airport Road and Gordonia.
The Lexus ignored the lights and sirens, and accelerated rapidly.
The officer lost sight of the Lexus.
Another officer located it on Woodside Drive and Airport Road.
A patrol officer attempted to catch up with the car while two other patrol vehicles were in the path of the Lexus.
The vehicle headed straight for the patrol vehicle, swerving at the last second, missing it and then moving toward another patrol vehicle, swerving at the last second.
Both Sgt.
Humphrey and Deputy Jones stated the Lexus intentionally swerved at them, missing them at the last possible moment, the arrest report states.
The Lexus, occupied by Osvaldo Ruiz, then drove at a high rate of speed onto Highway 50 from Airport Road.
A deputy saw the Lexus approaching Russell Way where it turned north without slowing down.
The Lexus drove over a raised concrete control device in the intersection of Russell Way.
A deputy then stated the Lexus went airborne after it hit a curb and sidewalk, coming to rest between the east wall of a casino in the 2200 block of East William Street and large green electrical control boxes.
The Lexus severed the meter off the natural gas line that supplies the casino.
The casino was subsequently evacuated and utility companies were called to shut down both gas and electric.
There was damage to shrubbery, an electrical box, and the exterior wall of the casino.
Meanwhile officers moved toward the car and saw Osvaldo Ruiz  jump into the back seat and then kicked open the rear passenger door and ran away northbound on Russell Way.
He continued running where he went into an apartment complex on Long Street, jumped the fence into a senior citizens apartment complex, then ran north then toward another senior complex in the 2200 block of East Long Street.
Officers found Osvaldo Ruiz hiding in a dumpster on the north end of the complex and he was arrested.
Officers smelled alcoholic beverage as he spoke and Osvaldo was slurring his words as he spoke and stumbled as he walked.
When he was asked he if had been drinking alcohol the man replied he was “f***** up,” the arrest report states.
Osvaldo Ruiz requested to be taken to the hospital for treatment and was transported there by ambulance.
A deputy followed to the hospital to continue an investigation of DUI.
It was learned Osvaldo had a prior DUI conviction in 2013.
Based on the DUI with accident, the deputy obtained a telephonic search warrant to allow for blood samples.
Ruiz was read the Nevada Implied Consent and three samples for alcohol and drugs were obtained.
He was later taken to jail.
He faces the following charges: Assault with a deadly weapon, reckless driving willful conduct, destruction of property eluding with endangerment, DUI second, obstructing and hit and run.
Bail: $68,300.

Firefighters Tony Romano, left, and Chris Nobes rescue motorists using a banana boat on Merlin Drive after their vehicle was stranded by severe flooding.
NISKAYUNA — On Wednesday, July 2, as an unexpectedly fierce summer storm raged through the Capital Region, Niskayuna firefighter Chris Nobes hurried to Merlin Drive to investigate a report of a waterlogged car with people trapped inside.
He found the vehicle and looked inside: empty.
Nobes was relieved.
He called dispatch to report what he had found and prepared to leave the area.
Just then, standing waist-deep in rainwater, he saw another vehicle approaching.
He motioned for the driver to stop.
Neighbors waved frantically.
Finally, the van came to a halt.
The engine had flooded just before crossing into a current of water flowing out of a nearby back yard.
Suddenly Nobes really did have an emergency to deal with.
At first, he thought there was just one person in the car.
As I made it closer to the vehicle, the driver identified that there was a man in there,” he said.
The second passenger was elderly and needed help walking.
Nobes, a veteran firefighter of 22 years, rapidly assessed the situation.
He was alone, and resources were spread thin due to the heavy rains.
He called for assistance from other firefighters, then enlisted the neighbors, who were watching the rescue.
You just have to use the resources that you have at hand,” Nobes said.
I knew that we had an inflatable raft that we use for ice rescue or water rescue down on the Mohawk, so that was my initial thought.
I asked neighbors if they had a raft or some sort of flotation device, because I wasn’t sure how quickly the car was going to fill with water,” he said.
They didn’t, but they did have rope, which he and the van’s able-bodied driver tied around the older passenger, just in case the vehicle started to shift.
We had to be prepared for any circumstances,” Nobes said.
Not long after, backup firefighters arrived with the enormous yellow raft, affectionately referred to as a banana boat by the rescuers.
Myself and firefighter Tony Romano assisted the gentleman out the window of the passenger side of the front door and onto the raft,” Nobes said.
There were no injuries, and the two passengers went home by a different route.
He estimates the entire rescue may have taken only 15 or 20 minutes, although he says looking at his watch wasn’t exactly top priority.
It seemed like forever, I can tell you from my standpoint,” he said.
But everyone, including Nobes himself, remained calm throughout the process.
Once I kind of determined that the water had leveled off, I knew it wasn’t a critical, critical issue,” he said.
Surprising as it may be to find oneself waist-deep in water on a normally quiet, residential street, Nobes said he hopes people will remember to be more cautious during severe storms in the future.
You definitely don’t want to go into water where you don’t know how deep it is,” Nobes said.
If there’s a current, you don’t know if the road’s still going to be there.
The road could’ve washed away, leading to sinkholes,” he added.
He said he revisited the area just an hour or two after the rescue, and the flood water had drained.
Town Supervisor Joe Landry said the town would investigate ways to prevent flooding in the area going forward.
The systems were over capacity,” he said.
Pollock confirmed that both stormwater and sanitary sewage systems had become overloaded during the intense rain.
He had already begun to informally investigate the cause of the flooding, and suggested heavy housing development was largely to blame.
Many of the flooded development areas in southeast Niskayuna, including the Avon Crest and Lisha Kill areas and Merlin Drive, were developed during a time when the prevailing wisdom was to fill in wells, ponds, and ditches to make room for impermeable structures such as homes and driveways.
The natural drainage was then replaced with pipes.
As we’ve found over the years, our pipes aren’t big enough,” Pollock said.
One solution is, of course, to simply increase pipe size.
This strategy was applied to drainage infrastructure the last time Troy Road was reconstructed.
Pollock said the pipes under that road were doubled in diameter, from 2 feet to 4 feet.
However, increasing pipe size sometimes means water moves to narrower pipes faster than the system can manage it.
You’ve just moved the problem from point A to point B,” Pollock said.
Partly because of that problem, Pollock suggested another tack the town could take to address the problem without digging up pipes.
The other way is to put in more storm water detention,” such as wells, ditches and ponds, he said.
The town will likely have help as it works to prevent flooding during the next big storm.
It’s many people’s problem, so to speak,” said Richard Pollock, Niskayuna’s superintendent of water and sewer.
He predicted the town, county, and state would all work together to decide what should be done to improve the situation in the future.

This is a sometimes true tale filled with rumors, innuendos, and just one bad dream about an actual school bus that appeared in a small Upstate New York town in the 1990’s.
Actual rating will vary with options, driving conditions, habits and vehicle condition.
With a 37+ year racing history, this 911 was originally a very early  1965-1968  short wheelbase car.
In the early 70’s the wheelbase was lengthened to 1969 long wheelbase factory specs while being converted to a race car.
Painted bright yellow, this historic Porsche was known early on in Southern California as the Electric Banana, which was painted in blue lettering on the back panel.
In the early to mid 70’s the car was raced in SCCA and other regional California Sports Car Club events, mostly at Riverside International Raceway, Willow Springs & Sears Point.
Log books  as issued by the California Sports Car Club  go back to 1976 and remain with the car today.
It was originally modified to SCCA C Production racing specs.
It continued to be raced in SCCA C Production and B Sedan with an upgraded engine and brakes.
During that time period, it was more extensively modified closer to 911ST style and Group 3 & 4 FIA GT specs with slightly wider fenders to accommodate wider 7”& 8” wheels.
In order to compete in SCCA B Production, IMSA GT & Trans-Am races, modifications again took place in the mid to late 70’s.
Brakes and suspension components were upgraded to GCR’s in effect at the time.
7L, along with wider RSR style 8” front & 10” rear fender flares and an RS & RSR style rear wing.
During that time, the #31 Porsche continued to be campaigned as the Electric Banana” in Southern California at Riverside, Laguna Seca, Willow Springs & Sears Point with various local drivers.
In July 1979, the Electric Banana  #31 was last raced by its owners  International Racing Services of California  at Riverside.
It was then sold to its new owner in August of 1979.
9L engine and 8” & 10” Centerline wheels.
That period picture  taken in 1975  remains in the original log book today.
During the 1979 season, the car was entered in numerous regional and national SCCA & IMSA races competing mostly at Seattle International Raceway, Portland International Raceway and Sears Point.
During the 1980 season  prior to further modifications  a B Improved Production track record was set at PIR under the sanctioning of CSCC.
2L engine.
It was entered in SCCA, Trans-Am & IMSA races by several drivers from the West Coast, generally qualifying & finishing in the top 15.
As with most racecars, modifications & improvements continued to new SCCA, Trans-Am & IMSA general competition rules at the time.
The car’s improvements received its technical inspection from both SCCA Pro Racing, IMSA & regional stewards.
In 1980 the roll cage was “drilled & stamped” by SCCA Pro Racing in order to compete in the 1980 PIR SCCA CRC Chemicals Trans-Am race.
A 10 minute 16mm film featuring this car  with in car, trackside & Aerial cameras  was made during this race.
From 1980 until 1983 the car was entered in numerous regional and national SCCA, Trans-Am & IMSA races on the West Coast.
It was continually modified according to the ever changing racing specs of the time.
During that time, it was painted yellow with red & black accents.
Records show it was entered as a Porsche 911, a 911RSR & 911SC and a Carrera.
Prior to being sold again, it was entered at SIR in the 1983 Trans-Am race where it finished 7th overall.
The car was sold to its fourth owners and raced in both regional and national SCCA Regional, Trans-Am & IMSA by several other drivers until 1986 when it went into storage.
In 1989 the car was sold again, restored  and repainted white with blue & green strips  to its 1970’s period 911RSR or ST configuration and raced in selected vintage races in Oregon, Washington & California until around 1994.
It was then restored to earlier 911 SCCA B Sedan & C Production configurations.
It was minimally raced between 1994 & 1998.
It was then sold to its sixth owner who entered the car in several local vintage races until 2007.
In 2007 a documented full “nut & bolt” professional restoration took place, taking the car back to its SCCA B Production, B Sedan & early Trans-Am style configuration as it was raced in the day.
The craftsmanship and attention to detail is truly spectacular.
The was entered and accepted for the 2009 Monterey Historic Automobile races.
While under the care of Canepa Design the Electric Banana underwent a complete race prep and engine rebuild.
5:1 compression race engine.
This potent motor was dynoed at 301hp and 250 ft lbs of torque.
While the motor was out the transmission’s gears were shortened to better suit the car’s power on road courses such as Laguna Seca.
The Electric Banana’s suspension currently features period correct coil-over suspension, 930 brakes, and 8” Minilites on the front and 9” Minilites on the rear shod with Avon racing tires.
Inside you will find a pair of Sparco Evo race seats, Schroth Profi Style Cam-Lock Harnesses, an auxiliary fire extinguisher, and SFI roll cage padding.

Feeling peckish?
A hungry criminal smashed his car through the front doors of a petrol station just so he could steal a banana.
The fruit fiend repeatedly backed his Ford Freestyle SUV into the doors of Citgo station in Newington, Connecticut, before breaking the glass, getting out of his vehicle and taking a banana off a shelf.
He then stood in front of the CCTV, making no effort to hide his face, and began peeling and eating the stolen banana.
The break-in set off the station’s alarm, alerting the police, but the man had time to carry out his strange crime and make a swift exit.
The suspect, identified as a black male wearing a dark jacket, dark pants, and a brown hat, then entered the store.
The suspect selected a banana from a shelf, peeled and ate the fruit, and then exited the store.
Banana Birds  scientific name: Bananus Goldus Flutterus  are birds that are, strangely, made out of partially peeled bananas .
They play a very important part in the game Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong s Double Trouble!

They are found in secret caves in the Northern Kremisphere , where a  Simon Says  like memory game with four colored crystals was played to obtain a bird and free it from its crystal prison.
All except four could be found using Funky s ordinary rental vehicles, but to get 103%, Kiddy and Dixie Kong had to obtain all the DK Coins from Koin in each level, give them to Funky, and obtain the Gyrocopter .
Using this new vehicle, they were able to access the last three caves and give all the Banana Birds to Wrinkly Kong .
When Kiddy and Dixie visited Wrinkly after collecting all the Birds, the little creatures grabbed the two and carried them to their mother , a big Banana Bird living in the clouds.

Peel Out in a Banana Car!
Above is an actual picture I snapped at my local dealership today.
Cool idea.
As I write, I’m sitting in the waiting area having taken my car in for service.
The dealer principal tells me the idea of putting out fruit came from his wife.
She didn’t like donuts.
In this vein,  I would encourage you to look at your dealership operations through your customers’ eyes   Visit your stores, go into competitive dealerships, see what they’re doing – all with the intent of looking through new eyes as to what your customers are actually experiencing.
One practical note.
Be careful what your people are saying behind the service counter or walking across the showroom floor.
So far I’ve heard about a ‘difficult’ customer in a less than flattering tone, a technician who was harshly told that he performed something wrong, and a problem that occurred when a customer took delivery of their new car.
I really shouldn’t hear this stuff.
It doesn’t just happen at car dealerships.
I regularly fly into Windsor airport on the way to Detroit and it’s amazing what people talk about very openly  and loudly  in the lounge area waiting for their plane.
It’s  interesting what you can pick up in the way of competitive intelligence.
Sticking with the theme of looking for new ideas to improve the customer experience, in a posting last month I wrote about the vehicle delivery tower at the Autostadt in Wolfsburg , Germany.
This is the facility that delivers between 400 and 500 vehicles per day.
I mentioned it because it makes the delivery experience stand out for customers, something which we know statistically can increase overall customer satisfaction.
Even though a ‘regular’ dealership wouldn’t be able to afford something like that, I was sent a posting by a colleague in our UK office that is worth sharing.
If you go to the top of the posting, it shows a customer video that captures their new car being brought up through the showroom floor on a lift.
Take a look at the comments.
Looks like it plays well and customers tell customers.
Until next time.
Yea, I agreed with you.
Making customer feel that they are ‘special’ and respected is very important to ensure continuously the business is growing.
A bad customer service or experience will leave the customer  visiting you for the last time.
From a reputation management standpoint, your employees are ambassadors of your brand.
They need to be trained and reminded that the customer is the reason THEY ARE BEING PAID.
Thanks for the insights!

ANAHEIM, March 27, 2011 â€” Your next new car hopefully wonâ€™t be a lemon.
But it could be a pineapple or a banana.
Thatâ€™s because scientists in Brazil have developed a more effective way to use fibers from these and other plants in a new generation of automotive plastics that are stronger, lighter, and more eco-friendly than plastics now in use.
They described the work, which could lead to stronger, lighter, and more sustainable materials for cars and other products, here today at the 241st National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society  ACS .
Some of these so-called nano-cellulose fibers are almost as stiff as Kevlar, the renowned super-strong material used in armor and bulletproof vests.
Unlike Kevlar and other traditional plastics, which are made from petroleum or natural gas, nano-cellulose fibers are completely renewable.
The properties of these plastics are incredible,â€� LeÃ£o said, â€œThey are light, but very strong â€” 30 per cent lighter and 3-to-4 times stronger.
We believe that a lot of car parts, including dashboards, bumpers, side panels, will be made of nano-sized fruit fibers in the future.
Besides weight reduction, nano-cellulose reinforced plastics have mechanical advantages over conventional automotive plastics, LeÃ£o added.
These include greater resistance to damage from heat, spilled gasoline, water, and oxygen.
With automobile manufacturers already testing nano-cellulose-reinforced plastics, with promising results, he predicted they would be used within two years.
Cellulose is the main material that makes up the wood in trees and other parts of plants.
Its ordinary-size fibers have been used for centuries to make paper, extracted from wood that is ground up and processed.
In more recent years, scientists have discovered that intensive processing of wood releases ultra-small, or â€œnanoâ€� cellulose fibers, so tiny that 50,000 could fit inside across the width of a single strand of human hair.
Like fibers made from glass, carbon, and other materials, nano-cellulose fibers can be added to raw material used to make plastics, producing reinforced plastics that are stronger and more durable.
LeÃ£o said that pineapple leaves and stems, rather than wood, may be the most promising source for nano-cellulose.
He is with Sao Paulo State University in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Another is curaua, a plant related to pineapple that is cultivated in South America.
Other good sources include bananas; coir fibers found in coconut shells; typha, or â€œcattails;â€� sisal fibers produced from the agave plant; and fique, another plant related to pineapples.
To prepare the nano-fibers, the scientists insert the leaves and stems of pineapples or other plants into a device similar to a pressure cooker.
They then add certain chemicals to the plants and heat the mixture over several cycles, producing a fine material that resembles talcum powder.
The process is costly, but it takes just one pound of nano-cellulose to produce 100 pounds of super-strong, lightweight plastic, the scientists said.
So far, weâ€™re focusing on replacing automotive plastics,â€� said LeÃ£o.

Roadside vendors did not have the expected sale for Ayudha Pooja this year, as unsold banana trees and pumpkins were found abandoned alongside the busy roads in Namakkal on Wednesday.
While they were found abandoned in many places across the town, dozens of pumpkins that had been heaped alongside the busy Mohanur Road and Paramathi Road hindered vehicle movement.
In addition to the drizzling that kept the roads wet and slippery, it was very difficult for two-wheeler riders as they had to avoid the slippery banana leaves that occupied a major portion of the road near the Namakkal Bus Stand.
By afternoon conservancy workers and roadside dwellers picked up the pumpkins, but they were not interested in the small banana plants.
Conservancy workers in the municipality cleared the garbage close to the heaps of banana plants, but they left these plants untouched as they would have to pull several loads of their handcarts filled with the leftovers to clear the entire road.
Road users said that police and the local body officials should ensure that such shops – which mushroom for the one-day sale – are not put up near the junctions and narrow roads.

Very helpful and willing to chat if they aren t busy.

I went  here to get a rack for my truck bed for my paddleboards today.
They come in a set but they are nice enough to split it and just sell you half at half the price too which was all I needed too.
00 extra for them to install it too beacuse I m lazy like that.
Customer service was excellent on the phone and in the shop.
I could be wrong but I think his name was glenn that installed it and did an awesome job too.
The rack is cherry.
Nice and wide but not too wide.
I wouldn t doubt I could fit my boards and my one man canoe on It too.
Something I couldn t do with the other ones that got stolen.
These Thule 500 racks come with a lifetime warranty too which makes this rack worth every penny.
I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for racks, new or used kayaks, paddles leashes.
When it was time to buy truck racks, a friend recommended Go Bananas on Kapahulu.
When I walked through the front door, I found a toy store for everyone involved in water-sports.
Customer service was attentive, friendly, helpful and informative.
Aaron offered rack options, he and Blake installed them when all the components arrived.
Although installation was somewhat challenging, they were patient, totally professional, read the instructions to insure the roof rack was in the correct spot and even measured the location several times to confirm their work.
Since the roof racks were installed, Ive returned to the store several times to make additional purchases and exchange items, and had excellent customer service every time.
The staff at Go Bananas has been a experience that added to my entry into watersports that I appreciate.

It was a long week at work, but Friday had finally come.
I EARNED this weekend, I thought to myself, so no better way than to relax in the middle of the ocean in a kayak to call my own.
Ok, maybe it wasn t MY kayak, but the kind they rent out at Go Bananas was just as good!
Kayaking, like many other things recently, is a new hobby.
Having done it just a handful of times at other places where the shop is close to the beach, it was getting expensive.
I also wanted to take the kayak out to other places I was yet to explore, so renting a kayak I could put on top of my car would be the best bet.
Go Bananas allows the flexibility to take the kayak where ever you want to and so much more!
Only $30 for a one-day rental, they provide you with EVERYTHING you need to get you going.
EVERYTHING!
Other places tend to charge everything seperately  why would you charge for the seat?
They walk you through step-by-step on how to safely secure the kayak to your car, leaving very little room for error when you re by yourself on the way back.
This all lead up to an awesome day kayaking around Chinaman s Hat and Go Bananas made it so easy to do so.
A 9am-6pm rental is super flexible and again, you can t beat the price.

RENTING THE KAYAK: Two friends and I walked into the store right when it opened and asked to rent a three-person kayak.
I just got a 2013 iDcard and wanted to use it at Go Bananas to receive 20% off.
Once they confirmed with us that we wanted a three-person kayak and such, we were asked to read the liability form and sign and initial.
1  If you rent a kayak for a day  9am to 6pm  like we did, you must return the kayak before 6pm or you will be penalized with a $15 late fee.
2  You lose anything, you buy.
They have your credit card number from the forms you fill out.
3  It s your life on the line and Go Bananas is not liable for you dying.
After the official documentation, we were given a tutorial on how to set up the kayak and how to secure the kayak on the vehicle.
We were also given advice on how to kayak to our destination based on the current and weather forecast.
We re newbies when it comes to kayaking and we had no difficulty thanks to their tutorial so it shouldn t be too difficult to bring a kayak back safe and undamaged.
Kayak rentals also come with racks to carry the kayak s  on your vehicle, paddles, paddle leashes, life jackets  PFD s , backrests, dry bags, and gear bags upon request.
We asked for a second dry bag for our valuables and it was given to us free of charge.
We fell into the water a number of times while trying to kayak to Mokulua Island and everything we had was still dry and undamaged by the time we actually reached the island.
I m with is completely new to kayaking.
We kept falling and getting hurt because the waves were being mean and the current kept pulling us away from our destination.
There were people both on the beaches and in the water who helped us get back on track and I can t thank them enough.
They basically saved our lives!
Also, don t go kayaking with somebody you re in a relationship with.
If you re both new to kayaking and you attempt to kayak, you ll end up arguing and bitching at each other all day.
We also heard that three-person kayaking is harder than two-person kayaking because synchronization is more difficult.
ANOTHER TIP: Practice your salsa hip coordination and synchronization before you go kayaking.
Apparently it s good practice before kayaking.
AFTER: About 30 minutes after we returned the kayak and equipment on time, I got a call saying that they forgot to grab the paddle leashes from my car and that I needed to return them.
By the time I got the message we were already sitting inside of a restaurant and there was no way that I could return their equipment before their 7pm closing time.
They said I could return it the next day if I had the chance and I said that I was fine with that.
I returned the next day and returned the paddle leashes without being penalized  which shouldn t happen anyway because it wasn t my fault .
I m happy to have rented from Go Bananas because of their great customer service and advice.

I ve been very pleased with the very friendly, competent, professional, and helpful service provided by Go Bananas.
I highly recommend them if you re looking for anything kayak related  sales or rentals .
They have two locations - one in Honolulu, and one over in Aiea not far from the Pearl Ridge Mall.
The Aiea location is sort of a satellite store and doesn t  have ALL the stuff that the main store has.
However, I ve been to both locations and was equally pleased with the friendly and professional service I received.
As an active duty service member, I could opt to go rent kayaks from the outdoor recreation place on base.
I would RATHER go to Go Bananas though.
The prices were comparable, but the service was 100 times better at Go Bananas.
Going on base didn t save me enough money to give up the good service.
Before we moved to Hawaii, I was not an experienced kayaker.
I had only gone a couple of times in my life.
I wanted to try it with my six year old son, but I wasn t sure if I could handle the boat by myself with him just as a passenger.
The staff at Go Bananas were very supportive, encouraging, and helpful in telling me that I could do it and giving me pointers how to get started.
The first time I took my son kayaking, we just rented a kayak from the Navy and paddled around Pearl Harbor for an hour to see how my son like it.
He and I both enjoyed it, so we decided to try a longer trip.
The second time we went kayaking, we rented a kayak from the Go Bananas in Aiea.
They were super helpful in getting the kayak on top of the car and strapped down and explaining the gear and giving pointers on how to use it.
My son and I drove over to the windward side to the Kualoa Regional Park and paddled out around Chinaman s Hat and back again.
We had a blast.
We subsequently went to the Honolulu location because they had a wider variety of kayaks available there, and the owner allowed us to rent different kayaks to try them out and then apply our rental fees toward buying a new kayak.
If you re interested in trying out a kayak, then I highly recommend Go Bananas.
Got a great deal for 2 for 1 rental of SUP over two days.
Everything about the process from rental to return was easy going and go with the flow.
Prices were fair for the convenience and location.
Service was friendly and professional.
The only drawback is that they could stand to take better care of their equipment or rotate out the older inventory.
We had some nice rentals, but I was kinda sorta looking forward to a better selection of SUPs.

My boyfriend was visiting me in October,  and although he has visited Oahu numerous times in the past he had never gone kayaking before and neither have I.
One of my best friends had told me she kayaked to Chinaman s hat and hiked up the small mountain.
I immediately knew that would be something my boyfriend would enjoy, she suggested I check out Go Bananas and that I did.
We learned that they were pretty affordable, at $45 for a double hull from the hours 9-6pm.
At first I thought that wouldn t be enough time, but we made it work.
When we went to pick up the kayak the guy there was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly.
He answered all of our questions, gave us great tis, and suggest other places we can kayak.
The fee comes with every thing you need to store the kayak on your vehicle, a dry bag for your stuff, and life vests.
My boyfriend and I had a really great time kayaking, we are actually planning to kayak again on our upcoming trip back home.
We hope to spend more time  kayaking and enjoying the ocean.
We would highly recommend Go Bananas for any water sport activity and kayaking!
Very rude, no sympathy at all.
And I just spent over $500 with them a few days before.

5 18 2012 We have a very busy store selling and renting kayaks and SUP Boards and selling and installing roof… We have a very busy store selling and renting kayaks and SUP Boards and selling and installing roof racks and truck racks and we don t always have the time to ask our customers why they are buying an item or how they plan to use it.
Customers should always read their instructions fully before using the product they purchased.
We installed his roof racks but he installed the Strap Thang separately.
He returned a couple of days later very angry because his new SUP Board had blown off of his car because the rubber band on the Strap Thang broke and he wanted us to repair or replace his New SUP Board  $1000-$1800 .
SUP Boards.
There s only so much a rubber cord can take.
I mentioned I thought he was using the wrong equipment and rack straps would have worked better.
Unfortunately this only made him madder.
I told him the manufacturer would replace his broken strap but they wouldn t repair or replace his equipment.
I could have replaced his rubber cord had he asked for that but he was looking more for service to his damaged board.
We carry and sell the Strap Thang because some of our customers insist on buying them for short and long surfboards because they are a quick and easy way to tie surfboards on to the Yakima roof rack.
With SUP Boards being as big as they are I would always recommend rack straps because they are stronger, have no stretch, and fit over larger loads but I can t force my customers to buy one item if they want another.
While I feel sorry for this customer and I would be happy to give him a full refund for his Strap Thang I don t feel responsible for how he used the equipment nor the repair or replacement of his SUP Board.
For any other customers or people who want to tie equipment to the top of their cars and trucks please keep in mind that webbing straps are much stronger than bungee cords or the solid rubber cord found on the Strap Thang, they don t stretch, and they don t require knots like rope.
You  the driver  are ultimately responsible for tying your load to your car and you will be held accountable for any accidents caused if your load comes off of your car while you are driving.
I found this place by store locator from the Vibram shoes website.
So I went this place to buy a Vibram fivefinger shoes for running but they do not carry the running shoes.
However, they do carry Vibram shoes for water front or water sports.
After struggling to try to fit their on hand stock to my foot, we found that the size did not fit my small feet.
The owner , old lady, was kind enough to teach me the other stores near by.
The service was good and I felt very comfortable.

Shopped for surf racks for my truck and was happy to find try had all the components I need.
The guy helping me was nice enough, and certainly knows his stuff.
However, his candor left something to be desired.
I came back a few days later to exchange a part I didn t need for some other product and well, it was even less friendly than my first visit.
This is the only place on Oahu to grab the best rack components at a fair price, but do be mindful, you might be treated like garbage.

We ve bought four kayaks and all of our accessories including our roof racks, straps and pads from here.
They are super helpful and knowledgeable and the prices aren t bad either.
However, I don t recommend buying things from their online shop.
Prices can be a bit tricky.
It s better to go down to the store or call to get a quote.
We thought that the truck racks were $199 for both front and back, but found out that it was $199 for just one set by calling the store.
Other than that, I d recommend coming here for all your kayak needs!

Cheap, friendly, hassle free, and convenient rentals.
We took 2 SUPs for the day and it was outrageously easy.

Definitely recommend this place!

These guys know Kayaks!
I wanted to buy a Kayak to surf with.
I could not decide between 2 different models.
The owner, and the other people I talked to on the floor were extremely helpful in helping me make the right decision.
They had a lot of firsthand experience with both models, so they really know their Kayaks and could really give great advice.
I am very satisfied as their experience helped me choose the right Kayak for my needs.
Also, I was impressed when I first called on the phone at how much time the owner spent with me answering questions.
He never sounded rushed and I always felt comfortable.
I also liked that they customized the Kayak with their recommendations, and that was really valuable.
Because they use what they sell, they know what makes for a better Kayak, and they made several important and extremely helpful additions to my Kayak.
After my purchase I had one additional question and the owner promptly responded to my Email.
I am a very happy customer.

We ll be back again soon!

My husband just recently got into paddling.
He was strapping his 17  board to the top of his truck with bungee cords and foam pieces.
He s usually really good at MacGyver-ing things from whatever we have at home, but I have to put my foot down when it comes to safety.
I offered to buy him a rack system for his birthday and he took me up on the offer.
We didn t really know where to go so we figured we d head down to Sports Authority.
Kaimuki anyway we decided to stop in.
So glad we did!
I didn t get the name of the guy who helped us, but he was awesome, super easy-going.
He made suggestions, gave us a few different options for racks, and provided us with lot of information.
Very, very knowledgeable.
Another cool thing, they re opened almost every day of the year and their hours are very convenient.
I d highly suggest checking this place out.
Also, if you re going to purchase or rent something here, you might want to pick up an Isle Discount Card, you might benefit from their participation with the program.

I had a great experience renting a pair of kayaks from Go Bananas.
The staff were super knowledgeable and helpful for a novice like myself.
They taught us how to rig the kayaks up to the top of our car and supplied us the gear to do so.
The kayaks were in great shape and we had a wonderful time taking them out on Kaneohe Bay.
The guy who checked our gear back in was super friendly and gave me some tips on other places to check out next time we go kayaking.
When it comes time for me to buy a kayak, I will definitely give them the first shot at my business.
I also must say, the pricing was very reasonable as compared to other watersports rental places in the area.
I d recommend Go Bananas highly to anyone wanting to rent a kayak!

When I told the salesman, John, what it was that I was looking for and asked that he either see if they have it in stock or if they could get it from their Aiea store, he responded,  Well do you just want to come in?   I said that I would go in if they had the product but didn t want to make the trip otherwise.
He further responded,  Actually, I m trying to eat my lunch right now.  Could you call back in about 10 minutes?   Great service.
Remind me never to shot there again.

They revolutionized kayaking for beginners and experts alike and Hawaii was the perfect place for them with her warm waters, tranquil setting, and wonderful surf.
Because of our love of these new kayaks we instantly became one of the worlds leading dealerships using these kayaks for surfing, camping, fishing, freediving, scuba diving, and even sailing.
We have singles, doubles, triples, and larger kayaks in our fleet.
We sell Ocean Kayak, Cobra Kayaks, Malibu Kayaks, Epic Kayaks, Wave Witch, Infinity, etc.

Not only paddling but everything you can do from a kayak including surfing, camping, fishing, scuba diving, and sailing.
I got to see the birth of OC1 and OC2 as well as SUP Paddling.
I still need to learn how to fish for the big fish  Ono, Mahimahi, and Marlin  as well as freedive from my kayaks.
I am also raising my 3 daughters to love the ocean and paddling as much as I love it!
They ve all had their own kayaks since they were 5.
Kailua beach is beautiful and the tour was perfectly structured.

Peel your banana, then cut up into small pieces  about 16 pieces per banana .
Put it in your freezer and allow to freeze.
Once frozen blend your banana with your milk.
Get it smooth.
Add your berries and pineapple.
Blend until everything is smooth.
Pour and enjoy!
Try other fruit variations.
Do you know how much I love bananas?
I usually eat 2 bananas a day.
But sometimes by the time I get to the last one, it’s brown and very ripe.
I don’t like super gooey brown bananas raw, so this smoothie is perfect for it.
I cut it in half then cut into equal sized slices.
Then I throw them in a bag and freeze.
Strawberries are delicious.
I spotted our first strawberry flowers a few days ago.
I can’t wait to harvest our own strawberries this year.
They’re always super sweet.
One happy blender!
Enjoy your smoothie, hope you like it!
Do you have any other fruit variations to share?
Please do!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
Lovely & refreshing too!
I’d so add coconut milk to this, not very healthy but i’m on a coconut kick atm!
I also love adding a little shaved coconut into my smoothies !

These speaker connectors, are s high quality with an incredible finish.
In addition, it has a few screws for adjuster cables of the loudspeakers.
I m a fan of digital audio.
Good connectors, however, I don t recommend them when matched with Audioquest X-2 speaker wire.
The insulation on the Audioquest speaker wire is too thick to fit these connectors.
These plugs look nice and sort of hi-end.
They come in a small plastice slip that fits in an envelop with no branding, elaborate instructions or micro tools.
I have read that everyone who knows anything about electronics uses bananas, so will convert my other speakers when I can to.
2 of 3 important things with a little product like this came through with flying colors.
The major disadvantage was actually placing it on the speaker wire.
The wire seemed to big to fit inside the plug and then wraparound with the use of a micro screwdriver  which I don t have  to tighten the wire in place.
I had to shove it in there to I noticed some hold and tape it a little with electric tape.

Petersburg Assembly members voted, with a few caveats, to express their support to the state for a new ferry service to land in the borough.
Despite earlier alternatives offered, the North End Ferry Authority  NEFA  had circled back to Banana Point, submitting a letter requesting the borough’s support of the location to get the project on track to begin carrying passengers in May of 2015.
The letter, signed by NEFA Manager Kent Miller, included copies of its land use permits applications to the Department of Natural Resources  DNR , the primary agency which controls the site.
But the docking, contested by many users of the recreational site, will only be temporary, to be re-examined by DNR officials and NEFA’s board after a year, eventually to switch over to using another site, Miller added.
The only letter the Assembly sent out was to ask you to steer away from Banana Point, if you could,” Mayor Mark Jensen pointed out, recalling previous objections from recreational users of the launch who were concerned that allowing the ferry to dock at the site could crowd out recreational users or significantly damage the concrete launch ramp through direct contact or propeller scouring.
According to a letter submitted to the Assembly, the other proposed locations had proved ultimately unsuitable for a variety of reasons.
S.
Forest Service, was rejected based on its continued usage for timber products.
I still have reservations in the success of doing it out there, but, again, I think you’ve tried your best to accommodate everybody and hope for your success,” Assembly Member John Havrilek said.
Miller added that NEFA had approached the Alaska Department of Transportation about possibly splitting the cost of modifying the terminal between the agencies, about $260,000 by ADOT and the slightly larger portion by NEFA, but the idea had not met with approval.
DOT instead proposed to offer their support for our interim use of the Banana Point launch ramp.
Addressing another major concern expressed by residents, Miller also stated that NEFA had obtained an engineering opinion from Michael Lukshin of ADOT’s division of harbors that the landing craft’s use of Banana Point would not significantly damage the ramp.
His statement is, in a nutshell, ‘in our opinion, NEFA’s proposed use of the launch ramp should have relatively minor impact on the structural integrity of the facility and that excessive wear or damage will not be incurred under normal use conditions, and if diligent care and attention is taken by vessel operators,” he said.
The cement ramp being significantly higher on the Mohs scale, Miller added that the ferry’s loading ramp would be padded by extra-dense polymer skids to prevent it and the landing area from damage during docking.
About 10 percent of the total displacement of the boat will come to bear on the ramp in two hulls, it’s a catamaran craft,” Miller said, citing engineering specs that estimate the ferry to be operating between weights of 50-90 tons.
That’s less than the typical wheel load of a highway vehicle.
NEFA engineers had looked at the depth for the launching ramp and area water turbulence and did not anticipate any major damage from scouring, he said.
Additionally, NEFA would be liable for damages to the ramp during its use, he said, mentioning a $50,000 cash escrow and insurance policy that would be in place to cover repairs to the site.
The facility is appraised by the State Engineer’s Office at about $250,000.
Assembly Member Kurt Wohlhueter asked Miller who would be “diligently overseeing that, so, if damages occurred, we’re compensated” — and if the borough is required to pick up the additional burden of monitoring the site, who will pay for the staff hours?
It’s not like anybody’s going to go out there and watch you make the landings,” Wohlhueter said.
Jensen and Public Works Director Karl Hagerman speculated that the site would likely police itself, with frequent users passing word of any damages to Hagerman in fairly short order.
Yet should borough staff have to put in additional hours on the site in relation to the ferry’s usage, be it inspections or cleaning, Miller said NEFA would, depending on circumstance, likely reimburse the borough.
We have said, if any work is required, we’re going to pay for it,” Miller said.
You can be sure you’re going to get a prompt response, and we’re not proposing there be an investigation and determination of fault before our response kicks in — we’re going to take the responsibility.
Later projects and grants also had not ruled out the possibility of the site taking on additional uses for transportation, he added.
The ferry to make the runs, the M V Silver Eagle, a 65-foot landing craft, would be renamed “Rainforest Islander” and will carry 28 passengers, seven vehicles and cargo, stopping twice each day at Banana Point.
Those not taking vehicles to the craft will be “shuttled on off the ferry by an 11-passenger van, which also will transport passengers to from Petersburg,” according to the application.
Initial usage numbers are estimated at 5,200 passengers and 1,600 vehicles, expected to rise to 6,200 passengers and 1,900 vehicles by 2018.
It will not stop for fuel in Petersburg, but may load and purchase supplies from businesses in the borough.
Additionally, NEFA’s land use application proposed limited site development for parking and ferry loading operations.

About: Without Alex, there would be no Banana Stand.
With a post production credits list approaching 20 live records, Alex has been essential to the development of Banana Stand.

We ve found him to be a skilled producer, guitarist, bassist, keyboardist, lyricist, singer, and a gentleman.

None exceed his passion.

We re lucky he did -- they re two of our favorites.

His space, experience, and ethic were all inspiring.

We rapidly became fans both of his new band, and his production aesthetic -- surprisingly, the bulk of the Log Across the Washer is self-produced.

We look forward to more from Tyler, both as an artist and as a producer.
