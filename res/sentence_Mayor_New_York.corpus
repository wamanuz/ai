Mayors were appointed by provincial governors until 1777 when a Council of Appointment was formed by New York State.
In 1821 the New York City Council – then known as the Common Council – began appointing mayors.
Although being Mayor of New York City has been described as the  second toughest job in America  after the Presidency ,  and although several mayors – most recently John Lindsay and Rudolph Giuliani – have sought the Presidency, no one person has yet held both positions.
Indeed no sitting or former mayor has been elected to another public office since Ardolph Loges Kline  acting mayor in late 1913  was re-elected Alderman in 1913 and later elected in 1920 to his only term in Congress.

Mayor Bill de Blasio is the 109th Mayor of New York City.
From his early days as a young City Hall staffer, to serving on his local school board, to his most recent position as Public Advocate for the City of New York, Bill de Blasio has spent his life fighting to ensure that every New Yorker - in every neighborhood throughout our five boroughs - gets a fair shot.

City of New York.
Columbia University Law School and chief judge                        of the city court, Van Wyck rose through the ranks of Tammany                        Hall to become the first mayor of Greater New York after                        consolidation.
In 1897, he fought a bitter campaign against                        political reformer and one time Brooklyn Mayor Seth Low.
As a crowd of spectators                          3,000 strong anxiously awaited his remarks outside City                          Hall, the new mayor uttered just two sentences.
Manhattan                          Mayor William Strong offered his congratulations, to which Van Wyck replied:  Mr.
Mayor, the people have chosen me                          to be mayor.
Van Wyck s tenure as mayor was                          beset by administrative failures and political scandals,                          including charges he participated in an Ice Trust scam                          that artificially inflated the price of fresh milk.
In                          1899, the state legislature conducted an investigation                          into corruption in New York City, and concluded Van Wyck                          was a  dictator  who had  abdicated  his powers to the                          Tammany Hall bosses.
Perhaps his greatest accomplishment                          as mayor was the awarding of the city s first subway contract,                          valued at $35,000,000.
Upon                          his death, The New York Times remarked:  Van Wyck became                          involved in probably more scandals than any mayor in the                          city s history.
Wyck s unremarkable tenure as the first mayor of Greater                        New York rejuvenated the reform movement and paved the way                        for Seth Low.
A graduate and president of Columbia University,                        former Mayor of Brooklyn and life-long activist in progressive                        politics, Low was the first mayor to be elected on a fusion                        ticket with the backing of the Republican and Citizens Union                        parties.
Low died on September 17, 1916                        at his upstate New York home.
McClellan                        was a graduate of Princeton University, a journalist, an                        attorney, a congressman by twenty-seven, and by thirty,                        president of the New York City Board of Aldermen .
Christian Brothers order, William Jay                        Gaynor would disappoint Tammany Hall when they nominated                        him for mayor in 1909.
Elected                        to the New York Supreme Court in 1893, and appointed to                        the Appellate Division, Second Department in 1905, Gaynor s                        rulings were often cited around the country.
His reputation                        as an honest reformer helped win him election as mayor in                        1909.
On January 1, 1910, he walked                          to City Hall from his home in Brooklyn  it was the                          first time he had ever visited the seat of city government  and addressed the 1,500 people gathered to greet                          him: I enter upon this office with the intention of doing                          the very best I can for the City of New York.
As mayor, he railed against efforts to thwart                          the further development of the New York City subway system.
A strong willed but compassionate mayor, Gaynor once remarked,                           The world does not grow better by force or by the policeman s                          club.
Early in his first term, Gaynor was shot in the                          throat by a discharged city employee, the only New York                          City mayor to suffer an assassination attempt.
During his term as mayor,                          Gaynor was widely considered a strong candidate for Governor                          or President.
John Purroy Mitchel was the youngest                        person ever to be elected Mayor of New York City, a distinction                        that earned him the nickname,  Boy Mayor.
A graduate of                        Columbia University and New York Law School, Mitchel held                        numerous government posts after being admitted to the bar.
Hylan grew up a poor farm boy with limited                        education who, at 19, came to New York City with $4.
He graduated                        from New York Law School in 1897 and became active in politics.
Hylan successfully engineered a constitutional amendment                        in the state legislature to create two new Brooklyn judgeships  and a job for himself.
In 1917, Hylan ran for mayor                        on the Tammany Hall ticket, overwhelmingly defeating John                        Purroy Mitchel.
He also was a strong                        advocate for New York City home rule.
Succeeding John Hylan as mayor in 1926, Walker                        faithfully served the interests of Tammany Hall through                        political appointments and the awarding of contracts.
His penchant for frequenting                        nightclubs and enjoying the company of celebrities, including                        actress Betty Compton, earned him the nicknames  Beau James                         and the  Night Mayor.
Despite rumors                          of widespread corruption, New Yorkers largely overlooked                          Walker s transgressions, electing him handily to a second                          term over Fiorello LaGuardia.
In 1931, the state legislature initiated an investigation that uncovered rampant corruption                          in New York City government.
Walker returned to New                          York City in 1935.
O Brien served as City Corporation Counsel and                        as a New York Surrogate Court judge.
Tammany Hall nominated                        him for mayor in 1932 and he beat the Republican candidate                        by more than half a million votes.
He told his                        colleagues,  I know it will be the bar of New York that                        will understand the situation, be able to survey it critically,                        but, at the same time, fairly and justly.
Italian and Jewish ancestry, Fiorello                        LaGuardia, or  Little Flower,  is widely regarded as one                        of the best mayors in New York City history, whose tenure                        redefined the office.
Upon graduating                        New York University Law School in 1910, LaGuardia practiced                        law and was appointed Deputy Attorney General.
After losing the mayoral election to Jimmy Walker                        in 1929, he successfully ran for mayor again in 1933 on                        a fusion ticket against Tammany Hall.
On his first day in office, he delivered a radio address                          to the nation, declaring:  New York City was restored                          to the people this morning at one minute after midnight.
For the next twelve years, the                          5 foot 2, sometimes belligerent chief executive dominated                          life in New York City.
Although technically a Republican, he worked closely with                          the New Deal administration of President Franklin Roosevelt                          to secure funding for large public works projects.
The                          federal subsidies enabled New York City to create a transportation                          network the envy of the world, and to build parks, low-income                          housing, bridges, schools, and hospitals.
He achieved                          the unification of the city s rapid transit system, a                          goal that had long eluded his predecessors, and reformed                          the structure of city government by pushing for a new                          City Charter.
He presided over construction of New York                          City s first municipal airport on Flushing Bay, later                          appropriately named LaGuardia Airport.
LaGuardia s psychological effect                          on New York City was equally profound, restoring faith                          in city government by demanding excellence from civil                          servants.
He was perceived as ubiquitous, always first                          to appear at a fire or natural disaster; he sometimes                          dropped in at city agencies unannounced, periodically                          conducted the municipal orchestra, spoke weekly over the                          radio, and once used that medium to read the comics to                          New Yorkers during a citywide newspaper strike.
In 1945, the first three-term                          New York City mayor decided not to seek a fourth term,                          perhaps hoping to enter national politics.
He worked as a laborer, then as a New York City policeman.
O Dwyer established the Office                          of City Construction Coordinator, appointing Robert Moses                          to the post, worked to have the permanent home of the                          United Nations located in Manhattan, presided over the                          first billion dollar New York City budget, created a traffic                          department and raised the subway fare from five cents                          to ten.
He returned to                          New York City in 1951 to answer questions concerning his                          association with organized crime figures.
He died in New York City on November 24, 1964                          and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
Upon moving to New York, Impellitteri                        attended Fordham Law School, where he received his law degree                        in 1924.
He served as Assistant New York District Attorney                        from 1929 to 1938.
In 1945, Mayor O Dwyer picked Impellitteri                        to run for Council President on the Tammany Hall slate.
When O Dwyer resigned five years later, Impellitteri served                        as acting mayor.
Impellitteri s one term as Mayor                          saw the initiation and completion of many public works                          projects engineered by Robert Moses, including the construction                          of 88 miles of highway and numerous housing projects  between 1945 and 1954, 1,082 public housing buildings                          were constructed.
Upon returning to New York City,                        Wagner served in different capacities under Mayor O Dwyer,                        until he successfully ran for Manhattan Borough President                        in 1949.
In 1953, Wagner ran in the Democratic primary for                        mayor with the backing of Tammany Hall.
During Wagner s twelve years as                          mayor, several large scale projects were initiated or                          completed, such as the construction of the Van Wyck Expressway,                          the Grand Central Parkway, the Long Island Expressway,                          the Verrazano-Narrows and Throgs Neck Bridges, Shea Stadium,                          and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
He practiced law in New York City and                          also served on the City Charter Revision Commission in                          the 1980 s.
In 1989, New York University named its graduate                          school of public service in his honor.
New York City mayor had a more trying first day in                          office then did John Lindsay.
After a decade in private practice in a New York                          law firm, Lindsay went to work for the Justice Department                          in 1955, serving as a liaison to the White House and arguing                          cases before the Supreme Court.
Lindsay, a liberal Republican,                          returned to New York City and won election to Congress                          in Manhattan s heavily Democratic 17th District.
He was                          elected to four terms in the House of Representatives,                          from 1958 to 1964, before running successfully for mayor                          in 1965.
On his first day in office, Lindsay was greeted                          with a crippling transit strike that brought the entire                          city to a near standstill  it proved to be just                          the first of many bitter strikes he would contend with                          during his tenure as mayor.
The transit strike denied Lindsay of sleep for 26 of his first 28 hours as mayor                          and forced the cancellation of a five borough inaugural                          tour.
Before a crowd of 2,500, Lindsay addressed New York                          City s mounting social problems, and the consequences                          of not solving them:  If we fail, the implications of                          our defeat will be assessed throughout the nation, to                          be proclaimed by the cynics as proof that great cities                          are no longer governable.
While civil unrest erupted in other                          major cities during the turbulent late sixties, Lindsay                          helped maintain calm in New York City by taking walking                          tours of the city s urban ghettos.
A graduate of City College, where he received his                        degree in accounting in 1928, Beame opened up an accounting                        firm in Manhattan, taught in New York City public schools,                        and held many posts in city government, including Assistant                        Budget Director under Mayor O Dwyer, Budget Director under                        Mayor Impellitteri, and City Comptroller in 1962.
He ran again for mayor on the Democratic ticket in 1973, winning                        by almost 700,000 votes.
On December 31, 1973, Beame took                          the oath of office in a private ceremony at his home on                          Beach 131 Street in Belle Harbor, Queens  coincidentally,                          on the same Queens street Mayor William O Dwyer took the                          oath three decades before.
The first Jewish mayor of New                          York City, Beame told the 1,500 people gathered at the                          steps of City Hall the following day:  I hope to be a                          matchmaker in the years of my administration, wedding                          our people to their city, encouraging them to identify                          with this great metropolis that is their home.
With New                          York City on the verge of bankruptcy, Beame was forced                          to bring about massive cuts in the city s capital budget                          and to reduce the municipal payroll by 65,000.
It was                          during Beame s term that President Gerald Ford refused                          to provide federal aid to New York City, prompting the                          now famous New York Daily News headline:  Ford to New                          York: Drop Dead.
Despite financial difficulties,                          New York City still managed to host a spectacular bicentennial                          celebration and the Democratic National Convention in                          1976 two events that demonstrated to the country,                          New York City was down but not out.
Koch was elected the 105th Mayor of New York City in                        1977.
Born in the Bronx of Polish Jewish ancestry, Koch s                        family moved to Newark, New Jersey during the Depression                        and later moved to Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn when he was a                        teenager.
He received his law degree                        from New York University Law School in 1948.
In 1977, he sought the Democratic nomination for                        mayor among a crowded field of candidates.
Described in the infancy                        of his mayoralty as a shy and retiring man, Koch used his                        inauguration to send New Yorkers a message of redemption:                         These have been hard times.
We are the city of New York and New York in                        adversity towers above any other city in the world.
With New York City s treasury                          near empty, Koch restored the city s credit in his first                          term through a series of budget cutting measures, enabling                          the city to enter the bond market within a few years and                          raise capital funds.
As the city s fiscal prognosis began                          to brighten, so too did the mood of New Yorkers.
Koch, who vowed to be the first                          four term mayor, sought reelection in 1989.
He has remained extremely active                          and popular since leaving office, practicing law in New                          York City, lecturing, authoring books, serving as a newspaper                          columnist, hosting his own radio show, and more recently,                          serving as a television judge on the popular show,  The                          People s Court.
Dinkins was sworn in as the first                        African American mayor in New York City history.
Born in                        Trenton, New Jersey on October 10, 1927, Dinkins graduated                        magna cum laude from Howard University with a degree in                        mathematics and later received his law degree from Brooklyn                        Law School.
He briefly practiced law in New York City                        and began his steady ascent in politics.
In 1989, he ran                        for mayor, defeating Mayor Edward I.
Giuliani                        by 47,000 votes, the narrowest electoral margin in New York                        City history.
He vowed to be  mayor of all                          the people of New York,  and declared:  We are all foot                          soldiers on the march to freedom.
Dinkins still remains active in New York City                          politics, hosts a weekly radio show, and teaches public                          affairs at Columbia University.
Giuliani became the 107th Mayor                        of the City of New York; four years later, the city he inherited                        has undergone an unprecedented transformation.
Nowhere was this more the case than in New York City.
While                        cynics declared the city ungovernable, New Yorkers yearned                        for change.
Rudolph Giuliani was born in Brooklyn,                          New York in 1944, the son of working class Italian immigrants.
He attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School, Manhattan                          College in the Bronx, and New York University Law School,                          graduating magna cum laude.
Giuliani was                          appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District                          of New York in 1983, earning national acclaim for his                          prosecution of organized crime figures, drug kingpins,                          and white collar criminals.
In 1989, Giuliani ran for                          mayor and was defeated by David Dinkins.
Giuliani ran again for mayor in                          1993, this time as the candidate of the Republican, Liberal,                          and IndependentFusion parties.
His message of fiscal                          responsibility and attention to quality of life concerns                          resonated with New Yorkers, who elected him over incumbent                          David Dinkins.
Giuliani used the occasion of his inauguration                          to stake out an ambitious agenda for change, and to reach                          out to New Yorkers by touring the five boroughs.
He called                          upon New Yorkers to  look anew  at their city:  Dream                          with me of a city that can be better than the way it is                          now.
Upon taking office, Giuliani set out to reverse New York                          City s downward spiral and improve the overall quality                          of life.
Since 1993, the city has experienced an unprecedented                          44 percent drop in overall crime and a 61 percent drop                          in murder, making New York the safest large city in America.
As a result of these targeted tax cuts,                          the hotel and tourism industries are thriving, 180,000                          private sector jobs have been created, and a national                          financial magazine named New York City the most improved                          American city in which to do business.
Giuliani also cracked                          down on organized crime to lift the illegal tax the mob                          had exacted on certain New York City industries for generations.
He kept the rate                          of spending below the rate of inflation for the first                          time in New York City history and created a $500 million                          reserve fund.
Giuliani is also credited with                          introducing a new level of accountability and higher standards                          of performance into the school system.
Giuliani is also negotiating to have the Police Department                          assume responsibility for creating a safe environment                          in New York City s public schools.

Riding a ravenous desire by voters for change, Bill de Blasio scored a crushing victory over Republican Joe Lhota Tuesday to become New York’s 109th mayor — and the first Democrat to hold the office in 20 years.
With 97% of the precincts reporting, de Blasio held a commanding lead of 74% to 24% — the largest margin of victory by a nonincumbent in any mayor’s race in city history.

New York  CNN  – Bill de Blasio will be the first Democratic mayor in New York City in two decades, easily defeating Republican Joe Lhota by running a campaign that rejected the politics of his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg.
Known for its liberal politics, New York City has not elected a Democrat in the last five mayoral elections, with Bloomberg serving three terms and Rudolph Giuliani before him serving two.
Is he qualified to run New York City?
Until recently, de Blasio was a relative unknown in New York City politics.
De Blasio brushes off his critics by saying that he has heard the criticisms many times during his 25-year public life in New York City.
DeBlasio calls himself the  unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era,  saying that the current mayor s polices favor the rich.
He has repeatedly used phrases such as  income inequality  and  a tale of two cities  to describe New York City under Bloomberg.
One of the most controversial issues in the race was the  stop-and-frisk  policy that allows New York police to search people in high-crime areas.
New York to its knees, where it belongs for voting for a leftist loser.

New York  CNN  -- One day after New York officials announced a Doctors Without Borders physician had tested positive for Ebola, another person who treated patients in West Africa developed a fever and was put in isolation at a northern New Jersey hospital.
The second health care worker, a woman who hasn t been identified by name, did not have any Ebola symptoms upon arrival Friday at Newark Liberty International Airport, New Jersey health department spokesman Donna Leusner said.
Craig Spencer, the 33-year-old now in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in nearby New York City, this second health care worker is not confirmed to have Ebola.
To this end, the governors of New York and New Jersey announced Friday their states were stepping up airport screening for Ebola beyond federal requirements for travelers from Ebola-hit countries in West Africa.
This is not the time to take chances,  New York Gov.
Andrew Cuomo -- joined by his New Jersey counterpart, Chris Christie -- said of the shift.
He arrived October 17 at New York s John F.
New York City health commissioner Mary Bassett -- until Thursday, at which time he also had nausea, pain and fatigue.
There is no cause for alarm,  Mayor Bill de Blasio said.
There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routines in any way.
Spencer, employed at New York s Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, has been in isolation at Bellevue since emergency personnel took him there Thursday morning.
Kaci Hickox, a nurse who recently returned to the United States after working in Ebola-ravaged West Africa, sent CNN this image of the tent where she was being isolated for Ebola monitoring Sunday, October 26, in New Jersey.
Hickox is going to be discharged, New Jersey s Department of Health said in a statement Monday, October 27.
Police officers on Thursday, October 23, stand outside the New York City apartment of Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who recently returned from West Africa and tested positive for Ebola.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, trying to take the edge off the city’s Ebola fears, dined on meatballs at a restaurant previously visited by the doctor who brought the virus from West Africa.
Craig Spencer, New York’s first patient to test positive for Ebola, checked into Bellevue Hospital Center last week with a 100.
Spencer’s movements across the nation’s most populous city touched off alarm among residents and an announcement by New York, New Jersey and Illinois that the states will quarantine anyone arriving at their airports who had direct contact with Ebola patients.
At a press conference outside the restaurant, the mood was more sober, as the mayor gave an update on Ebola, saying Spencer’s fiancé and two of his friends will remain in quarantine until November 14.
De Blasio defended Spencer against those who said he had acted recklessly in traveling in New York.
Th mayor encouraged more doctors to go to Africa to “kill the disease” and help protect the U.

The staff was reportedly told by the zoo to avoid telling the mayor s office.
The groundhog that normally takes part in the festivities, Chuck, was benched this year because he once bit the city s previous mayor, Michael Bloomberg.

Who Is Bill de Blasio, and Could He Be New York s Next Mayor?
The surprise new leader in the New York mayoral race is Bill de Blasio, a yuppie Brooklyn dad who’s running as a crusading liberal.
If the poll is right and de Blasio gets more than 40 percent of the vote Tuesday, he will become the Democratic nominee, heavily favored to win the general election in a city where 68 percent of voters are registered Democrats, just 11 percent are Republicans, and New Yorkers, while generally satisfied with the city’s direction, are ready for a change after 12 years of Mayor Mike Bloomberg.
The speed and extent to which he’s leapfrogged Thompson and Quinn and taken a commanding position in the race has surprised a lot of people,” says Doug Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College, who has known de Blasio since the two worked together on the 1989 mayoral campaign of David Dinkins, New York’s first and only black mayor.
Despite being a fixture of the New York’s tumultuous politics for more than two decades, de Blasio remains largely unknown.
Here are eight things you might not know about the man who stands a good chance of becoming the next mayor of America’s largest city.
The Afro became a sensation in the campaign, and the New York Daily News  even accused de Blasio of “cashing in on  son’s hair.
According to the campaign’s research, de Blasio would be the first New York mayor in history with a child in the New York public schools.
But when she met de Blasio in 1991 -- he was an aide to then-Mayor Dinkins and she was working for the city’s human-rights commission -- she fell in love, she told Essence earlier this year.
After working in the Dinkins administration, de Blasio ran New York for Bill Clinton’s reelection campaign, then took a post in the federal Housing and Urban Development department under Andrew Cuomo, who s now the governor of New York.
With Clinton dogged by accusations of carpetbagging, de Blasio appears to have been picked as much for his New York bona fides as his political chops.

Welcome to Beautiful Rome, New York.
September 2013*: Michael Rubens Bloomberg became New York City s 108th mayor on 1 January 2002, re-elected in 2005 and, more controversially, 2009.
The mayor is also leader of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition and C40 climate change group.
Bloomberg’s election as mayor in 2001 came in the aftermath of 9 11, with two-term Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani prevented from standing again by term limits.
Giuliani’s tenure as mayor was notable for the zero tolerance policies he had pioneered alongside NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, having made his name as a tough city prosecutor during the 1980s.
This was given as one consideration of his decision in 2001 to seek the post of New York Mayor as a Republican, rather than a Democrat, due to his belief that having no political background to draw on, the tightly organised factions in the city party would opt for a favoured son.
The New York Democrats eventually chose Mark Green, a consumer activist and associate of Ralph Nader.
Bloomberg himself defeated former Democratic Congressman and Deputy Mayor Herman Badillo in the Republican primary, which had to be re-staged because of the events of 9 11.
He does not reside in the official residence of the New York Mayor, Gracie Mansion, but at his own home on the Upper East Side.
He also waives his entitlement to the mayor’s salary and accepts a token payment of one dollar annually.
The mayor has also supported the extension of the city’s smoking ban to drinking establishments.
His handling of the unsuccessful 2012 Olympic bid also led some to question his leadership, especially over his much-derided proposals to give the New York Mets a new stadium.
Though reticent on his post-mayoral ambitions and coy about stating anything beyond a return to philanthropy once he departs from city hall, permutations of a Bloomberg ticket included Los Angeles Mayor Villaraigosa, a Democrat, as a potential vice president to add political and geographical balance.
In the final year of his third and his final term as mayor, Bloomberg can point to an administration notable for not only his economic stewardship but also bold and innovative stances on social and environmental issues.
It has been said that Bilbao’s transformation from a declining industrial city in Spain’s Basque Province to an international centre for tourism and the arts has been sparked off by two events: the opening of Guggenheim Museum in 1997 and the election of Iñaki Azkuna as mayor two years later.
Since being first elected, Mayor Iñaki Azkuna has used the high profile of the Guggenheim Museum, designed architect Frank Gehry, to re-build the city.

NEW YORK  Reuters  - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order on Tuesday to raise the minimum hourly wage by more than a dollar to $13.
The increase, which expands an existing program to cover more New Yorkers, applies to workers employed by large businesses that are tenants of buildings developed with the help of more than $1 million in city subsidies.
Some prospective commercial tenants will resist leasing space in projects that impose wage and compliance requirements that are more onerous than market practice,  said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive officer of the Partnership for New York City.
The organization represents 200 large companies that employ around 775,000 New Yorkers.

By 2050, New York City will emit 80 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than it did in 2005, under a new plan announced Sunday by Mayor Bill de Blasio.
The plan will focus first on buildings, whose heating, cooling and power are responsible for almost three-quarters of New York City’s emissions.
The city also plans to implement new, more-energy efficient standards for new construction, using principles of “zero net energy” and carbon neutral construction to inform the standards.
In addition, the report states, the plan is expected to save New Yorkers $1.
At the beginning of his time as Mayor of New York, de Blasio’s commitment to climate change wasn’t clear : the mayor hadn’t made sustainability issues and climate change a major part of his campaign, and his administration was quiet on the issue for the first several months of his tenure.
But the plan could be seen as a turning point for the administration: Donna DeCostanzo from the Natural Resources Defense Council told the New York Times that the Mayor’s new plan “could be the most far-reaching one of its kind.
De Blasio also marched in New York City’s People’s Climate March on Sunday, a protest that’s being called the largest climate march in history.

Mayor Byron Brown took the Oath of Office as the 58th Mayor of Buffalo, New York on December 31, 2005.
Elected Mayor with over 60 percent of the vote in the November 2005 General Election, Mayor Brown came into office emphasizing greater accountability and efficiency in City Hall, improving the quality of life for all city residents and a commitment to strengthening and expanding the city’s economic development activities.
Since taking office, Mayor Brown has followed those three guiding principles by launching a Zero Tolerance Law Enforcement initiative targeting quality of life crimes, along with other criminal activity in the city; implemented the management accountability tracking CitiStat Buffalo program, which monitors city departments’ service delivery activities on a weekly basis; and reconfigured the city’s economic development activities by creating the Department of Economic Development, Permit and Inspection Services, a change that has provided greater coordination and cooperation in all development activities taking place in the City of Buffalo.

New York City s five district attorneys have tried for months to get a group meeting with Mayor de Blasio to discuss crucial budget and public safety issues, as they have with past mayors, but their requests have been ignored, NBC 4 New York has learned.
New York City s five district attorneys have tried for months to get a group meeting with Mayor de Blasio to discuss crucial budget and public safety issues, as they have with past mayors, but their requests have been ignored, NBC 4 New York has learned.
Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson sent an email on behalf of the group in March to meet with the mayor, according to sources familiar with the request.
In the email, Johnson acknowledged de Blasio’s  tight schedule  and asked that the mayor meet with him and the other four district attorneys at his convenience to discuss  how to work together  in the best interest of the city.
We wish to continue our cooperation with NYPD and your office,  the email said, according to a copy obtained by NBC 4 New York.
Johnson s office said the mayor s scheduler responded,  Thank you, we will be in touch,  but the mayor s office never followed up.

Amanda Burden, considered one of the most influential figures in New York City government, has led the planning office under Mayor Michael Bloomberg for nearly a dozen years.
Sadik-Khan listens behind Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz -- a sometimes-adversary who has called her a “zealot” -- at the opening of a new pedestrian plaza.
Under Sadik-Khan’s tenure, the transportation department has added more than 285 miles of new bicycle lanes.
The city aggressively pushed for the development of Select Bus Service, a new approach to busing that includes dedicated lanes and off-board fare collection to make rides quicker and more reliable.
With Mayor Bloomberg s term in office ending this year, many observers have questioned whether the city s progress on bike and pedestrian issues will continue under his successor.
Inside New York City Planning Director Amanda Burden’s office a block from city hall, a huge photograph of Brooklyn’s waterfront leans against the wall.
It’s the same scene that Burden showed Mayor Michael Bloomberg when she took him on a tour of New York City more than 11 years ago, back when he was just starting to consider a run at the city’s highest office.
The tour along that waterfront, Burden says, was an emotional experience, since both she and Bloomberg saw an amenity that New Yorkers could potentially be enjoying but instead had long been denied.
The two have taken to referring to New York’s waterfront as the city’s “sixth borough,” and developments along the water -- from Brooklyn Bridge Park in Brooklyn to Freshkills Park in Staten Island to the East River Esplanade in Lower Manhattan -- have been among the administration’s highest-profile undertakings.
America’s most famous mayor has gained international attention for his ardent advocacy on issues like gun control, immigration reform, infrastructure investment and climate change.
But for New Yorkers, Bloomberg’s most important legacy -- the one that affects their daily lives most -- may be the role he’s played in reshaping the urban landscape.
If predecessor Rudolph Giuliani was the mayor who made New York a safer place to live, Bloomberg is the guy who’s made it a more pleasant one.
Now, his mayoral tenure is coming to an end; a new leader will be elected in six months.
As Mitchell Moss, a New York University urban planning professor and media-dubbed “New Yorkologist,” walks past Petrosino Park, he says it was a “shithouse for meth heads” until a few short years ago.
The city  in a $2 million project championed by former Councilman Alan Gerson  enlarged the park and added new benches, trees and lighting.
The mile-long park has significantly altered the neighborhood around it, attracting tremendous new development and becoming a favorite spot for residents and visitors alike.
I think for a good 50 years, there was a sense that this is our city, and we’re stuck with it,” says Aaron Naparstek, a fellow at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design and founder of the website Streetsblog, which covers land-use and transportation policy in New York.
We clearly have moved into a new era now where people see that it’s really possible to redesign New York City streets, the waterfront, the public spaces and the parks,” Naparstek continues.
He’s not afraid to take risks,” says Robert Lieber, who served as Bloomberg’s deputy mayor for economic development from 2008 to 2010.
Those close to him say that while livability is absolutely one of the mayor’s priorities, he’s comfortable deferring the specifics to his lieutenants.
As she points out, only about one-third of New Yorkers regularly drive.
And she’s probably not exaggerating when she says her office has made the most significant changes to New York’s roadways since one-way streets were introduced 50 years ago.
In addition to the unprecedented proliferation of bike lanes in New York, the department this spring will help launch the largest bike-share program in the country, capitalizing on an urban amenity that has proven extraordinarily popular in other cities.
And throughout New York, Sadik-Khan’s department has embarked on an ambitious plaza program: Using planters and other barricades, the city has blocked off parts of some streets to establish pedestrian plazas with benches and chairs.
Among the most prominent of the new plazas are those in Times Square and further south along Broadway, where pedestrians lounge or stroll along streets that were, at one time, major thoroughfares filled with honking cars.
She’s frequently been criticized by New York tabloids.
The New York Post calls her the “psycho bike lady;” Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz calls her a “zealot.
A mayor with a more conservative style might have waited until after November to pursue such an unusual undertaking, Sadik-Khan says.
The New York Times has chronicled a technique used by the administration -- and in particular the transportation department -- to launch projects as “pilots,” as a clever way to cut through red tape and escape the typical city review process.
It’s diverse, and  always a sense of change -- something new and exciting.
Bloomberg has elevated the prominence of planning and zoning issues, giving Burden’s office unmatched influence and facilitating initiatives like the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, a mixed-used real estate development being erected over a train yard along the western edge of Midtown Manhattan, or the development of Lower Manhattan’s Seward Park, which will create a mixed-used space on six acres of underutilized land that will include a new market, commercial space and affordable housing.
In New York, development occurs “as-of-right,” meaning that if a developer wants to build something that conforms exactly to the existing zoning standards, he can do so with little more than a building permit.
The concept of setting the table to allow these neighborhoods to grow and change is a positive thing,” says Mitch Korbey, a land-use attorney and director of the planning department’s Brooklyn office under Mayor Giuliani.
And that has really been important, not only for iconic, cultural buildings, but in areas like the South Bronx” where thousands of new housing developments are being built, she says.
And even if some developers have bristled at Burden’s approach, it has served New York well, says Korbey.
New York is a better place to live now than it was a decade ago.
Will the next mayor build something like the High Line?
Among them are Christine Quinn, the speaker of the New York City Council who’s seen as Bloomberg’s heir apparent; Public Advocate Bill de Blasio; Joseph Lhota, who recently resigned as chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority; Bill Thompson, the former city comptroller; and Joseph Liu, the current comptroller.
However it shakes out, Streetsblog’s Naparstek says, New Yorkers will likely miss the independence that comes with a billionaire mayor who’s a political outsider.
The next mayor almost certainly is not going to be insulated.
Some wonder whether the next mayor would literally start removing bike lanes.
Bloomberg’s critics say the rash of development under his leadership has been a boon for developers and gentrifiers but has done little to benefit the average New Yorker.
Is New York becoming a luxury item?
That’s a notion echoed by Sadik-Khan, who says that in many cases the transformations happening in New York are more of a response to the wants and needs of residents than the product of anyone’s political agenda.
But there’s still a sense among many observers that it will be difficult for any successor to match Bloomberg’s impact on the overall look and feel of New York City.
I think it’s going to be very hard,” says Moss, “for any mayor to equal what Mike Bloomberg has done.

NEW YORK — Bright autumn sunshine spilled over the red-striped awning of the Meatball Shop in the West Village on Saturday afternoon.
Inside the restaurant, a dozen photographers and journalists elbowed each other for room, waiting for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to make his appearance.
As is the habit of politicians in times of public crisis, the mayor was trying to allay fears of Ebola by eating in the restaurant in which Craig Spencer had eaten just four days earlier.
De Blasio had already ridden the subway lines that Spencer had taken Tuesday and Wednesday, so lunch at the Meatball Shop with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and New York City’s health commissioner, Mary Bassett, was, shall we say, next on the menu.
Ebola in New York City might have been big news elsewhere, but it hadn’t set off cries of Armageddon among most Manhattanites.

From left, Daniel Holzman, co-owner of the Meatball Shop; New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio; his wife, Chirlane McCray; and New York City Health Commissioner Mary Bassett talk at the restaurant where Craig Spencer, an Ebola patient, ate before he became ill with the virus.
What we know next, according to New York City officials, is that the following day, Wednesday, Spencer took a three-mile run along Riverside Drive and around 2 p.
Paulin, who has lived in New York for 10 years, sounded philosophical about the risk of catching Ebola.
Taxis, cars and trucks hurtled past the Meatball Shop all day Saturday, and the traffic did not come to a standstill when the mayor stopped in for a bite.
He ordered a root beer and four chicken meatballs with tomato sauce while a dozen photographers leaned across tables taking pictures of the smiling mayor and his guests.
He said that New Yorkers were resilient and that if they were hungry Saturday night, they all should visit the Meatball Shop.

New NYC mayor wants horse-drawn carriages out NYC s Mayor de Blasio wants to replace the horse-drawn carriages with electric cars Check out this story on USATODAY.
NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to get rid of the horse-drawn carriages that have been a fixture in Central Park and Midtown for about 150 years.
NYC s Mayor de Blasio wants to replace the horse-drawn carriages with electric cars.
Horse-drawn carriages line Central Park South in New York City.
Almost since the 1857 beginnings of Central Park, New York s horse-drawn carriages have guided tourists and others through the park and downtown streets of the city.
New York s new mayor, Bill de Blasio, insists that carriages that typically carry passengers through the hills and valleys of the park and along streets as far south as 34th Street have got to go.
We are going to quickly and aggressively move to make horse carriages no longer a part of the landscape in New York City,  de Blasio said during a Dec.
The mayor wants to replace the horses and carriages with electric cars that have a vintage appearance, a move that de Blasio says will be good for the environment and help the drivers stay employed.
This is not the first time someone or a group has spoken out against them, but de Blasio is the highest-ranking New Yorker to take on the tourist attraction.
The debate pits de Blasio and supporters of a group called New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets, or NYCLASS against the carriage drivers and others who want the carriages to stay.
The drivers say the mayor and NYCLASS are way off base and that removing the horses and carriages would be like stripping the city of part of its personality.
Phil have made it a point to take a ride when in New York, they said.
Horses and carriages upholstered in felt and leather began clip-clopping through Central Park in 1858,according to the Horse and Carriage Association of New York City.
On a typical day in New York, drivers gather on Central Park South across from the Plaza Hotel, feeding and grooming their horses and waiting for customers.
Many of the drivers do the work because they grew up with horses, says Stephen Malone, a driver and a spokesman for the Horse and Carriage Association of New York City.
He doesn t know what he will do to support his wife and three children if the mayor s plan makes it through the council.
He scoffed at the mayor s electric car proposal.
We enthusiastically applaud Mayor de Blasio and his efforts to get these abused animals off the streets,  says NYCLASS executive director Allie Feldman.
WASHINGTON,  January 1, 2014 — Comrade Bill De Blasio was sworn in this morning as the Mayor of New York City.
Comrade” is the right title for the new mayor.
De Blasio is starting off his reign as dictator of New York by dictating.
These are the iconic horse drawn carriages in New York.
New York doesn’t need a legislative body like the city counsel.
Of course, Michael Bloomberg, the outgoing Mayor had his own delusions of dictatorial grandeur too.
Comrade De Blasio wants to take New York back in time to the 70’s.
His policies will make New York an unsafe place, where criminals rule.
When New York City goes bankrupt, the Republicans should let it fail.
Let New York City fail.
Perhaps ten years from now, there will be tours of the ruins of New York.
If New York fails, businesses and people will relocate to places where business and employment are welcome.
If the people of New York want a communist Mayor, let them have the consequences of it.
For Republicans, don’t bail New York out.
Let it and its communist Mayor fail.
New York’s mayor takes on charter schools, and the national education debate hangs in the balance.
New York City s first lady Chirlane McCray and Mayor Bill de Blasio laugh during a roundtable discussion with parent bloggers in the Blue Room of City Hall on March 7, 2014.
While running for New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio could count on applause for attacking unpopular charter school co-locations, where charters that need space are squeezed into public school buildings alongside other schools.
So the new mayor must be feeling whiplash after the outcry that met him as he began to carry out a popular campaign pledge: slow down the charter co-locations and shift more money to traditional public schools.
That the charter community opposed the mayor wasn’t a surprise.
He’s part of the national “pushback” movement against school reform, which saw the progressive mayor’s election as validation of its views.
Charter schools are a high-profile target of these anti-reform activists, but they are also fighting against standardized testing, the new Common Core standards, teacher evaluations based on student outcomes, and reforms to teacher tenure and pay.
The mayor’s first misstep was going after one specific charter network , Success Academy, run by Eva Moskowitz, a former city council member who has clashed with de Blasio in years past over city education policies.
Among the 870 Success Academy seats blocked was a modest 194-student expansion for Success Academy students in Harlem to move into a new middle school.
That triggered days of searing press coverage pointing out that those 194 students, all low-income minorities, were coming from a school, Success Academy 4, that killed it on the new state test scores , with 80 percent of the students passing the math test, and 59 percent the English test.
The co-located middle school the mayor is protecting and where many of those 194 charter students would end up: P.
In Albany, Cuomo was more than ready to grab the low-hanging political fruit left by the mayor and position himself as the foremost elected education reformer in the state while bolstering his national credentials.
The rally drowned out the mayor’s efforts to get Albany to focus on preschool expansion and, with his approval ratings tumbling into the 30s after just a few weeks on the job, de Blasio effectively cried uncle late last week.
For example, consider the four prominent mayors now on a tour to talk about education innovation : Mayor Julian Castro of San Antonio, a rising Democratic star and the keynote speaker at the 2012 Democratic National Convention; Kevin Johnson of Sacramento, Calif.
Conference of Mayors; Denver Mayor Michael Hancock; and Providence, R.
Another fan of Denver-style solutions is Sacramento’s Johnson, who is closely watching New York developments.
New York is the home of some  the best charter schools in the nation  he says, referring to the various studies that show New York s charters are stronger collectively than charter schools in many other states.
Now, after she stood up to de Blasio, some New York political observers are already talking about her as a viable mayoral candidate in the next election.
Now he’s beloved for siding so strongly with the charter parents against the mayor.
Besides making new political foes, de Blasio is exposing the growing rift over education policy among Democrats.
New York has an outsized importance in the education world.
What does or doesn’t happen in New York reverberates throughout the country,” Sacramento’s Johnson told us.
If de Blasio can figure out how to regain momentum and harness progressive support to improve schools in New York City—taking the rough edges off of Mayor Bloomberg–era policies and hewing a different path from reformist Democratic mayors—that would change the terms of the national education debate.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says his office is preparing to implement changes to the cell phone policy in the city s public schools.
The mayor said he wants to allow students to have phones, which were banned during Mayor Michael Bloomberg s administration.
The mayor says his office will come up with a timeline for the new strategy in the coming weeks.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is a multi-billionaire.
He wants to be the country s nanny, and yet he doesn t know enough about the country to understand that most Americans don t travel primarily by taxi or limo and that roads are a common feature of metropolitan areas, outside of New York City and Hollywood.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signs an executive order raising the living wage law on Sept.
Labor advocacy groups welcomed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s signing on Tuesday of an executive order that will raise wages for thousands of New Yorkers, saying it will help people survive in the notoriously expensive city.
De Blasio said the order expands a 2012 “living wage” law that previously applied to only 1,200 New York jobs.
The executive order will cover employees of commercial tenants in development projects that take in more than $1 million in city subsidies, The New York Times said Tuesday.

The average hourly pay for private-sector employees in  New York state  was $27.
During de Blasio’s campaign for mayor last year, he condemned economic inequality in America’s most populous city.
We cannot continue to allow rampant and growing income inequality,” de Blasio told The New York Times.
This new living wage executive order will improve the lives of thousands of low-wage workers, especially in the retail sector,  Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union, said in a news release.

New York s newly elected mayor is already walking away from one of the city s oldest traditions: The St.
Bill de Blasio will become the first mayor in decades to sit out the March 17 amble along Fifth Avenue.
While both his predecessors Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani participated in the parade, de Blasio did not march in the parade even when in the roll of public advocate,  NBC New York  reported.
The Empire State Pride Agenda, a New York civil rights and advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender New Yorkers, commended the mayor s decision.
New York City has long celebrated the myriad and colorful intersectionalities of our identities, and we’re a great city for that very reason.
No LGBT New Yorker should be denied the opportunity to fly the colors of the Irish and Rainbow flags simultaneously, to proudly represent all aspects of our city s heritage,” the group’s executive director, Nathan M.
The mayor, a Democrat who campaigned on bringing more equality to the city, also said Tuesday that he won t heed activists  call to ban city workers from marching while wearing their uniforms.
With an 88% stake in Bloomberg LP, the former Mayor of New York is back at a firm that is drastically different from where he left it: with annual revenues that will top $9 billion in 2014 and a massive concentration of its profits coming from the terminal business.
Bloomberg displaced his former Deputy Mayor, Daniel Doctoroff, who as CEO pushed for diversification, despite pushing for Doctoroff to remain on board.
Bloomberg, who ran New York City for 12 years, rose to become head of equity trading and then information services, before being let go in 1981 when the firm was acquired.

Just ten days into his tenure, Bill de Blasio is already facing a scandal that has many New Yorkers questioning whether he is truly fit for the job.
De Blasio was photographed eating pizza with a knife and fork — a New York City faux pas that the Daily News has already dubbed “Forkgate.
The image spawned angry outbursts across the web, with the New York Post proclaiming , “Some New Yorker!
The neophyte mayor, who acknowledged on the campaign trail that he was a fan of the reviled Boston Red Sox, was at a Staten Island’s “Goodfellas Pizza” when he picked up the cutlery, the Daily News reports.
But he added, “All New Yorkers eat their pizza with their hands.
In my ancestral homeland, it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife,” the mayor said.
He’s not the first mayor to draw criticism for his dining habits.

ON NOVEMBER 5th the keys to New York’s City Hall were returned to Democratic hands after 20 years of Republican or Independent leadership.
Bill de Blasio, New York’s public advocate, soundly defeated Joe Lhota, his Republican opponent, in New York’s mayoral election.
During his victory speech in Brooklyn, the new mayor-elect bragged that New Yorkers had  chosen a progressive path.
Why have New Yorkers voted for a Democratic mayor ?
On his watch New York seemed to become a city of bold projects again.
Polls show more than half of voters thought Mr Bloomberg did a good job, but Mr de Blasio’s crushing win shows New Yorkers wanted change.
But despite Mr de Blasio’s Bloomberg-bashing during the campaign, his victory is in a way a return to New York City’s blue roots.
New York has not voted for a Republican for president since Calvin Coolidge in 1924; Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.
In those elections, New Yorkers voted out of fear.
For young New Yorkers today, a scary New York is an alien notion.
He will be the country’s most liberal-leaning big-city mayor.
LaGuardia, mayor during the 1930s and 1940s, was one of the most successful and popular New York mayors.
At the end of the day, New Yorkers want potholes filled, their streets ploughed when it snows and their rubbish picked up.

New York has not voted for a Republican for president since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 yet Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.
The main driver was the sense the city is no longer home to New Yorkers but to real estate investors from abroad and to the coterie of services arranged around the really rich.
That is of course only partly true, but it hits you in the face over and over: new building here and there and this one taller and that one and all the apartments are priced in the tens of millions .
That remains but New Yorkers don t like this direction because it feels like the city is being made into something that is not NYC, that is not full of vitality.
This is a mayor handpicked by the NYTimes.
Perhaps it really is Shanghai s time to take over as the new financial capital of the world.

New Yorkers like the idea of having a liberal Democrat for a mayor, but when push comes to shove what they really demand is a competent manager for a large and complex city.
To answer the headline of this story:  New Yorkers are tired of lower crime rates than in the last 40 years!
I still remember the predictions of doom and gloom right after the election of  Red  Ken Livingstone to become the Mayor of London, so I still have hope.
It s important to note that the past 20 years of Republican administration of NYC was a reaction to the populist policies of Mayor Lindsay and his ilk, who subverted New York s financial stability in pursuit of a socialistic ideal of income and racial equality.
Now New York City appears to have come full circle, bringing back into power the kind of left wingers who were responsible for its permanent decline, who opposed its partial renaissance, and who would take New York back to a dark place of strikes, tolerated levels of brutal street violence, and crippling taxation on the very businesses which provide employment and tax revenue to keep the whole machine running.
His CV seemed perfect for the job, and instead New Yorkers went for the other guy.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio held a press.
New York mayor Bill de Blasio thinks he’s doing the taxi cartel that runs the city’s famous yellow cabs a favor.
Now, he’s appointed one of his taxi fundraisers  to be a taxi regulator, and more importantly, held up plans to expand the city’s taxi fleet by an additional 6,000 new cabs.
The extra cabs would have been part of the “borough cab” program introduced by Bloomberg, which was designed to alleviate New York City’s congenital shortage of cabs outside downtown Manhattan.
This is much the same reason it opposes new entrants like Uber and other car services that use the internet to provide car service outside the regulated framework of the taxis.
But by restricting the number of cabs, the mayor is essentially making Uber’s case for its own existence.
And that’s really where New York’s government is failing.
It’s neither meeting the demand for paid car services by approving new cabs, nor is it creating a system whereby Uber, or its competitors Lyft and Sidecar, can safely fill the gap.
And, if the city ever does decide to start regulating the Ubers of the world, it will be easier for those companies to allege that the new rules are designed only to benefit incumbent taxi companies—and harder for de Blasio to convince the public otherwise.
Healthy Food will sustain our City’s greatest natural resource, New Yorkers.

It was a very New York day for Peter Ragone, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s aide-de-camp.

Ragone, 44, is not the gray mandarin tugging at the strings of the gawky de Blasio puppet, dictating the mayor’s every move.
