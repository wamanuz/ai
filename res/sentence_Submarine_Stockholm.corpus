The submarine hunts or submarine incidents were a series of several incidents involving foreign submarines that occurred in Swedish territorial waters during the Cold War .
In this time, there was intensive debate and speculation in Swedish media about the possibility of Soviet submarine infiltration of Swedish territorial waters .
While there had been earlier incidents involving foreign submarines  as seen below , the incidents normally referred to in this context are those that followed the sensational stranding of the Soviet submarine U 137 deep inside Swedish waters on October 27, 1981.
Reports of new submarine sightings and television imagery of Swedish Navy helicopters firing depth charges into coastal waters against suspected intruders became commonplace in the mid-to-late 1980s.
While the submarine sightings subsided with the fall of the Soviet Union, the debate about these events has reemerged sporadically.
During a military exercise, a submarine is discovered by radar echo and hydrophone, north of Fårö at Gotland.
At 0500 a submarine was reported being sighted in Gullmarsfjorden and warning shots were fired by nearby forces.
At October 24 at mid day a submarine turret was spotted outside the naval depot ÖGull, deep inside Gullmarsfjorden.
Immediately after this, the other sweepers both noticed stirred up water, a possible sign of submarine propellers in motion.
At dawn  now the 25th  Hasslö moved southwards and after a while its crew spotted a submarine periscope above the surface.
The helicopter group was scrambled to the location, managed to establish contact with the submarine and attacked with depth charges.
After that the contact with the submarine was lost.
During a naval drill on the coast of Norrland, the Swedish submarine Springaren comes into contact with a foreign submarine in Swedish waters; it leaves the scene.
A submarine periscope is spotted by the Swedish Coast Guard near Kappelhamnsviken on Gotland .
A destroyer is sent to the scene and establishes contact, at which point the foreign submarine leaves Swedish waters.
During a naval drill in the Stockholm Archipelago, a Soviet Type W submarine exposes itself by using radar, outside Swedish territorial waters.
A Swedish submarine monitors the Soviet vessel entering Swedish waters, and records sounds from it.
When Swedish submarine-hunting helicopters and destroyers arrive, it speeds out towards international waters and disappears.
The Swedish Marine tugboat Ajax discovers the turret of a submarine outside Utö in the Stockholm Archipelago .
The submarine does not leave the area, but attempts to avoid capture, and a prolonged submarine hunt began.
This lasted for several weeks, during which time the submarine is repeatedly sighted.
On the evening of October 28, 1981, a fisherman residing in the eastern part of the Karlskrona archipelago phoned in to the Swedish Coast Guard and reported that a submarine had run aground in Gåsefjärden , 30 km from the town centre of Karlskrona.
The grounded submarine generated intense media interest, and Swedish military forces were put on high alert following suspicions that the Soviet Union would try to recapture the vessel.
This marked the beginning of the  submarine hunts   ubåtsjakter , as nicknamed by Swedish media.
After a long period of submarine incidents, the Swedish Navy sets a trap by sealing off an area with mines and sensors.
A foreign submarine is then recognized to have entered the trap, and the navy responds in force with major forces stationed nearby.
A reported 44 depth charges and 4 naval mines are detonated, trying to sink the submarine, but it is later determined that it avoided the trap or fled at an early stage.
Later research has cast doubt on many of the conclusions of the committee, with some of the sound recordings from the purported submarine now believed to have come from a civilian ship.
The entire incident is now hotly disputed, with some arguing the submarine may have been of NATO origin.
A suspected submarine is reported in Törefjärden , North of Luleå , and mines are detonated.
Helicopters establish contact with a foreign submarine, but are unable to fire, reportedly because civilian journalists have entered the safety area.

The sea floor is examined, and double-track trace is discovered, allegedly from a submarine vehicle, extending 1100 meters.
While examining the magnetic sensors of a minefield in Kappelshamnsviken on Gotland , the military discovers  clear traces on the bottom from a tracked submarine vehicle .

A large military operation is launched to search for an allegedly damaged submarine in Kanholmsfjärden in the Stockholm archipelago .
The sources of the transmissions were identified as a submarine and a military site in the Kaliningrad region.
On 19 October the military said there had been three separate sightings and released a picture of the unidentified submarine to the public.
There were also suggestions that the Russian Oil-tanker NS Concord was involved as a mother-ship for smaller underwater vehicles as it maintained a pattern of criss-crossing outside Stockholm during the investigation.
A Russian research ship equipped with a submarine holding bay, R V Professor Logachev ,   was also in the area and turned off its location transponder.
Paul Schwartz at Center for Strategic and International Studies , CSIS, said the photograph could be a Russian Lada-class submarine .
U 137 , many of the supposed submarine incidents were based on intelligence reports, radar, underwater sensors, or witness statements, giving a less than full picture of the source of the disturbance.
There is also a dispute concerning sound recordings purported to be of submarine engines, which some now allege stem from natural sounds, fish, mink , civilian vessels, etc.
Swedish military teams are said to have registered high levels of radiation on geiger counters when examining the stranded submarine.
Following the stranding of a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine in 1981 on the Swedish archipelago, a series of massive submarine intrusions took place within Swedish waters.
Royal Navy submarine captains have also admitted to top-secret operations.
Mankell’s play Politik, which debuted in autumn 2010, also dealt with the submarine incidents.
In 1984 a Finn living in Sweden published the satirical Finnish novel Probable Submarine  Todennäköinen sukellusvene  under the pen-name Klaus Viking.
The novel is an examination of Swedish culture and politics as seen through the eyes of a Finnish immigrant who takes it upon himself to create some excitement by constructing a sham submarine and towing it through a restricted military area of the archipelago.
It reflects a certain degree of amusement with which some segments of Sweden s neighbor populations regarded the country s recurrent searches for submarine violations of its territorial integrity.

In 1982, Sweden claimed that it had recordings from a Soviet submarine in the waters of the Stockholm archipelago.
The recording was made during a submarine hunt by the Swedish military on October 12th, 1982.
Just a year before the recording was made, in October 1981, the Russian diesel Submarine W-137 got stuck on an underwater rock about a mile from the Swedish main Naval Base at Karlskrona.
After days of negotiations between Moscow and Stockholm, the master on the Russian Submarine was summoned ashore for a hearing.
Nowadays, the Swedish Defence Research Agency  FOI  was determined to find whether the sound on the 1982 tape came from a submarine or surface vessel’s propeller.
Back in 1982 the incident resulted in Operation Notvarp, the most advanced known secret submarine hunting operation ever undertaken by Sweden’s Armed Forces.
During the operation, all of Sweden s submarine hunting forces concentrated in one location following a number of suspected intrusions.
This “submarine fishing” operation implied trapping a presumed foreign submarine and forcing it to the surface by dropping depth charges.
Not a single submarine surfaced as a result.
Soon after the operation finished, Sweden launched a special submarine commission which in the spring of 1983 concluded that the USSR was behind the intrusions.
After spending a week scouring the waters off Stockholm for a reportedly Russian submarine, the Swedish Navy has given up.
On Friday, the country s military reported that the vessel  or vessels  in question have left the Stockholm archipelago and that the intelligence operation, as military officials had insisted on calling it, would be coming to an end.
During the last week, Swedish vessels have searched in futility for a Russian submarine while sightings of the submarine have streamed in from the public.
In announcing the search s end, however, Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said that the military had ruled out the presence of a large, more ordinary-sized submarine.
The vessel, he said, had been spotted in area too shallow for a larger vessel to operate in, indicating that the submarine in question is of a smaller variety.
We say with confidence that this is not a larger, conventional submarine,  Grenstad said .
What evidence the Swedish military has collected on the submarine remains unknown, but it is all but certain that its military intelligence units know more than Grenstad is publicly letting on.
And the country s decommissioned anti-submarine warfare helicopters turned out to have been stashed away in a museum.
The Swedish military captured just one Soviet submarine -- and only because it ran aground.
During the Cold War, especially in the 1980s, the Soviet navy carried out a series of aggressive submarine operations in Sweden s coastal waters.
These incursions dropped off with the end of the Cold War, but with Russia s newly aggressive military posture toward the West, particularly against countries that during the Cold War served as a buffer between mother Russia and NATO, it should come as no surprise that Moscow s underwater adventures in the Stockholm archipelago have also made a comeback.
Swedish armed forces involved in the search off Stockholm.
Hiding a submarine off the shores of a foreign capital might seem a tall order, especially when you have helicopters, ships and 200 troops on your trail.
Sweden’s military has spent three days scouring the waters off Stockholm for what has so far been officially described only as “foreign underwater activity”.
However, intelligence briefings to local newspapers suggest a Russian submarine might have had mechanical problems while on a secret mission in the region.
In scenes reminiscent of the 1970s and 80s – when neutral Sweden regularly hunted for Soviet spy submarines in the Baltic Sea around the capital – 200 service personnel were mobilised along with helicopters, minesweepers and an anti-submarine corvette fitted with stealth-type anti-radar masking.
The operation began late on Friday following what Sweden’s armed forces said was a reliable tipoff about something in the Stockholm archipelago, which has 30,000 islands and rocky outcrops around which a submarine could lurk.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper said it was believed the intruder was a Russian submarine or mini-submarine that may have been damaged.
One was in the waters off Stockholm, while the other could be traced to Kaliningrad, the port that is the home of Russia’s Baltic Sea fleet.
Defence analysts cited in other reports speculated that a submarine might have been replacing old spy equipment or monitoring a Swedish naval exercise.
Last week Finland complained that the Russian navy had twice harassed one of its environmental research ships in international waters, ordering it to change course and later sending a helicopter and submarine to pass close by.
The submarine hunt is an early political test for Stefan Löfven, Sweden’s new prime minister, whose centre-left minority government took office this month.
Details remain sketchy, but something is clearly afoot off the coast of Stockholm Sweden, where a large search and intelligence operation is underway involving ships, from small riverine craft to stealthy Visby Class Corvettes, aircraft and over 200 operators.
Something of great interest is under the water, and it may be a Russian submarine in trouble.
However, Swedish intelligence agencies were able to get a ballpark idea of where it was coming from and where the source on the other end s location wasâ€”which turned out to be off the Swedish coast near Stockholm and around Kaliningrad, the home of Russia s Baltic fleet.
Some speculate the ship could be supporting a clandestine mission potentially having to do with the submarine in question.
Russian Submarine mishaps are not unheard of in the area, the famous  Whisky On The Rocks  incident of 1981 being the most notable, during which a geriatric Russian Whisky Class attack sub ran aground in Swedish waters.
As for Russia s Baltic fleet submarine forces, they include a handful of diesel-electric Kilo Class subs, which are capable in littoral environments, and one very advanced Lada Class submarine.
The only one of its type and the most advanced diesel submarine in the entire Russian Navy, the Saint Petersburg features air-independent propulsion  AIP , allowing it to stay submerged for far longer than traditional diesel-electric submarines and is thought to be the quietest submarine in the entire Russian Navy.

A new report says Sweden intercepted distress calls from the Russian sub and even spotted it breaking the surface just 50 miles from Stockholm.

The Swedish armed forces announced a large military operation around islands off Stockholm late Friday following reports of suspicious  foreign underwater activity .
STOCKHOLM, Oct 18  Reuters  - Sweden beefed up its military  presence in the Stockholm archipelago on Saturday to scour its  waters for  foreign underwater activity,  a mobilization of  Swedish ships, troops and helicopters unseen since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 30 miles  50 km  from  Stockholm began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final  years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly hunted suspected  Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
Ships, helicopters and troops from an amphibious unit as  well as the home guard combed the search area in Stockholm s  archipelago.
The forces include HMS Visby, a corvette that has  stealth technology and equipment for anti-submarine warfare.
The Swedish military said on Friday there had been no armed  intervention and declined to comment on who might be responsible  for the suspicious activity, or whether the report had been  about a submarine.
In 1981, a Soviet submarine known under its Swedish  designation U137 was stranded deep inside Swedish waters not far  from a major naval base in the neutral country, sparking intense  suspicion about the scale and motives of such incursions.
Stockholm  AFP  - The Swedish armed forces stepped up a military operation off the coast of Stockholm on Saturday where they were investigating a report of  foreign underwater activity .
I have decided to increase the number of units in the area -- units with specialised sensors,  Commander Jonas Wikstroem told reporters at a press conference in Stockholm.
We still judge that the information we received yesterday was very trustworthy,  he added, but declined to comment on what the military had discovered after more than 24 hours sweeping the sea around islands in Stockholm s archipelago.
Swedish defence analysts cited by local media speculated that a foreign submarine may have been in the area to replace old spy equipment or to monitor a Swedish naval exercise.
During the 1980s and early 90s the then-neutral -- and now non-aligned -- Nordic country was regularly on alert following Russian submarine sightings, including one notable case in 1981 when a Soviet U-boat ran aground several miles from one of Sweden s largest naval base.

STOCKHOLM  AP  - Sweden s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.
In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.
Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday, just 40 kilometers  25 miles  west of Stockholm amid the myriad of islands and skerries that stretch from the capital into the Baltic Sea.
Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but stressed that unlike Sweden s submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn t using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.
Daily Svenska Dagbladet has reported that Swedish intelligence picked up distress signals suggesting a Russian mini-submarine had run into trouble in Swedish waters and could be damaged.
Countering such claims, a Russian Defense Ministry official quoted by the Tass news agency suggested that the search was triggered by a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week.
The Dutch navy, in turn, said that submarine left Sweden on Thursday and had been in Estonia since early Friday.
In Sweden, Armed Forces spokesman Philip Simon said the Dutch submarine was not what triggered the Swedish search.
In the final decade of the Cold War, Sweden launched a series of unsuccessful submarine hunts after a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off its southeastern coast in 1981.
The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even speculated that the submarine hunt could be a ploy by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget, which has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War.
The official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all, noting the Swedes hadn t found anything.
The submarine scare in Sweden comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow s growing assertiveness in the Baltic Sea region.
However, a submarine sneaking into another country s territorial waters would be much more serious than muscle-flexing maneuvers in the air, Christiansson said.

A Russian bid to blame a Dutch submarine for the reports was quickly dismissed.
The source added:  Last week, a Dutch diesel-electric submarine - Bruinvis - was completing some practical tasks in the immediate vicinity of Stockholm.
But the Dutch have denied this, with a ministry spokesman saying the submarine  was definitely not Dutch .
The admiral said of the sightings:  It could be a submarine, or a smaller submarine.
He said the military was not on a  submarine hunt, using weapons to combat an opponent , and said at present the military was simply engaged in an intelligence operation.
Several blogs and online forums in Russia today expressed fears over the 175-metre long Dmitri Donskoi nuclear submarine, one of the largest in the world, even though reports from Stockholm specified a mini-sub.
One Russian petty officer urged people to take the incident seriously, saying:  I remember so well how it was with the Kursk submarine.
And that encrypted radio traffic from a point in the Stockholm archipelago and Kaliningrad were also later picked up.
One was in the waters off Stockholm, while the other could be traced to Kaliningrad, the port that is the home of Russia s Baltic Sea fleet.
It has been suggested that the tankers movements could be connected to the submarine search.

Sweden has called off the search for a suspected foreign submarine in the Stockholm archipelago.
In the biggest anti-submarine search operation since the end of the Cold War, the military had scanned land, sea and air for signs of the vessel.
The hunt started on 17 October after the military received what it described as credible reports of “foreign underwater activities” between the islands that extend from Stockholm into the Baltic Sea.
This amateur photo released by the Swedish military shows a  man-made object  in the water that sparked the hunt Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad, deputy chief of joint operations, told BBC News: “If we find the submarine the captain of the ship has the possibility to use weapons to get it to stop whatever it is doing.

Who dosen t remember in 1981 outside Karlskrona when the russian submarine U-137  hit aground also called ”Whisky on the rocks”.
In October 1981, the Russian Submarine W-137 accidently navigated on an underwater rock about  2 km from the Swedish main Naval Base at Karlskrona.
As a result of negotiations between the Kremlin and the Swedish Goverment,  the master on the Russian Submarine was taken ashore for a hearing.
The submarine was released to the Russian.
In one instance, a new Swedish Submarine was being tested for speed and sound.
Believing the equipment was malfunctioning, the Submarine was ordered to surface immediately.
Upon surfacing, an intruding huge submarine passed 20 cm under the keel of the Swedish sub, at about 20 knots!
The intruding Sub had followed the Swedish during the speed test and had not realised that the Swedish submarine had surfaced.
This particular incident caused a full alarm as the speed tests had taken place near the Stockholm Naval Base.
But the intruding submarine remained in Swedish waters for another two weeks.
On another occasion, small trawlers operating in southern Baltic waters near Gothenburg caught a  submarine in their net and were dragged backwards below surface by the Sub’s powerful engines.
The submarine also carried a man with a considerably higher rank than the Captain and the man presented himself as passenger and navigation expert.
W-137 had not sent any distress call and Sweden did not accepted the submarine s emergancy claim.

The Swedish Navy is poking around the waters of the Stockholm archipelago after a mysterious submarine was sighted three times in the surrounding area over the past several days.
A Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson has already pointed a finger at the Netherlands; a Dutch submarine was conducting annual exercises near Stockholm last week.
But that submarine left for Estonia on Thursday, before the other mystery vessel had been sighted.
It is thought that this object could be the top of a submarine.
The Dutch have reportedly denied that their submarine is in Swedish territory.

Sweden’s Armed Forces received reports of two further sightings as it continued to search for foreign vessels in waters near Stockholm amid media speculation a damaged Russian submarine was seeking to evade capture.
The most recent sightings bring the total to five as the army searches both on water and land “for something or someone,” Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad, the deputy chief of operations at the Swedish Armed Forces, said on Tuesday at a press conference in Stockholm.
A 27-year-old Swede who spotted and photographed the vessel, whose photo was later published by the Armed Forces, told newspaper Aftonbladet there could be no doubt it was a submarine.
Swedish prime minister Stefan Loefven said the search was being extended southwards to the open sea about 70 kilometres south-east of Stockholm, and more military exercises were being carried out in the Baltic Sea.
There is no submarine hunt underway, there is an ongoing intelligence gathering operation,  Mr Loefven said.
My conclusion from this is that it s probably a Russian mini-submarine - one or more.
The Swedish Armed Forces first launched a major search mission off the coast of Stockholm on Friday after receiving information, reportedly from a civilian, about underwater activity in the region.
A distress signal in Russian preceded the submarine alert in the archipelago of Stockholm.
This indicates that there could be a damaged russian submarine in Swedish waters.

A large military operation is under way in waters off Stockholm to sweep for a “foreign underwater activity” widely speculated to be a damaged Russian submarine, in what could be the gravest violation of Sweden’s maritime sovereignty since the Cold War.
The intelligence operation, involving helicopters, minesweepers, corvettes, fast-attack crafts, a submarine and 200 service personnel, started on Friday, after a “man-made device” was sighted deep inside the Stockholm archipelago and encrypted radio communication was intercepted between that position and Kaliningrad — the base of Russia’s Baltic Sea fleet.
Sweden’s military said Sunday it had made a total of three credible sightings within two days and released an image taken by a passerby showing a partially submerged object, but has yet to comment on whether it is a Russian submarine.
Intelligence expert Joakim von Braun told the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter that the spotted object could be an advanced mini submarine of the model Triton-NN, and that the stranded crew could have hidden themselves on one of the many nearby islands while waiting to be picked up.
Tomas Ries, a researcher at the Swedish National Defense College, says it would be a serious violation if a Russian submarine were located this far into Swedish waters.
The Swedish navy has stepped up its search in the waters off Stockholm amid suspicions that a Russian submarine might be in trouble there.
A Swedish source told the BBC an underwater vessel was spotted in waters about 25km  16 miles  from Stockholm.
It said a Dutch submarine might have triggered Sweden s alert after carrying out exercises in the area.
It was definitely not a Dutch submarine,  a ministry spokeswoman in The Hague told the BBC.
It denied looking for a submarine, and said that it was conducting an intelligence operation.
It also released a grainy photograph showing an object in the sea near Stockholm, although it was not clear what the object was.
He said he doubted the incident could have been a navigating error, as the Stockholm archipelago is a difficult area to navigate.
Soviet submarine sightings during the Cold War caused security alerts in Sweden in the 1980s.
Swedish radio says the search area has expanded to include more islands out into the Baltic, further away from Stockholm.
Swedish news website The Local says vessels and troops have been deployed from Moeja, north of Stockholm, to Ornoe, south of the capital, using sensors in an operation  continuing day and night .

Sweden called off a week-long hunt for a suspected foreign vessel in the Stockholm archipelago, ending its biggest naval mobilization since the Cold War .
The search was stopped after failing to find clear evidence, Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad, deputy chief of operations at the Swedish Armed Forces, said today at a press conference in Stockholm.
The military has “with confidence” excluded that it was a “conventional submarine” because of the water depth where observations were made and will study the sightings and underwater recordings further, he said.
As local media speculated the vessel was a damaged Russian submarine, the navy has refrained from commenting on its origins.
Sweden’s mobilization was the largest since the Cold War days when it frequently conducted submarine hunts along its Baltic Sea coast and comes amid a backdrop of rising tensions between Europe and Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.
In 1981, the Soviet submarine U-137 ran aground near the naval base of Karlskrona in southern Sweden, stoking a decade of submarine alarms until the Soviet Union ’s collapse.

Swedish Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said the armed forces were carrying out an intelligence operation to observe underwater activity in the Stockholm archipelago area, but declined to give details.
It could be a submarine, or a smaller submarine.

Civilian vessels had been ordered by the federal government to stay clear out of the waters of the Stockholm archipelago.
A no-fly zone has likewise been implemented as the Swedish military continue to scour from both air and water the mysterious  foreign  submarine which is believed to be of Russia ownership.
The search for the alleged Russian submarine started on Friday, kicked off when Swedish intelligence authorities reported picking up an emergency radio call in Russian, the English-language Web site The Local reported, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet .
It was a distress call being sent to Kaliningrad, 330 miles  530 kilometres  south of Stockholm on the Baltic s southern shore, The Local report said.
The Russian submarine s alleged incursion into Swedish waters has alarmed the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The Local likewise reported the presence of the NS Concord, a Russian-owned oil tanker, which had been observed circling in international waters near Stockholm.

STOCKHOLM — Sweden’s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.
In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.
Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday, just 25 miles west of Stockholm.
Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said that more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but he stressed that, unlike Sweden’s submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn’t using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.
The daily Svenska Dagbladet has reported that Swedish intelligence picked up distress signals suggesting a Russian mini-submarine had run into trouble in Swedish waters.
Countering such claims, a Russian Defense Ministry official quoted by the Tass news agency suggested that the search was triggered by a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week.
The Dutch navy, in turn, said that submarine left Sweden on Thursday and had been in Estonia since Friday.
In the final decade of the Cold War, Sweden launched unsuccessful submarine hunts after a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off its southeastern coast in 1981.
The official Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper questioned whether there was any submarine, noting that the Swedes hadn’t found anything.
The submarine scare comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow’s growing regional assertiveness.

NEW SUBMARINE!
Swedish navy corvette HMS Visby patrols in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden, Sunday Oct.
Anders Grenstad said the armed forces had observed the activity in the Stockholm archipelago and nearby coastal area, but declined to give details of an operation reminiscent of the Cold War, when Sweden s armed forces routinely hunted for Soviet submarines in its waters.
Grenstad said it had no information about any emergency messages suggesting a Russian mini-submarine had run into trouble in Swedish waters and could be damaged, as reported by the Svenska Dagbladet daily.
Media reports said the movements of the Liberian-flagged tanker might be connected to the submarine search.
In 1981, a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off Sweden s southeastern coast, causing an 11-day diplomatic standoff before Swedish authorities allowed the submarine to return home.

STOCKHOLM  AP  — Sweden calls off weeklong search for suspected submarine in Stockholm archipelago.
Over the weekend, while the world was focusing on the threat of Ebola contagion in the US and around the globe, Sweden s otherwise sleepy capital Stockholm found itself the location of a blitz military operation involving the Swedish Armed Forces, Navy, Army and Air Force, when late on Saturday, Swedish armed forces stepped up an operation -- involving more than 200 men, stealth ships, minesweepers and helicopters -- in an area about 50 kilometres  30 miles  east of the Swedish capital.
Also on Saturday evening, Director Communication and Public Affairs of the Swedish Armed Forces Erik Lagersten said:  At the moment we are conducting an intelligence operation in the archipelago of Stockholm with optical reconnaissance as well as with naval vessels equipped with qualified underwater sensors.
And while it has been neither confirmed nor denied, a media report by the respected Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet , put the blame for the rapid mobilization on what it said was a damaged Russian submarine located just off Stockholm.
The report said that Swedish military intelligence had intercepted radio signals between an area off the coast of Stockholm and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad -- home to much of Russia s Baltic Sea naval fleet.
Over 14 years ago, in August 2000 the Kursk, a Russian nuclear submarine, sank in the Barents Sea killing the entire crew of 118.

Last time Swedish army navy went ruski-sub-hunting in the Stockholm archipelago, it turned out being a false flag.
Swedish authorities shut down airspace above Stockholm on Monday, as they continued searching for a mystery foreign vessel that was sighted repeatedly off the coast of the Swedish capital last week.
Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported on Saturday that the search began last Thursday, after Swedish intelligence detected a number of Russian-language emergency radio signals, which were sent from the vicinity of the port of Stockholm to Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave located on the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania.
On Sunday, the Swedish Ministry of Defense confirmed the search for the vessel, though it refused to speculate on the national origin of its crew and refrained from calling it a submarine.
But a grainy surveillance photograph issued by the Ministry appears to show a submarine of considerable size —said to be Russian— peeking out of the waters of the Baltic Sea, at a location believed to be 30 nautical miles from Stockholm.
One English-language Swedish newspaper quoted Johan Wiktorin, a fellow at the Swedish Royal Academy of War Sciences, who suggested three possible reasons for foreign submarine activity in Sweden’s territorial waters near Stockholm.
On Monday, however, intense speculation appeared in local media about a fourth potential reason for the mystery submarine activity in Swedish territorial waters.
The image was purportedly taken by a local man at around the time when the submarine was sighted in the area.
The theory goes that the mystery submarine’s task was to either “pick up or drop off a Russian spy” without alerting Swedish authorities.
A Russian government spokesman said on Sunday that the alleged submarine might be a Dutch underwater vessel that was believed to be engaged in naval exercises in the region in the days before the sightings.
STOCKHOLM — Sweden called off a week-long hunt for a suspected foreign vessel in the waters of the Stockholm archipelago, ending its biggest naval mobilization since the Cold War.

A source at the Russian Defence ministry earlier told TASS in the wake of reports of an allegedly disabled submarine the search was unsuccessful because there was none.
The official urged Sweden to pay attention to the Dutch diesel-electric submarine Bruinvis, which last week practiced various manoeuvres, including emergency surfacing, near Stockholm.
Photos of that submarine were leaked to the Swedish press.

The Netherlands has denied reports from Russia that the source could be a Dutch naval submarine.
For Swedes, the affair evokes memories of 1981, when a Soviet submarine known by its Swedish designation U137 was stranded near a major naval base deep inside Swedish waters.

Later there can be a situation where it becomes a submarine hunt.
Bruce Jones, from IHS-Jane s suggested that there was a possibility for a small submarine to have run aground.
According to him, the the submarine was likely to be short range and very small, hence the need for a mother vessel.
The intelligence analyst Joakim von Braun, said there was a chance that the submarine s soldiers had abandoned it and swum ashore.

Besides the possible submarine, Russian planes have violated Swedish and Finnish airspace in recent months.
The submarine hunt is something of a baptism by fire for prime minister Stefan Lofven, who has been criticised for lacking international political experience.
Newspapers are full of eyewitness accounts, fuzzy cell-phone pictures of purported submarine sightings or mysterious black-clad figures popping up on island beaches.
Many recalled earlier Swedish submarine incidents, including one 33 years ago this month, when a fisherman out early one morning discovered a Soviet submarine  armed with nuclear torpedoes  that had run aground.
After days of questioning the crew, and chilly diplomatic exchanges between Stockholm and Moscow, the Swedes allowed the sub to go home.
Still, the submarine hunt plays into an increasing Swedish anxiety over security.

Sweden released the grainy photo of a mysterious vessel in Stockholm s archipelago, as the military hunted for a foreign submarine or divers in the country s biggest such mobilization since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 30 miles  50 km  from Stockholm began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly sought out suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.

The hunt for a possible Russian submarine operating clandestinely in Swedish waters might sound familiar to those of us who lived through the Cold War: That s because it bears striking similarities to a 1981 incident that made international headlines and proved a major embarrassment for Soviet authorities.
Late Sunday the country s navy presented a grainy picture of what appeared to be some kind of craft moving among the islands of the Stockholm archipelago, which stretches some 80 kilometers east of the capital.
Even so, The Associated Press says  the submarine search sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region, where Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea and air in recent months.
The grounding of that submarine, U137, on rocks off the Swedish town of Karlskrona 33 years ago led to a standoff between Stockholm and Moscow,  WSJ writes.
Sweden s then Prime Minister Thorbjorn Falldin issued a now famous order to the Swedish military to  hold the border  as Soviet ships approached to support the stricken submarine, which was ultimately escorted back out to international waters.
So, why would a Russian submarine want to be snooping around Sweden in 2014?

Sweden s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge, with Latvia s foreign minister calling the incident a potential  game changer  in the region.
STOCKHOLM – The Swedish navy stepped up its hunt Monday for a suspected foreign submarine in its waters with fingers pointing at Moscow in a throwback to the Cold War.
Swedish soldiers and sailors were scouring the sea southeast of Stockholm in the biggest operation of its kind for years, while the public was warned for the first time to keep a distance and airspace restrictions were enforced.
