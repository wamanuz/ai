This article is about the war in Afghanistan from 2001 onwards.
For the previous phases of this conflict, see War in Afghanistan  1978–present  .
For other wars, see War in Afghanistan .
The War in Afghanistan  2001–present  refers to the intervention by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  NATO  and allied forces in the ongoing Afghan civil war .
The war followed the September 11 attacks , and its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and denying it a safe basis of operation in Afghanistan   by removing the Taliban from power.
As of 2013, tens of thousands of people had been killed in the war.
In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in a coup by Afghan s Communist Party , his former partner in government, known as the People s Democratic Party of Afghanistan  PDPA .
The entry of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its Cold War rivals, the United States , Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan .
The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as   Afghan Arabs  , including Osama bin Laden .
After the withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan in May 1989, the PDPA regime under Najibullah held on until 1992, when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum cleared the approach to Kabul .
The United States  interest in Afghanistan also diminished.

In early 2001, Massoud, with other ethnic leaders, addressed the European Parliament in Brussels, asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan.
On 9 September 2001, Massoud was critically wounded in a suicide attack by two Arabs posing as journalists, who detonated a bomb hidden in their video camera during an interview in Khoja Bahauddin, in the Takhar Province of Afghanistan.

The State Department, in a memo dated 14 September, demanded that the Taliban surrender all known al-Qaeda associates in Afghanistan, provide intelligence on bin Laden and his affiliates and expel all terrorists from Afghanistan.
The same day, a grand council of over 1,000 Muslim clerics from across Afghanistan that had convened to decide bin Laden s fate, issued a fatwa , expressing sadness for the deaths in the 9 11 attacks, urging bin Laden to leave their country and calling on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to conduct an independent investigation of  recent events to clarify the reality and prevent harassment of innocent people .

Many would argue that the story of how 9 11 came about goes back, at least, to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, with which it shares a border.
Subsequent coups reflected struggles within Afghanistan among factions with different ideas about how Afghanistan should be governed and whether it should be communist, and with degrees warmth toward the Soviet Union.
At that time, the Soviet Union and the United States were engaged in the Cold War, a global competition for the fealty of other nations.
The United States was, thus, deeply interested in whether the Soviet Union would succeed in establishing a communist government loyal to Moscow in Afghanistan.
The war in Afghanistan continues taking and destroying lives, both due to the direct consequences of violence and the war-induced breakdown of public health, security, and infrastructure.
Hospitals in Afghanistan are treating large numbers of war wounded, including amputees and burn victims.

Afghanistan was poor and vulnerable before the war that began in 2001; its population remains poor and vulnerable.
The prior wars and civil conflict in the country have made Afghan society extremely vulnerable to the indirect effects of the current war.
The war related indirect deaths in Afghanistan are caused by many factors, including disease due to lack of clean drinking water, malnutrition, and reduced access to health care.
Environmental disasters, such as drought and floods, make living in war zones more difficult, and create what the humanitarian relief community calls  complex emergencies.
Nearly every factor that is associated with premature death — poverty, malnutrition, poor sanitation, lack of access to health care, environmental degradation — is exacerbated by the current war.
While Afghanistan has benefited from investments in health care that may ameliorate some of the effects of war, claims of significant strides in health and healthcare have been called into question.
Despite gains in health care due to Afghan and international humanitarian assistance, the health care crisis remains acute and is exacerbated by war.

Gallup first asked Americans about the Vietnam War in late August early September 1965, with 24% saying military involvement there was a mistake.
And it took just a year and three months from the March 2003 start of the Iraq war for a plurality of Americans to first say involvement there was a mistake, although opinions about that war fluctuated until late 2005, after which they were more consistently negative.
Republicans and independents who lean Republican are significantly less likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say the war in Afghanistan was a mistake.
Therefore, Republicans  higher levels of support may be related to a Republican president s initiation of the war, or an ideological inclination to support military involvement.
Afghanistan has become America s longest war, stretching over 12 years since U.
Americans were initially more supportive of involvement in Afghanistan than they were for any recent major military intervention.
But Americans  waning patience with the conflict has finally reached the point at which Americans are as likely to say the war was a mistake as to say it was not.
The Obama administration plans to draw down the number of troops in Afghanistan significantly by the end of this year.
Once that happens, and the war essentially ends, Americans  assessments of whether intervention was a mistake will largely depend on the political course Afghanistan takes, including whether terrorist cells are able to regroup there.
Gallup research conducted in Afghanistan shows that Afghans rate their lives as poorly on several dimensions as residents of any country in the world.

Iranian photographer Majid Saeedi has won the 2014 FotoEvidence Book Award for his project Life in War.
This project focused exclusively on the people whose lives have been crushed by the war in Afghanistan over a10-year period.
Svetlana Bachevanova, publisher of FotoEvidence, announced the release of Life in War, saying: “Majid’s work is in the best tradition of humanistic photography.
His images show us the humanity of people who have endured decades of war.
Life in War is probably the only book about Afghanistan that isn’t just filled with images of conflict.
Saeedi photographed daily life in the context of war.
Afghanistan has been dealing with war for 50 years,” says Saeedi.
Intentionally or locally, the Afghans are people of war and bloodshed.
For the past 40 years, Afghanistan has been involved in various wars and conflict.
After the war with the Soviet Union, communists seized power in the country.
Later, they in turn became another cause of strife, this time in the civil war between al-Qaida and the country’s regular civilians.
Saeedi said he was tempted to photograph war on the front line, but instead remained with the people.
I decided to concentrate my work on Afghan people’s life,” says Saeedi, “as the women, men and kids are the main victims of war and they were not seen anywhere.
War is not the only thing going on in Afghanistan,” says Saeedi.
There is a paradox between the tranquility of eastern culture and the violence of war.
Despite the poverty, drug addiction, lack of education, life goes on in Afghanistan and people continue to live with hope for a better tomorrow.
Afghans are trying their best to start each day without war and bloodshed but this is not possible unless all nations are united, power is divided between them and all of them are educated,” says Saeedi.
Decades of conflict have made tallying Afghanistan’s war-related amputees — the victims of land mines, unexploded ordnance and roadside bombs — essentially impossible, health officials say.
Socially and financially, their lives are destroyed,” Emanuele Nannini, program director at the Italian nonprofit Emergency, which operates health-care centers across Afghanistan, said of Afghan amputees.
From January to June this year, Emergency’s Center for War Trauma Victims in Lashkar Gah , the capital of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, performed 69 amputations.
The ICRC said that between April and June this year, it admitted 351 amputee patients to its facilities across Afghanistan.

President Barack Obama delivers remarks regarding Afghanistan to the press in the Rose Garden of the White House, May 27, 2014.
This afternoon, in the White House Rose Garden, President Obama talked briefly about the United States  next steps in Afghanistan, and how  we will bring America s longest war to a responsible end.
We remain committed to a sovereign, secure, stable, and unified Afghanistan.
We have to recognize that Afghanistan will not be a perfect place, and it is not America’s responsibility to make it one.
The future of Afghanistan must be decided by Afghans.
At least 17,316 American soldiers have been wounded in the Afghanistan war theater since Obama was inaugurated for his first term, according to a count maintained by the U.
OEF is the official name of the Afghanistan war theater, which also involves military operations in Guantanamo Bay  Cuba , Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Seychelles, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.
Most, just about all, OEF-related activity has taken place in Afghanistan.
An estimated 90 percent of all the soldiers who have been wounded in the Afghanistan theater received their injuries after Obama was sworn into office for his first term on January 20, 2009.
Restrictive Rules of Engagement  ROA  in combination with other aspects of Obama s military strategy have been accused of fueling a rise in fatalities and injuries in Afghanistan since the president took office.
A February 2014 report from the Congressional Research Service   CRS   revealed that as of the end of 2013, a total of 762 “major limb” amputations were traced to the Afghanistan theater.
Tuesday marks the 13th anniversary of the war in Afghanistan–America’s longest war.
Unfortunately for Afghans, and their neighbors affected by the withdrawal, the war all but promises to continue–indefinitely.
Last weekend, the Afghan government issued an ominous invitation to the Taliban: With foreign troops leaving, insurgents should end their war on the Afghan state and unite with Kabul against more serious “external”  read: Pakistani  threats.
Pakistani anti-India militants fighting in Afghanistan–including Lashkar-e-Taiba–could respond to the departure of foreign troops by redirecting their attention, and attacks, to India.
Nonetheless, this much is clear: Even if the war in Afghanistan is ending for U.

President Obama responsibly ended the war in Iraq and will end the war in Afghanistan in 2014.
President Barack Obama made a surprise visit to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan over Memorial Day weekend to thank the American troops stationed there.
In an announcement from the White House Rose Garden on May 27, Obama affirmed his plan to formally conclude the combat mission in Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
This year we will bring America s longest war to a responsible end,  he said.
There are currently 32,000 troops in Afghanistan; military commanders recommend leaving 10,000 troops after the end of combat operations.
By the beginning of 2015, about 9,800 troops would be stationed around Afghanistan.
There s a hurdle to cross, though: This withdrawal schedule will only occur if Obama and Afghanistan s new president -- to be elected in two weeks -- sign a bilateral agreement allowing for transition process.
Obama visited Afghanistan in 2012, when he was unsuccessful in reaching a strategic partnership agreement with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
On May 28, Obama delivered the commencement address at West Point military academy where he placed his plans for Afghanistan in the context of broader foreign policy.
Sustaining the progress made in Afghanistan depends on the ability of Afghans to independently defend themselves, said Obama.
Overall, Obama has said he intends to keep his promise to end the war in Afghanistan in 2014.
Secretary of State John Kerry visited Afghanistan recently.
The United States and Afghanistan intend to reach an agreement on how many troops would remain, to train the Afghan military and for counterterrorism.
Meanwhile, the people of Afghanistan go to the polls in April 2014 to elect a new president.
I believe that the security of Afghanistan is growing and will grow over the course of the next two years, and I have confidence that in the bilateral security agreement we will have a full understanding of exactly how that will occur,” Kerry said.
While it is too soon to make decisions about the number of forces that could remain in Afghanistan after 2014, any presence would be at the invitation of the Afghan Government and focused on two distinct missions: training, advising and equipping Afghan forces, and continued counter-terrorism missions against al Qaeda and their affiliates,” Obama said.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also emphasized the 2014 deadline in conversations with troops on March 8 in a visit to Afghanistan.
We are still at war, and many of you will continue to experience the ugly reality of combat and the heat of battle,” Hagel said .
The US-led war in Afghanistan was a response to the September 11 terrorist attacks on America.
The 19 hijackers were members of al-Qaeda, the global Islamist network founded and led by Saudi-born Osama Bin Laden, now living in Afghanistan.
The Taliban, the ruling power in Afghanistan, were accused by the US of protecting Bin Laden.
Taliban requests for negotiations with the US were rejected in favour of military action, and on 7 October 2001 the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom began in Afghanistan.
The aim of Operation Enduring Freedom was to find Osama Bin Laden, remove the Taliban from power, and prevent the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist haven.
Kandahar, the last major Taliban stronghold, fell on 7 December 2001, marking the end of the Taliban s rule in Afghanistan.
They were excluded from the Bonn Agreement that formed a draft constitution for Afghanistan, and in 2004 Hamid Karzai was elected the country s president.
The numbers of Nato troops in Afghanistan grew, but this brought little success.
Although there had initially been broad public support for the war in Afghanistan in the US and UK, polls suggested a falling in confidence as costs spiralled and casualty numbers rose.
On 20 November 2010, Nato announced the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan by 2014.
In June 2011 US President Barack Obama announced that 10,000 US troops would leave Afghanistan by the end of the year, and an additional 23,000 would leave by 2012.
In the UK, prime minster David Cameron pledged to end British combat operations in Afghanistan by 2015.

Tuesday this week commemorates 13 years since the start of the Afghan War â€” America s longest running campaign of its kind â€” yet an end to the operation is hardly on the horizon.
Under the terms of the Bilateral Security Agreement, the pact signed last week by representatives for both   the United States and Afghanistan, the US will significantly   reduce the number of soldiers involved in its post-9 11 Operation   Enduring Freedom at the end of this year.
Troop numbers will   shrink to 10,000, signaling indeed a major step towards ending   the war in Afghanistan â€” a campaign promise made by US President   Barack Obama during the lead-up to his re-election in 2012.
Combined with the only recently concluded war in Iraq, the   financial toll of the Afghan war on Uncle Sam s pocketbook could   range in $4 trillion to $6 trillion, according to research published last year out of Harvard   University.
Additionally, the iCasualties website claims the US military has suffered 2,349 deaths during   Operation Enduring Freedom â€” including 48 this year, or as many   lives lost in that war in 2003 when it was still relatively new.
Even with last week s agreement, however, the Afghan War will   only end in name, if at all.
Under the terms of the pact, the   roughly 9,800 US troops that will remain in Afghanistan past the   end of this year will be cut in half by the end of the next, with   a full-scale withdrawal tentatively slated for the end of 2016.
By keeping US troops overseas for now, the State Department said   recently, Afghanistan, the US and international community at   large will â€œmaintain the partnership we ve established to ensure   Afghanistan maintains and extends the gains of the past decade.
Under the terms of the BSA, US and NATO   troops have already been cleared to stay â€œ until the end of 2024 and beyond ,â€� suggesting   Operation Enduring Freedom could extend for another decade even   after already being America s longest running war.
Thirteen years ago this Tuesday, George W Bush, then the   president of the United States, said the Pentagon had officially begun a mission â€œdesigned to   disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations   and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime.
This military action is a part of our campaign against   terrorism, another front in a war that has already been joined   through diplomacy, intelligence, the freezing of financial assets   and the arrests of known terrorists by law enforcement agents in   38 countries,â€� Bush said from the White House.
That patience is still at play today, however, and has led   Operation Enduring Freedom into the record books of being the   longest-running US war ever.
Now despite campaign promises made   by Obama, even Bush s successor might not see the end of a war in   Afghanistan anytime soon: 13 years after Bush announced the start   of a military operation against terrorists, the US and its allies   are now in the midst of conducting aerial campaign against the   so-called Islamic State, a terrorist organization that even   Al-Qaeda has distanced itself from over concerns involving the   group s violent practices.
If   the Pentagon s numbers don t change drastically over time, than   the cost of fighting that war could come to over $3 billion   annually â€” a fraction of the $77.
Washington  CNN  – Support for the war in Afghanistan has dipped below 20%, according to a new national poll, making the country s longest military conflict arguably its most unpopular one as well.
Just 17% of those questioned say they support the 12-year-long war, down from 52% in December 2008.
Those numbers show the war in Afghanistan with far less support than other conflicts,  CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.
Opposition to the Iraq war never got higher than 69% in CNN polling while U.
Vietnam War was in progress, no more than six in 10 ever told Gallup s interviewers that war was a mistake.
Only a quarter say that America should still have boots on the ground in Afghanistan after that deadline.
America is winning the war in Afghanistan.
Independents have a much gloomier view of the war in Afghanistan than Republicans or Democrats,  Holland said.
That may be because a Republican president started the war and a Democratic president has continued it, so there may be some residual support among people who identify with either party.
Afghanistan since the war began in the autumn of 2001.
Two-thirds of those questioned in an ABC News Washington Post poll said the war has not been worth fighting, and an Associated Press GfK survey showed 57% saying the U.
America s long war in Afghanistan isn t likely to end well, and the American people seem to know it.
Despite a wholly predictable effort to portray the war as an American victory, the United States isn t going to defeat the Taliban between now and the scheduled departure of most U.
In that spirit, here is a list of the top 10 mistakes made in America s Afghan War.
Instead of making Afghanistan a collective project from the start, the Bush administration wanted to show it could do the job all by itself, with an assist from the Afghan Northern Alliance.
By the time NATO got involved big-time, a new civil war was underway and the best opportunity to build a stable Afghanistan had been squandered.
The United States invaded Afghanistan for one reason: to get Osama bin Laden and as many of his followers as possible.
Had we caught him then and there, al Qaeda might have been dealt a fatal blow and the United States could have declared victory in the  war on terror  instead of watching al Qaeda morph into a global franchise.
The Bonn Agreement in December 2001 established an interim government for post-Taliban Afghanistan and was, in many ways, an impressive diplomatic achievement.
The Bush administration s decision to invade Iraq was not just a disaster for Iraq and for the United States, it also diverted military and intelligence resources from Afghanistan and allowed the Taliban to regroup and resume the war.
In the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama burnished his national security street cred by declaring that he was going to end the war in Iraq so that he could focus on the  real war  in Afghanistan.
To succeed, the surge would have had to be far larger and much longer in duration, and Afghanistan simply wasn t worth that level of effort.
The surge also led to a sharp uptick in Afghan and American casualties, which gradually undermined support for the war back home.
Ending the war and building a functioning Afghan government required a reconciliation process that would integrate the more moderate elements of the Taliban back into the Afghan political community.
The American public signed up for that war with enthusiasm, but not to an open-ended effort to transform an impoverished, land-locked, and ethnically divided Muslim country that had never been a vital U.
And neither Bush nor Obama ever managed to persuade them that the war was worth the cost, mostly because the American people aren t completely gullible.
By 2008, the war was costing the American taxpayers an amount several times larger than Afghanistan s entire GDP, and neither Bush nor Obama could come up with a convincing rationale for continuing to pour money and lives into distant strategic backwater.
To be sure, Obama tried to justify the war as necessary to prevent al Qaeda from establishing a  safe haven  again, but al Qaeda already had better havens by 2009 and was barely in Afghanistan by that point.
Moreover, a long and costly war against the Taliban was increasingly a distraction from the broader campaign against al Qaeda itself.
Bottom line: the American people will support a war when vital interests are at stake and there is a plausible theory of victory, but by 2009, neither of those conditions had been met.
Winning the war in Afghanistan depended on getting at least two foreign governments to play ball.
Although many American soldiers fought with skill and heroism, achieving our stated war aims was an uphill battle from the get-go.
And finally, building a new Afghan state and fighting a counterinsurgency war required outsiders to pour billions of dollars into an impoverished country, but the flood of poorly managed money merely fueled corruption and ensured that much of the aid money was wasted .
This may have been Cold War paranoia, but in several cases our Soviet guides dropped something into conversation that it would seem they only could have known from overhearing our private talks.
All this comical hokum came to an abrupt end on the morning when our Sputnik guides presented to us a petition, already signed by patriotic Eastern Bloc youth, calling on the United States to halt the imperialist war in Vietnam.
The anti-war movement was peaking.
Toby, a dancer who I suppose was all of 23, said,  If you guys sign this today, there will be an article next week in the International Herald Tribune with the headline,  Americans Sign Russian Petition Condemning Vietnam War.

Russian war, before the Marxist revolution, Afghanistan used to be a pretty nice place.
Esterson told the Denver Post: “Many Afghans have written comments  showing their appreciation for the photographs that show what their country was like before 33 years of war.
The Afghanistan Project at the Institute for the Study of War produces detailed publications on the changing security and political dynamics in Afghanistan.
Research analysts document the pattern of enemy activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan; military operations by Coalition and Afghan forces; the implications of the drawdown of Surge forces; and the political, economic, and demographic dynamics underlying the conflict.
WikiLeaks today released over 75,000 secret US military reports covering the war in Afghanistan.
The Afghan War Diary is an extraordinary secret compendium of over 91,000 reports covering the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010.
The Afghan War Diary is the most significant archive about the reality of war to have ever been released during the course of a war.
We hope its release will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the war in Afghanistan and provide the raw ingredients necessary to change its course.
However the reports also contain related information from Marines intelligence, US Embassies, and reports about corruption and development activity across Afghanistan.
All incidents have been placed onto a map of Afghanistan and can be viewed on Google Earth limited to a particular window of time or place.
In this way the unfolding of the last six years of war may be seen.
After further review, these reports will be released, with occasional redactions, and eventually, in full, as the security situation in Afghanistan permits.
The Afghan War Diary  AWD for short  consists of messages from several important US military communications systems.
It is best to think of the messages in the terms of an overall collective logbook of the Afghan war.
The Afghanistan time zone is AFT  UTC + 4:30 , which may complicate things further if you are looking up messages based on local time.

This item: Afghanistan: A Distant War by Robert Nickelsberg Hardcover $40.
Noted documentary photographer Robert Nickelsberg s photographs help bring into focus the day-to-day consequences of war, poverty, oppression, and political turmoil in Afghanistan.
This remarkable volume of photographs is accompanied by insightful texts from experts on Afghanistan and the Taliban.
Timely and important, the book serves as a reminder that Afghanistan and the rest of the world remain inextricably linked, no matter how much we long to distance ourselves from its painful realities.
His work in Afghanistan has also appeared on The New York Times  Lens  blog and his images have appeared in Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, CNN, and NBC.
Robert Nickelsberg has been traveling to Afghanistan since the late 1980s as a photojournalist to document the seemingly endless wars that have engulfed that fascinating and unfortunate country.
This book presents a retrospective of Nickelsberg s extraordinary work in Afghanistan, from the final days of the Soviet occupation to the U.
As such, this definitive document captures in images a quarter century of Afghanistan s tumultuous history -- including the haunting portraits of commanders, warlords, drug smugglers, bomb makers, foot soldiers, as well as riveting shots of the ever-present and ever-suffering civilians.
I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in war photography, reportage, Afghanistan, current events and history.
An indispensable addition to collections of photojournalism and libraries on Afghanistan and South Asia.
Aesthetically,  Afghanistan: A Distant War,   is nearly flawless.
Nickelsberg s beautiful photographs; Prestel s elegant design and printing; and Jon Lee Anderson s dead-on Foreword  which should be subtitled  Afghanistan for Dummies   together create a model for war photography books in an era where bound books, especially expensive, large format photography books, are an endangered literary species.
When one reads  Afghanistan  and sits staring at the double page, three-dimensional contrast of shadow and light and the rhythmic synergy of action shots against somber portraiture, it s possible to believe that print photography is not summarily doomed after all.
It supposedly speaks for itself if it captures the  decisive moment  or, in the case of war photography, offers shock value, a bar that seems to get higher by the minute.
Nickelsberg s mettle under extreme circumstances, and they squarely position him in photo critic Susie Linfield s pantheon of acclaimed war photographers.
If you buy just one book on Afghanistan, this is the one.
Robert Nickelsberg brings a whole new meaning to the word commitment with this stunning photography book, covering decades of conflict and life in Afghanistan.
I have spent quite a bit of time in Afghanistan myself, but learned more from this book than from any more academic account.
His coverage of Afghanistan is extensive and very poignant and visually intriguing.
Nickelsberg is one of the last of a vanishing breed of true professionalism in photography and war coverage.
This is a must see book on the long war in the  Stan.
British troops launch one final attack on the Taliban – just hours before the end of combat operations in Afghanistan.
But he insisted: “We are not going to send combat troops back into Afghanistan – we’ve made that clear.
Our forces have been in ­Afghanistan since 2001, just after 9-11.
But after they helped US troops and the Northern Alliance rout the Taliban, the extremists re-emerged in Helmand – Afghanistan’s most unruly province.
Mr Fallon said Britain’s ­involvement in stopping Afghanistan from becoming a “safe haven for terrorism” meant it was “mission accomplished”.
But the Defence Secretary warned: “There is no ­guarantee that Afghanistan is going to be stable and safe.
What I’m saying to you is that we have given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a safer future.
He said: “Britain must make sure that we continue to give the right support to the Afghan government both politically and through humanitarian aid, so that security and stability in Afghanistan can be maintained in the years to come.
Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted last night: “We will always remember the courage of those who served in Afghanistan on our behalf and never forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
At the height of the war, 9,500 troops were spread across Helmand battling daily with the Taliban from 137 bases.
At the centre of the war effort was Camp Bastion – a 1,600 acre military metropolis the size of Reading and home to more than 40,000 people.
Yet while Britain is withdrawing, the war against a battered but potent Taliban continues.

Stretched over a year, the price of the war could be as much as $3.
Pentagon spends on fighting in Afghanistan.
Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, a relative pittance compared with the hundreds of millions it spent fighting every day in Afghanistan in 2013.
The costs in Iraq and Syria will escalate substantially if, as President Obama and Pentagon officials have said, the new war lasts for years, according to military analysts.
In fiscal year 2013, the Pentagon s budget for Operation Enduring Freedom — most all of it spent in Afghanistan — totaled $77.
There are, however, a few price points to consider in the cost of waging war.
Thompson also pointed out that some of the costs in the Middle East are already accounted for in the Pentagon s nearly $500 billion annual budget — war or no war.
The nicest thing you can say about the price-tag for yet another war in the Middle East is that most of the forces being used would have been funded even in peacetime,  Thompson said.
The war cost counters running on the Cost of National Security homepage include all of the funding that has         been appropriated by Congress for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through fiscal year 2014.
Total War Funding: To date, $1.
Iraq and Afghanistan, including $92.
So far, funds for the conflict have come from war funding allocated for Iraq and  or Afghanistan, and are included in spending on those conflicts.
Spending includes only         incremental costs – those additional funds that are expended due to the war.
Potential future costs, such as future medical care for         soldiers and veterans wounded in the war, are not included.
These figures also do not include interest payments         on the national debt that will result from higher deficits due to war spending.
Total war funding, and costs of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, are based on analysis of legislation in which         Congress has allocated money for war, as well as research by the Congressional Research Service.
The cost of military action against ISIS is so far included in the cost of wars against Iraq         and Afghanistan, and the total cost of wars since 2001.
The funds allocated to the war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq in fiscal year 2014 are found in the         Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 that was signed by the president on Jan.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act allocates war funding under the name of Overseas Contingency         Operations  OCO  appropriations to the Department of Defense  DoD , the Department of State, and the         Department of Homeland Security  DHS .
Afghanistan, National Priorities Project has         determined that all remaining OCO funds not explicitly designated for another country should be allocated to         Afghanistan, given that no other major contingency operations are ongoing.
State Department operations in Afghanistan         while $2.
To provide accurate accounting of these undesignated funds, the more detailed Department of State Congressional Budget Justification for fiscal year 2014 was analyzed to determine what         percentages of the total OCO requests were related to Iraq and Afghanistan, respectively.
On the premise         that State Department priorities for fiscal year 2014 operations remained constant between the time that         passed between its budget request and appropriations, these percentages were applied to the total OCO         funds appropriated to the State Department in order to derive country-specific totals for efforts in Iraq         and Afghanistan.
Pakistan are an extension of the war in Afghanistan, National Priorities         Project considered funds allocated towards Pakistan by the State Department to be part of war costs         associated with Afghanistan.
While these funds were not designated for any country-specific         purpose, National Priorities Project counted them towards efforts in Iraq, which unlike Afghanistan maintains         maritime borders.
Recently declassified documents from archives in the former Soviet Union and memoirs of senior Soviet military and political leaders present the complex and tragic story of the ten years of the Soviet military involvement in Afghanistan.
Most observers agree that the last war of the Soviet Union created or aggravated the internal dynamics that eventually culminated in the dissolution of the country itself.
The documents presented here shed light on the most important moments in the history of the Soviet war in Afghanistanthe Afghan governments requests for assistance, the Soviet Unions initial refusal of troops, the reversal of this policy by a small group of the Politburo and the Soviet decision to invade; the expansion of the initial mission to include combat operations against the Afghan resistance; early criticism of the Soviet policy and of the Peoples Democratic party of Afghanistan  PDPA  regime; and the decision to withdraw the troops.
Taken together, these materials suggest some lessons that might be drawn from the Soviet experience of fighting a war in Afghanistan.
KGB reports from Afghanistan created a picture of urgency and strongly emphasized the possibility of Amins links to the CIA and U.
Their analysis of internal social processes in Afghanistan was done through the conceptual lens of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, which blinded the leadership to the realities of traditional tribal society.
Believing that there was no single country in the world, which was not ripe for socialism, party ideologues like Mikhail Suslov and Boris Ponomarev saw Afghanistan as a second Mongolia.
Reports from Afghanistan show the growing awareness of the Islamic factor on the part of Soviet military and political personnel.
The war in Afghanistan had a major impact on domestic politics in the Soviet Union.
The prominent dissident and human rights activist, Academician Andrei Sakharov, publicly denounced the atrocities committed by the Soviet Army in Afghanistan.
The image of the Soviet Army fighting against Islam in Afghanistan also contributed to a rapid rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the Central Asian republics and possibly to the strengthening of the independence movement in Chechnya, both of which continue to pose major security threats to Russia today.
The Soviet Army also quickly realized the inadequacy of its preparation and planning for the mission in Afghanistan.
Then the mission was changed once again, but the leadership was not willing to admit that the Soviet troops were essentially fighting the Afghan civil war for the PDPA.
The notion of the internationalist duty that the Soviet Limited Contingent was fulfilling in Afghanistan was essentially ideological, based on the idea that Soviet troops were protecting the socialist revolution in Afghanistan whereas the experience on the ground immediately undermined such justifications.
The realization that there could be no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan came to the Soviet military leadership very early on.
The issue of troop withdrawal and the search for a political solution was discussed as early as 1980, but no real steps in that direction were taken, and the Limited Contingent continued to fight in Afghanistan without a clearly defined objective.
The main Soviet sources on the decision to intervene in Afghanistan come from the Russian Presidential Archive, the Ministry of Defense Archive and from the published memoirs of Soviet officers and political leaders.
They belong to the following categories:  the minutes of the CC CPSU Politburo discussions, which were declassified by President Yeltsins executive decree in 1992, the KGB and military intelligence reports from Kabul, many of which were published in the influential study The Tragedy and Valor of Afghan by veteran of the Afghan War General Alexander Lyakhovsky, political letters from USSR Ambassadors in Afghanistan to the Soviet Foreign Ministry from the Russian Foreign Ministry Archives, memoranda of conversations of the Soviet Ambassadors and other leaders with their Afghan counterparts found in the Center for Preservation of Contemporary Documentation in Moscow, analytical letters to the Central Committee and the military leadership also found in the Center for Preservation of Contemporary Documentation.
Among the most important memoirs on the Soviet war in Afghanistan are those by former Deputy USSR Foreign Minister Georgy M.
Kornienko and the last Commander of the Soviet Limited Contingent of Forces in Afghanistan, General Boris Gromov.
Some of the most important documents on the Soviet War in Afghanistan were published in the English translation in the Cold War International History Project Bulletin, No.
The documents presented below provide an insight into some of the most important aspects of the Soviet decision making on the Afghan war from the decision to send in the troops to the decision to withdraw the Soviet Limited Contingent.
In the telephone conversation with Afghan Prime Minister Taraki, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin explains to his Afghan counterpart that the Soviet Union would not send troops, and encourages Taraki to rely on the local population, and specifically to mobilize industrial workers of the Herat province, which shows the lack of understanding of the local situation on the part of the Soviet leadership  industrial workers, the proletariat, which was supposed to be the base of the socialist revolution were practically non-existent in Afghanistan .
The Politburo session, convened urgently to discuss the situation in Herat, shows the differences of opinion among the participants: while practically all Politburo members were against sending Soviet troops to Afghanistan, some of them at the same time argued that we cannot lose Afghanistan.
Brezhnev was that economic and military assistance with equipment and advisers would be provided but no Soviet troops would be sent to Afghanistan.

The Politburo sessions of January 17 and 28, 1980 carried extensive discussions of the situation in Afghanistan.
Lyakhovsky and other authors report that at the same time, the top Soviet military and political leadership held secret deliberations on the possibility of early withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan.
The letter of Pravda correspondent Schedrov to the CC CPSU of November 12, 1981 reflects early criticism of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan along with a realization of the inadequacy of a military solution.
This report prepared by the KGB USSR and the General Staff states that the Soviet Commander of the Turkmen Military District and the Main Soviet Adviser in Afghanistan were given orders to capture an American citizen working with the mujahedeen.
At the Politburo session of October 17, 1985, General Secretary Gorbachev proposed to make a final decision on Afghanistan and quoted from citizens letters regarding the dissatisfaction in the country with the Soviet actions in Afghanistan.

The first serious Politburo discussion of the need to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan, which included the testimony of Marshal Sergei Akhromeev is reflected in the Minutes of November 13, 1986.
Gorbachev return to the issue of the need to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan several times.
Criticism of the Soviet policy of national reconciliation in Afghanistan and analysis of general failures of the Soviet military mission there is presented in Colonel Tsagolovs letter to USSR Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov of August 13, 1987.
This letter represents the first open criticism of the Afghan war from within the military establishment.
On May 10, 1988, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR issued a closed  internal use  letter to all Communist Party members of the Soviet Union on the issue of withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
The letter presents the Central Committee analysis of events in Afghanistan and Soviet actions in that country, the problems and the difficulties the Soviet troops had to face in carrying out their mission.
In particular, the letter stated that important historic and ethnic factors were overlooked when the decisions on Afghanistan were made in the Soviet Union.
The letter analyzes Soviet interests in Afghanistan and the reasons for the withdrawal of troops.

The Politburo session of January 24, 1989 deals with issues of troops withdrawal and the post-war Soviet role in Afghanistan, as well as possible future development of the situation there.
On April 7, 1988, USSR Defense Minister signed an order on withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
In February 1989, the Defense Ministry prepared a statement of the Soviet Military Command in Afghanistan on the issue of withdrawal of troops, which was delivered to the Head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on February 14, 1989the day when the last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan.
The statement gave an overview of Soviet-Afghan relations before 1979, Soviet interpretation of the reasons for providing internationalist assistance to Afghanistan, and sending troops there after the repeated requests of the Afghan government.
In an important acknowledgement that the Vietnam metaphor was used to analyze Soviet actions in Afghanistan, they military explicitly referred to unfair and absurd comparisons between the American actions in Vietnam and the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
In the history of Afghanistan, the internal conflict between anti-Communist Muslim guerrillas and the Afghan communist government  aided from 1979 to 1989 by Soviet troops .
The roots of the war lay in the overthrow of the centrist Afghanistan government in April 1978 by left-wing military officers, who then handed power over to two Marxist-Leninist political parties, the Khalq  “Masses”  and Parcham  “Flag” , who together had formed the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
The Soviets initially left the suppression of the rebellion to the Afghan army, but the latter was rapidly depleted by mass desertions and remained largely ineffective throughout the war.
The Afghan War quickly settled down into a stalemate, with about 100,000 Soviet troops controlling the cities, large towns, and major garrisons and the mujahideen roaming relatively freely throughout the countryside.
The mujahideen were fragmented politically into a handful of different groups, and their military efforts remained uncoordinated throughout the war.
In 1988 the United States, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union signed an agreement for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the return of Afghanistan to nonaligned status.

There was an initial massive deployment of 100,000 Red Army troops into Afghanistan.
The US saw this as a prime opportunity to weaken the Soviet Union as part of its Cold War strategy , and they began to provide training and arms to the Mujahedeen resistance groups, along with extra support from other countries such as Saudi Arabia  who had their own agenda  and the UK.
Two million people were internally displaced whilst one third of the country’s  pre-war population also fled into neighbouring Pakistan, Iran and further afield.
By 1992, the Communist government had collapsed and the Peshawar Accord declared Afghanistan to be the Islamic State of Afghanistan.
However, many groups refused to acknowledge the new government and the country soon fell into a civil war that lasted throughout the 1990s.
Working government departments, the police, justice systems and education systems did not have time to reform after the Soviet War and much of the country descended into lawlessness.
The group gained increasing recognition, power, and support as it began to take control of much of southern and central Afghanistan.
The Taliban was able to oust the existing weakened government and take over Kabul in September 1996, establishing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
In some areas of Afghanistan, many forms of entertainment, including dance and music, were banned.
Bin Laden had been involved in the Soviet War, providing money to different militia groups to fight the Soviet forces.
He returned to Afghanistan in 1996 after having to flee Sudan and Saudi Arabia, and allegedly used the country as a base to plan and finance attacks internationally.
Western support and financial assistance in the 1990s had dramatically decreased after the end of the Cold War; however, with the increase in the number of attacks on US embassies internationally from Islamist terrorist groups, attention began to increase once again with the US attacking suspected bases belonging to bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1998, along with the UN also ordering increasing sanctions on the Taliban.
Hamid Karzai was installed as President of the interim government in 2001, whilst other coalition forces joined the US and UK to fight against insurgency attacks in Afghanistan; with namely France, Germany and Italy supplying the most troops.
However, since 2006, there has been an increase in the levels of insurgency led by the Taliban who used mainly improvised explosives and suicide bomb attacks; a UN report has suggested that most of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan are the result of Taliban attacks.
The US has given a date of July 2011 for when they want to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, with the aim of shifting control to Afghan security forces by 2014.
Afghanistan is struggling to rebuild itself amidst the ongoing war despite the billions of dollars of aid that have been pumped into the country.
In July 2010,  Wikileaks released a huge cache of 90,000 secret military files related to Afghanistan.
There is no immediate end in sight to the Afghanistan conflict, and its complex issues and lack of stable governance mean that new conflicts will continue to rise.
The stance on development in Afghanistan is shifting slightly, with more awareness being given to locally-led projects as opposed to donor-led projects.
After more than three decades of conflict, the fatigue of war felt by its people is strong, and there is a definite need for a chance of a more tolerable situation in a country where many generations have only known war.

Special Forces Guilty of War Crimes?
Special Forces Guilty of War Crimes?
Special Forces base – was it a war crime or just another episode in a very dirty war?
In the fall of 2012, a team of American Special Forces arrived in Nerkh, a district of Wardak province, Afghanistan, which lies just west of Kabul and straddles a vital highway.
Army Green Berets, trained to wage unconventional warfare, and their arrival was typical of what was happening all over Afghanistan; the big Army units, installed during the surge, were leaving, and in their place came small groups of quiet, bearded Americans, the elite operators who would stay behind to hunt the enemy and stiffen the resolve of government forces long after America’s 13-year war in Afghanistan officially comes to an end.
If true, these accusations would amount to some of the gravest war crimes perpetrated by American forces since 2001.
Officials at the American-led International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, categorically denied these allegations, which came at an extremely delicate moment – as Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the American government were locked in still-unresolved negotiations over the future of American forces in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan warned: “The reported disappearances, arbitrary killings and torture – if proven to have been committed under the auspices of a party to the armed conflict – may amount to war crimes.
Like much of Afghanistan’s rural population, the residents of the district, impoverished tenant farmers, are trapped between the inexorable pressures of the insurgency and the American military.
Wardak is a crucial battleground in the war, a strategic area that both the U.
Nerkh has been a hotbed of guerrilla resistance since the war against the Soviets in the 1980s, when two mujahedeen groups, Harakat-e Islami and Hizb-e Islami, had held sway in the area.
The ALP is a militia program started by the Americans that aims to recruit local armed groups; Turakai had been a Hizb-e Islami commander during the Soviet war, but had thrown in his lot with the Americans once they arrived in the district.
That’s how the war works.
When I show photos of the remains to Stefan Schmitt, director of the International Forensic Program at Physicians for Human Rights, who has extensive experience examining mass graves in Afghanistan, he says that Sayed Mohammad’s corpse, given its relatively intact condition, is consistent with its having been buried at the start of the cold winter season.
He tells me that his father was killed during the Soviet war, and so it had been up to him to provide for his mother and sister.
He says he started as a driver for military intelligence but soon graduated to working as a translator for the Green Beret A-Teams that were part of Task Force 31, nicknamed the “Desert Eagles,” which were hunting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.
He first met the guys of ODA 3124 – the A-Team that came to Nerkh – in Forward Operation Base Cobra in a remote area of southern Afghanistan.
Twelve years of war have taken a toll on U.
But for the most part, he says, Kandahari was popular with the Green Berets because he was tough and fearless in battle, a reliable ally in Afghanistan’s dangerous terrain.
That’s their weapon, saying that these guys committed war crimes.
And the locals get it every time, especially in Afghanistan.
Over a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq has placed an unprecedented strain on U.
The 66,000 members of the Special Operations Command comprise three percent of the military, yet they’ve suffered more than 20 percent of American combat deaths this year in Afghanistan.
And yet when the 2014 deadline for transition arrives and, as Obama put it in his State of the Union Address last February, “our war in Afghanistan will be over,” the quiet professionals of the Special Forces and the CIA will remain behind.
CIA’s attitude toward working with Afghan allies who violate human rights is any indication, the fight in Afghanistan may get even dirtier.
A CIA spokesman says that it “does not take custody of detainees in Afghanistan, nor does it direct Afghan authorities as to where or how to house their prisoners.
NATO mission in Afghanistan stalls over negotiations and reverts to the “zero option” as it did in Iraq, the future of the country may well be one of covert warfare under the auspices of the CIA.
Last month, Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Afghanistan to meet with President Karzai and discuss the issue.
Under the well-established legal principle of command responsibility, military officials who knowingly allow their subordinates to commit war crimes are themselves criminally responsible.
Afghanistan since the early days of the war.
In Afghanistan and Iraq, where defense contractors have generally outnumbered soldiers on the ground, the cast of extras has been especially sprawling and inscrutable—security experts, mercenaries, aid workers, engineers, intelligence types, and consultants of every kind.
In a war zone where so many different agencies, companies, and contractors passed like wary ships in the night, one of the biggest problems was that no one could coordinate knowledge.
Unlike the guys who had come to the war mainly for the hazard pay, Warner seemed genuinely bent on something far grander—redeeming the debacle of Afghanistan through the gospel of open information.
However romantic that gospel sounded, by this point in the war it was clear there was plenty that needed redeeming.
Despite rosy assessments from American politicians and diplomats, Afghanistan was a much less welcoming place in 2011 than it had been on my first visit, five years earlier.
The international forces that had been so successful in ousting the Taliban at the outset of the military campaign had been flummoxed by years of grinding insurgency and the persistence of Afghanistan’s complexities—its rules and rites, traditions and customs.
The war effort, in short, was sophisticated when it came to deploying lethal hardware like drones, but clumsy in just about every other way.
Over tall glasses of water and plates of bananas and shiny red apples, Warner and a young Afghan member of the Synergy Strike Force sat with the men as they explained what more they might need—a schoolhouse with walls, an animal clinic, electricity, bridges, irrigation ditches, a cow so they wouldn’t have to buy milk every day, more security, less war.
Ultimately, what he wanted to do was help the Department of Defense and all its scattered parts—a hulking war apparatus he derisively called “The Machine”—help itself.
Three members of the group were living at the Taj full-time: Jennifer Gold, 26, a National Guard intelligence analyst who had decided to stay in Afghanistan after her deployment ended; Rachel Robb, 27, a human-rights advocate with experience mainly in South America; and her husband, Juan Rodriguez, 28, a photographer from Colombia.
You can’t commute to the war,” she said as we sat in the courtyard, taking a break from her methane generator.
DAVE’S own road to war was strange and circuitous.
By 2006, Wells was trying to figure out how to stimulate more interaction between military and civilian entities in Afghanistan.
This had become a huge problem there, as it had in Iraq—both were war zones where international forces and aid agencies mixed in unprecedentedly complex ways.
So Wells asked Warner to go to Afghanistan and see whether he could come up with some ideas.
On one such evening at the Taj, over drinks with the myriad characters at the bar, Warner learned more about the war than he had at any of the official meetings he’d been to that week.
Morale in the military was dreadful, and the war machine seemed broken.
FOUR MONTHS AFTER I left Afghanistan, I stayed in fairly close touch with Warner and the Synergy Strike Force, keeping tabs on their projects and, in my heart of hearts, rooting for them.
It was not, however, enough to turn the tide in Afghanistan.
We’re definitely going back to Afghanistan.
The Untold Story of America s War in Afghanistan Pt.
Ann Jones is a journalist, photographer  Getty Images , and the author of eight books of nonfiction, including Women Who Kill, Next Time She’ll Be Dead, Kabul in Winter, and War Is Not Over When It’s Over.
She has reported on the impact of war in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, and embedded with American forces in Afghanistan.
She s the author of the new book They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return from America s War--The Untold Story.
What s your response, especially based on the time you spent in Afghanistan?
Nobody can believe that at this point, and certainly nobody believes that about the war in Iraq.
But, you know, the founding fathers, who get so much credit for telling us all sorts of things, told us something about a standing army that we have completely forgotten and that none of these conservatives so eager to go to war remember, and that is they issued very strong warnings against having a standing army, and they predicted precisely what has happened.
And, you know, under the Obama administration, our war effort in Afghanistan was escalated for years.

In a steady stream of audit reports, Sopko s office of Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, has spotlighted seemingly endless waste in the war-torn nation.
In addition to the recent flurry of reports, SIGAR has criticized the spending of $34 million to build Camp Leatherneck in the Washir District of Afghanistan, a 64,000-square-foot facility that was never used and sits empty to this day.
Gardez Hospital, in Afghanistan s southeastern Paktia Province, was found to be delayed for two years due to poor contractor work and overpayment for services never rendered.

A new report has found the war on drugs in Afghanistan remains colossally expensive, largely ineffective and likely to get worse.

Sopko, writes that â€œdespite spending over $7 billion to combat opium poppy cultivation and to develop the Afghan governmentâ€™s counternarcotics capacity, opium poppy cultivation levels in Afghanistan hit an all-time high in 2013,â€� hitting 209,000 hectares, surpassing the prior, 2007 peak of 193,000 hectares.
Sopko adds that the number should continue to rise thanks to deteriorating security in rural Afghanistan and weak eradication efforts.
Though the figures it reports are jarring, the inspector general’sÂ investigation highlights drug policy failures in Afghanistan that have been consistently documented for years.
Indeed, Sopko himself has been raising concerns over the failing drug war in Afghanistan for some time.
In January, he testified before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control and described a series of discouraging conversations with counternarcotics officials from Afghanistan, the U.
In the opinion of almost everyone I spoke with, the situation in Afghanistan is dire with little prospect for improvement in 2014 or beyond,â€� Sopko told the lawmakers.
Afghanistan is still considered the number one producer of opium in the world, responsible for as much as 90 percent of the market, which in turn supports the global heroin trade, even if only a small percentage of heroin from Afghanistan is believed to reach the U.
Sopko reports that the resurgence in Afghan poppy cultivation has been driven by the high price of the crop, cheap and mobile labor, and â€œffordable deep-well technology,” which “has turned 200,000 hectares of desert in southwestern Afghanistan into arable land over the past decade.

The Soviet war in Afghanistan was a war initially fought between the forces of the Afghanistan government and foreign mercenaries.
Without proper equipment and training, the Afghanistan government was unable to resist the foreign mercenaries, eventually seeking the aid of the Soviet Union.
The war began in December 1979, and lasted until February 1989.
The war started when the Soviet Union sent its 40th Army to fight in Afghanistan.
They began to reach Afghanistan from 25 December 1979 .
Then, from 15 May 1988 , the Soviet troops started to leave Afghanistan.
On 15 February 1989 , the Soviet Union announced that all its troops had left Afghanistan.
On 22 December 1979 , Soviet advisors to the Army of Afghanistan took many steps.
The troops wore uniforms similar to the army of Afghanistan.
The Soviets announced freedom of Afghanistan from the rule of President Amin.
Then, the ARCC chose Babrak Karmal as the head of government of Afghanistan.
The government of Afghanistan asked the Soviet Union many times to send troops.
Despite the Soviet Union s treaty with Afghanistan to assist, and fearing a Vietnam-style quagmire, the Soviet Union resisted, instead telling the Afghanistan government to reach a compromise with the foreign mercenaries.
As the situation deteriorated between the Afghanistan government and foreign merecenaries, the Soviet Union initially responded with only intelligence and advisors.
Pakistan thought that the Soviet war in Afghanistan was also a threat to it.
The Soviet war in Afghanistan badly affected the rule of Communist Party.
Many thought that the war was against Islam.
Andrei Sakharov openly said the action of Soviet Army in Afghanistan was wrong.
Over 15,000 Soviet troops got killed in Afghanistan from 1979 until 1989.
In the war, the Soviet Army also lost hundreds of aircraft, and billions worth of other military machines.
Around a million Afghan men, women and children died in the war.
Even after the Soviet Army left Afghanistan, civil war continued in Afghanistan.
Soon, mujaheddin forces won Kabul and started to rule most parts of Afghanistan.
During this war lasting for about ten years, Afghanistan s economy suffered badly.
With the break-up of the Soviet Union in many countries, Afghanistan’s traditional trade also suffered.

US-Pakistan relationship: Soviet Intervention in Afghanistan.

WASHINGTON  AP  — If President Barack Obama were to decide to leave no military advisory force in Afghanistan next year, would Afghan security unravel to the point of enabling a civil war, a Taliban takeover and a return of al-Qaida in such numbers as to pose a 9 11-type threat?
Q: Hasn t Obama said the war will end this year?
A: Yes, but that tells only part of the story of the endgame for America s longest war.
Aside from the fact that for Afghans, the war and its misery almost certainly will not end this year, the remaining issue for Obama is whether to begin a follow-on military advisory mission in January that also would allow U.
Qaida in eastern Afghanistan.
Q: What good would advisers do, if 13 years of combat couldn t win the war?
A war-weary American public appears to have little appetite for even a slimmed-down commitment to remaining involved in the inconclusive war, which began in 2001 and is the longest in American history.
A: He is keeping his options open, but many who have closely followed the war believe Obama will keep pressing the Afghans to approve a U.
Less than a year after he took office, Obama took ownership of the war by ordering an extra 30,000 troops into battle, saying America s security depends on a stable Afghanistan.
Michael O Hanlon of the Brookings Institution think tank said in an email interview Thursday that by choosing the  zero option,  as it has come to be called, Obama would be  perilously close to conceding — or at least risking — defeat  in Afghanistan.
Q: How is it possible that, after 13 years of war, the Afghan forces are not ready to stand on their own?
Martin Dempsey, said after meeting with ground commanders in Afghanistan on Wednesday that he feared a Western departure would embolden the Taliban and even cause some Afghan troops to cooperate with the Taliban to  hedge their bets.
The War in Afghanistan is the first major conflict of the 21st Century.
Though the origins of the war involve the ongoing Afghan Civil War and the Soviet Invasion and Occupation of the 1970s and 1980s, the current war began in October, 2001 in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States.

Qaida retreated toward the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
From 2005 to the present  winter 2007 , the Taliban has increased its attacks and is using suicide bombers and other tactics from the Iraq War.
On February 27, 2007, while on a diplomatic trip to Afghanistan, an apparent assassination attempt was made by Taliban insurgents, who claimed that Cheney was a target in the attack.
In the spring and summer of 2008, the violence in Afghanistan claimed more coalition  foreign  troops than died in the concurrent Iraq War.
The new Obama Administration called for significantly increasing the size of the American military presence in Afghanistan, and allies in Europe are expecting President Obama to pressure them to provide more troops as well.
Place: Central Afghanistan.
In the first half of the century France as the British bogeyman gave way to Russia, leading finally to the Crimean War in 1854.
In 1839 the obsession in British India was that the Russians, extending the Tsar’s empire east into Asia, would invade India through Afghanistan.
This widely held obsession led Lord Auckland, the British governor general in India, to enter into the First Afghan War, one of Britain’s most ill-advised and disastrous wars.
Until the First Afghan War the Sirkar  the Indian colloquial name for the East India Company  had an overwhelming reputation for efficiency and good luck.
The Afghan War severely undermined this view.
The causes of the disaster are easily stated: the difficulties of campaigning in Afghanistan’s inhospitable mountainous terrain with its extremes of weather, the turbulent politics of the country and its armed and refractory population and finally the failure of the British authorities to appoint senior officers capable of conducting the campaign competently and decisively.
The disaster of the First Afghan War was a substantial contributing factor to the outbreak of the Great Mutiny in the Bengal Army in 1857.
Following the British capture of Kandahar and Ghuznee Dost Mohammed, whose replacement on the throne in Kabul by Shah Shujah was the purpose of the British expedition into Afghanistan, despairing of the support of his army fled to the hills.
Soon afterwards, despairing of his life in the mountains, Dost Mohammed surrendered to Macnaghten and went into exile in India, escorted by a division of British and Indian troops no longer required in Afghanistan and accompanied by the commander in chief Sir Willoughby Cotton.
The fate of the British and Indian forces in Afghanistan in the winter of 1840 to 1841 provides a striking illustration of the collapse of morale and military efficiency where the officers in command are indecisive and wholly lacking in initiative and self-confidence.
The only senior officer left in Afghanistan with any ability was Brigadier Nott, the garrison commander at Kandahar.
Brigadier Sale and his troops in Jellalabad for a time contemplated retreating to India, but more resolute councils prevailed, particularly from Captains Broadfoot and Havelock, and the garrison hung on to act as the springboard for the entry of the “Army of Retribution” into Afghanistan the next year.
The First Afghan War provided the clear lesson to the British authorities that while it may be relatively straightforward to invade Afghanistan it is wholly impracticable to occupy the country or attempt to impose a government not welcomed by the inhabitants.
The War provides a fascinating illustration of how the character and determination of its leaders can be decisive in determining the morale and success of a military expedition.
It is an article looking at CIA involvement in the Afghan war, and is provided here as some additional background to Afghanistan.
A specially equipped C-141 Starlifter transport carrying William Casey touched down at a military air base south of Islamabad in October 1984 for a secret visit by the CIA director to plan strategy for the war against Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
During the visit, Casey startled his Pakistani hosts by proposing that they take the Afghan war into enemy territory -- into the Soviet Union itself.
Casey wanted to ship subversive propaganda through Afghanistan to the Soviet Union s predominantly Muslim southern republics.
The Afghans themselves did the fighting and dying -- and ultimately won their war against the Soviets -- and not all of them laud the CIA s role in their victory.
But even some sharp critics of the CIA agree that in military terms, its secret 1985 escalation of covert support to the mujaheddin made a major difference in Afghanistan, the last battlefield of the long Cold War.
How the Reagan administration decided to go for victory in the Afghan war between 1984 and 1988 has been shrouded in secrecy and clouded by the sharply divergent political agendas of those involved.
But with the triumph of the mujaheddin rebels over Afghanistan s leftist government in April and the demise of the Soviet Union, some intelligence officials involved have decided to reveal how the covert escalation was carried out.
The most prominent of these former intelligence officers is Yousaf, the Pakistani general who supervised the covert war between 1983 and 1987 and who last month published in Europe and Pakistan a detailed account of his role and that of the CIA, titled  The Bear Trap.
To Yousaf, who managed the Koran-smuggling program and the guerrilla raids inside Soviet territory, the United States ultimately  chickened out  on the question of taking the secret Afghan war onto Soviet soil.
An intelligence coup in 1984 and 1985 triggered the Reagan administration s decision to escalate the covert progam in Afghanistan, according to Western officials.
The United States received highly specific, sensitive information about Kremlin politics and new Soviet war plans in Afghanistan.
Before the missiles arrived, however, those involved in the covert war wrestled with a wide-ranging and at times divisive debate over how far they should go in challenging the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
In 1980, not long after Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan to prop up a sympathetic leftist government, President Jimmy Carter signed the first -- and for many years the only -- presidential  finding  on Afghanistan, the classified directive required by U.
The Carter finding sought to aid Afghan rebels in  harassment  of Soviet occupying forces in Afghanistan through secret supplies of light weapons and other assistance.
The finding did not talk of driving Soviet forces out of Afghanistan or defeating them militarily, goals few considered possible at the time, these sources said.
China sold weapons to the CIA and donated a smaller number directly to Pakistan, but the extent of China s role has been one of the secret war s most closely guarded secrets.
It was the largest covert action program since World War II.
In the first years after the Reagan administration inherited the Carter program, the covert Afghan war  tended to be handled out of Casey s back pocket,  recalled Ronald Spiers, a former U.
Most of the weapons dated to the Korean War or earlier.
Beginning in 1984, Soviet forces in Afghanistan began to experiment with new and more aggressive tactics against the mujaheddin, based on the use of Soviet special forces, called the Spetsnaz, in helicopter-borne assaults on Afghan rebel supply lines.
The new Soviet tactics reflected a perception in the Kremlin that the Red Army was in danger of becoming bogged down in Afghanistan and needed to take decisive steps to win the war, according to sensitive intelligence that reached the Reagan administration in 1984 and 1985, Western officials said.
The intelligence came from the upper reaches of the Soviet Defense Ministry and indicated that Soviet hard-liners were pushing a plan to attempt to win the Afghan war within two years, sources said.
The new war plan was to be implemented by Gen.
Mikhail Zaitsev, who was transferred from the prestigious command of Soviet forces in Germany to run the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the spring of 1985, just as Mikhail Gorbachev was battling hard-line rivals to take power in a Kremlin succession struggle.
The intelligence about Soviet war plans in Afghanistan was highly specific, according to Western sources.
The Soviets intended to deploy one-third of their total Spetsnaz forces in Afghanistan -- nearly 2,000  highly trained and motivated  paratroops, according to Yousaf.
The answers they came up with, said a Western official, were to provide  secure communications , kill the gunships and the fighter cover, better routes for  infiltration, and get to work on  targets  in Afghanistan, including the Omsk vans, through the use of satellite reconnaissance and increased, specialized guerrilla training.
For their part, CIA officers felt the war was not going as badly as some skeptics thought, and they worried that it might not be possible to preserve secrecy in the midst of a major escalation.
Although it covered diplomatic and humanitarian objectives as well, the new, detailed Reagan directive used bold language to authorize stepped-up covert military aid to the mujaheddin, and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal: to defeat Soviet troops in Afghanistan through covert action and encourage a Soviet withdrawal.
CIA and Pentagon specialists offered detailed satellite photographs and ink maps of Soviet targets around Afghanistan.
The new efforts focused on strategic targets such as the Termez Bridge between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.
Soon the wall of Yousaf s office was covered with detailed maps of Soviet targets in Afghanistan such as airfields, armories and military buildings.
Reagan s 1985 National Security Directive helped to change the character of the Afghan war, intensifying the struggle and raising the stakes for both sides.
Kabul, Afghanistan — It has become the longest war in US history – nearly 11 years.
What, in the end, has the United States achieved after all this time and treasury spent in Afghanistan ?
Americans have become increasingly weary of the war.
A Monitor TIPP poll conducted in May found that 63 percent of Americans oppose a newly signed security pact that would keep many US soldiers in Afghanistan after the majority of combat troops are withdrawn in 2014.
Many Afghans, including insurgents interviewed for this story, say that a swift pullout will lead to the collapse of the Afghan government, the breakup of the national army, and the spark of a new civil war.
As a young university student, studying business at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul , she doesn t need to wear a head-to-toe burqa when she goes out on the streets of the capital city, as she did as a young girl growing up in Kandahar .
Social custom once made it difficult for male doctors to treat female patients – to even be in the same room with a woman who wasn t a personal relation – which helped give Afghanistan one of the highest mortality rates for mothers in childbirth in the world: 1,600 deaths for every 100,000 births.
We want to do something for Afghanistan.
Zahra Khawari, a senior in English literature at Kabul University and simultaneously a freshman in business at the American University of Afghanistan, is an Afghan national who grew up as a refugee in Iran and didn t arrive here until 2005.
It is] very tired of war.
White sport utility vehicles dominated the roads, driven by foreign aid workers, although Taliban pickup trucks also spirited through town full of bearded soldiers heading off to war in the north.
Corruption may be the most talked-about subject in Afghanistan, and one that many see as the largest impediment to creating a country that can stand on its own.
While corruption has existed in Afghanistan for centuries, it has become a full-scale industry since the arrival of American troops and Western aid dollars.
The problem, says Yama Torabi, head of Integrity Afghanistan, an anticorruption watchdog group, is that Afghanistan s Western donors have a political incentive to support the Afghan government and show results for the billions of dollars that they spend.
Last year, when the USAID  budget for Afghanistan was cut by 40 percent, that was good news for us,  says Mr.
No one knows how much of the $517 billion the US has cumulatively spent in Afghanistan has been misused.
But if you add up the anecdotes of schools or clinics built with shoddy materials; of politicians who have used their positions to steal public land, siphon off money for personal use, or to protect criminal enterprises; and of civil servants who have taken bribes; you get a troubling view of Afghanistan s political culture.
Bashir s brother, who lives in the US, has tried to persuade him to leave Afghanistan, but Bashir says he will stay and serve his people.
Sometimes that work has been as a shopkeeper, sometimes as a farmer; and during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1991, Mr.
Mahmud – not his real name – says he stopped fighting when the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996, and he didn t rejoin the war as many of his younger neighbors did when the Americans helped to push the Taliban out in January 2002.
I see war from morning to night,  he says, smiling grimly.
If the goal of sending troops to Afghanistan was to uproot Al Qaeda and to stop its use of Afghanistan as a haven, then Operation Enduring Freedom has been a remarkable success.
Al Qaeda may have had just a few hundred members in 2001, when the war began.
As for the Taliban, who once controlled 90 percent of Afghanistan and numbered in the tens of thousands, they now have the ability to hold territory in places like Helmand in the south and Nooristan in the east, and to create a sense of insecurity in many rural areas that effectively weakens trust in the Afghan government.
I don t think that the Taliban will effectively take over after the withdrawal of American troops in 2014 because they are now more fragmented, basically village militias,  says Fabrizio Faschini, a security expert at the Afghanistan Analysts Network in Kabul.
Everyone knows American power is fake, and they cannot win this war because they are fighting for no reason, no goals,  says a Taliban supporter in Peshawar who refuses to give his real name.
It was true for the Anglo-Saxons, Italians, Boston Irish, Poles, Jews, Latinos, native Americans, and African-Americans who fought under the US flag during World War II.
Ahmedullah, an Afghan Army major and an ethnic Pashtun, feels confident that the men under his command are getting better training and feel more of a sense of national purpose than any other Afghan soldiers have since King Ahmad Shah Durrani united Afghanistan in 1747.
But if international donor support is withdrawn from Afghanistan when foreign troops leave in 2014, he says, his battalion will probably disintegrate without the discipline and cultural unity the Westerners help enforce.
If foreign support is taken away after 2014, then things will go back to the days of civil war,  says Ahmedullah, who agreed to talk on the condition that his name be changed.
Of all Afghanistan s challenges – from security, to corruption, to social liberation – probably the most difficult is the task of creating a single Afghan identity.
Part of the problem, says Hussein Yasa, a newspaper publisher in Kabul, is that Afghanistan has few institutions that can unify Afghans.
Koofi says she doesn t believe Afghans will allow themselves to be manipulated by ethnic divisions the way they were during the civil war of the 1990s.
You can t impose a government on the people when the people are educated, and when they remember the days of war,  she says.
Long War?
Rethinking Afghanistan?
Go to War?
The International Business Times reported Friday that the Department of Veterans Affairs had stopped releasing the number of non-fatal casualties of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, thus concealing what the paper called a “grim milestone” of 1 million injuries.
All that can be said with any certainty is that as of last December more than 900,000 service men and women had been treated at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics since returning from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the monthly rate of new patients to these facilities as of the end of 2012 was around 10,000.
In March, VA abruptly stopped releasing statistics on non-fatal war casualties to the public.
Iraq and Afghanistan without warning, claiming unspecified “security” reasons.
Nearly 270,000 brain injuries have been diagnosed by the Defense Department since 2001, most of them were likely sustained in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Earlier this year, I reported that of the more than 50,000 service members wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan who are considered polytrauma patients, 1,600 have moderate to severe brain injuries, 1,400 are amputees, and 900 were severely burned.
Two-thirds of Americans say the war in Afghanistan hasn’t been worth fighting, but 55 percent nonetheless favor keeping some U.
United States and Afghanistan, whose president, Hamid Karzai, has balked at signing a negotiated accord.
Americans say the war has not been worth fighting, just one point from its high in July and matching peak criticism of the war in Iraq.
Moreover, a new high of 50 percent feel “strongly” that the war in Afghanistan has not been worth it, outnumbering their opposites by 34 percentage points.
This poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates , finds that attitudes on the war overall influence views on withdrawal.
Among Americans who think the war’s been worth fighting, 76 percent support keeping some U.
Criticism of the war is substantial across demographic groups.
Afghanistan more than three times the duration of its 1,346-day  3 years, 8 months, 7 days  participation in World War II.
But Iraq, increasingly slipping toward civil war, should offer Americans a cautionary tale about U.
It’s tough for a war-weary American public to concede, but the costs paid in American blood  2,193 killed  and treasure  $700 billion  could well be spilled in vain if there isn’t some continuing U.
Part of its mission will be ensuring that the $4 billion NATO nations are slated to invest in Afghanistan annually is properly spent.
The sticking point in both Afghanistan and Iraq was protecting U.
Unfortunately, Afghanistan has witnessed a poor track record of the US forces during the past 10 years of their military operations,” Ajmal Shams, president of the Afghan Social Democratic Party, wrote in a column in the United Arab Emirates’ Gulf News newspaper Sunday.
Bombings killed one coalition soldier in southern Afghanistan and a civilian in northern Afghanistan.
The apparent civil war in Iraq is all the more reason to pullout of Afghanistan, as scheduled in 2014.
Saddam fought a war with Iran for years using poison gas.
Now Obama is attempting to do it again in Afghanistan and it appears that the corrupt, two faced Dictator President Karzai will adopt it.
Ah, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Making the Korean War look like a good war with every passing year.
Our longest war  and more relevant in comparison  were the Indian Wars which took up most of the 19th Century but usually refers to the period from1865 to 1890.
We re also still involved in ROK even though the war there isn t over  1950-present .
If Americans stop enlisting, the war in Afghanistan will end.
This war by NATO and the rest of the world is  also against the Drug Lords who control a  vast empire from Colombia to Cambodia!
The US o f A is being inundated  with drugs by cartels that grow most of the opium in Afghanistan.
NATO and the US just cannot abandon Afghanistan to   DRUG anarchy.
But in this war,  very few non-Aghanis have really understood the  religious feelings,culture and  tribal traditions in Afghanistan.
The US of A  and NATO interfered in Iraq and  Afghanistan and  have left both   in ruins.
The longest War , the KOREAN War and it s aftermath remains a festering wound.
The  Cuban conflict and Vietnam War, the killing fields of Cambodia  have left behind many bitter memories.
The Iranian revolution, the US Embassy HOSTAGE crisis,  Iraq-Iran war, invasion of Kuwait,  the removal of Saddam Hussein, Qaddafi, Mubarak , the festering ISRAEL-Palestine conflict and now the Syrian civil war.
But please stop shooting people using drones if you want democracy in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
This is NOT the longest war America has been in folks.
There is a war.
Korean War!
This war has not ended for NO peace treaty has been signed.
So the longest War technically speaking is NOT Afghanistan .
Korean War.
In Afghanistan, there are at least 2 major languages  DARI, Poshtu  and maybe 17 total  Dari, Poshtu, Pashai, Nuristani, Baluchi,- just off the top of my head .
Get the CIA out of Afghanistan and the war will go away.
But Iraq, increasingly slipping toward civil war, should offer Americans a cautionary tale about U.
Delaying the departure of all US troops from Afghanistan will guarantee a continuation of the war, of our troops getting killed and millions more down the drain.
And the continued use of   al Qaeda and the Taliban  to define the insurgents will get some continued support from the US public of the war but as we must all understand by now, most of the  insurgents  are of the people who want to see an end of our occupation of their country.
Comparing Iraqi lessons to Afghanistan and vice versa is plain skewed, arrogant American thinking.
What amazes me is how important a largely worthless place like Afghanistan has become.
Hurmph, if we had forced Obamacare on Afghanistan, the crazy Jihadist would have all died of medical care by now.
Actually the US nd Afghanistan have not agreed on a pact.
Obama and Karzai agreed, but unlike in the US, in Afghanistan there is a modicum of democracy.
Lobbying at it s best is what s keeping this war ongoing.
Let s get the heck outa  there and next war they come up with has to have Congress and their families fight it.
It only goes on as a war of choice.
But the promise was we d be out of Afghanistan by 2014.
If anything is the definition of a  good war , that was it.
B_INF_Retired  But Retired, we re not actively in a war zone, as we are in the middle east.
Now it s a war, now it isn t, just spend, spend spend.
The war in Iraq ended for us and that is what matters for me and my family and the US.
If anyone from the US wants to be a war monger no one is stopping them from going to Iraq on their own but for the US it is all done.
But I have worked in Afghanistan off and on since 1971.
Will the war end when and if we leave Afghanistan?
Or using Sons of Iraq in Afghanistan.
The Soviet Afghanistan War was fought between Afghanistan rebels called the Mujahideen and the Soviet supported Afghanistan government.
The United States supported the Afghanistan rebels in order to try and overthrow the communist government and to prevent the spread of communism.
The leaders of Afghanistan during the war included General Secretary Babrak Karmal and President Mohammad Najibullah.
As one of its bordering neighbors, the Soviet Union had a long history of supporting and providing aid to Afghanistan.
The new government was called the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  DRA .
Many of the Afghanistan people did not like the new communist government, primarily because many of the laws went against their Muslim religion.
In September of 1979, events in Afghanistan became more unstable when Afghan leader Hafizullah Amin had the current president killed and took control of the communist government.
On December 24, 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
Many of the Soviet soldiers were untested in battle and their gear was not designed for the harsh environment of Afghanistan.
As the war continued with little success, it became a source of embarrassment for the Soviet Union.
The war was condemned by the United Nations, the US pulled out of the SALT treaty talks, and the US boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.
When Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union he wanted the war to end.
He first tried to increase Soviet troops to end the war quickly.
By 1988 Gorbachev realized the war was costing Soviet troops and hurting their economy.
He signed a peace treaty to end the war.
The last Soviet troops departed Afghanistan on February 15, 1989.
Because the Soviet Union failed in securing Afghanistan from the rebels for such a long period of time, the war is sometimes referred to as the Soviet Union s Vietnam War.
These enabled them to shoot down Soviet helicopters and were a major turning point in the war.
Around 13,000 Soviet troops were killed in the war.
It s estimated that over 1 million Afghanis died from the war.
Around 5 million people fled the country of Afghanistan during the war.
The war destroyed much of the country s infrastructure.
It became one of the poorest nations in the world after the war was over.

WASHINGTON — As the United States and its allies began launching airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in August, another — less public — air war was also heating up: in Afghanistan.
Officials said they were still compiling the bombing statistics for September but the recent uptick in air attacks in Afghanistan comes as the United States is preparing to pull out about half of its 24,000 troops by the end of the year and curtail most combat operations.
The drawdown of coalition forces in Afghanistan, combined with the increasing combat capability of Afghan security forces, obviously will reduce the level of coalition air activity there in the coming months,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Edward Sholtis, a spokesman for US Air Forces Central Command in Qatar, said via e-mail.
But for now there’s no significant, sustained dip in the level of air operations in Afghanistan.
Partly as a result, Campbell said, the number of US aircraft inside Afghanistan available to conduct strikes, gather intelligence, and provide logistical support to the Afghans “will be greatly diminished from what we have today” by the end of the year.
Indeed, some specialists said the recent reliance on more airstrikes foreshadows the next phase of the war in Afghanistan.
I believe that we are going to have ‘1-800-air power’ for the conceivable future in Afghanistan.
Unlike in Iraq and Syria, however, the US Central Command said it does not plan to release daily statistics on air attacks in Afghanistan.
A Central Command spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Belcher, said that in Afghanistan the air operations are responding to the constantly changing needs of US and coalition ground troops who are confronting insurgents.
The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and the U.
At the end of December 1979, the Soviet Union sent thousands of troops into                         Afghanistan and immediately assumed complete military                     and political control of Kabul and large portions of the                     country.
This event began a brutal, decade-long attempt by Moscow to subdue the                     Afghan civil war and maintain a friendly and socialist government on its border.
It was a watershed event of the Cold War, marking the only time the Soviet Union                     invaded a country outside the Eastern Bloc—a strategic decision met by nearly                     worldwide condemnation.
While the massive, lightning-fast military maneuvers and                     brazenness of Soviet political objectives constituted an “invasion” of                     Afghanistan, the word “intervention” more accurately describes these events as                     the culmination of growing Soviet domination going back to 1973.
Undoubtedly,                     leaders in the Kremlin had hoped that a rapid and complete military takeover                     would secure Afghanistan’s place as an exemplar of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which                     held that once a country became socialist Moscow would never permit it to return                     to the capitalist camp.
The United States and its European allies, guided by                     their own doctrine of containment, sharply criticized the Soviet move into                     Afghanistan and devised numerous measures to compel Moscow to withdraw.
Soviet combat vehicles move through Afghanistan.
Since 1955 Moscow had provided                     military training and materiel to Afghanistan; by 1973, a third of active troops                     had trained on Soviet soil.
Additionally, Daoud enjoyed the support of the                     People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan  PDPA , founded in 1965 upon Marxist                     ideology and allegiance to Moscow.
In response, Daoud hoped to mitigate both of                     these threats by steering Afghanistan away from Soviet influence and improving                     U.
The                     Carter administration recognized that Taraki would undo Daoud’s attempt to steer                     Afghanistan away from Moscow, and it debated whether to cut ties with                     Afghanistan or recognize Taraki in the hopes that Soviet influence could be                     contained.
Shortly after the revolution, Washington                     recognized the new government and soon named Adolph Dubs its Ambassador to                     Afghanistan.
This insurrection intensified over the next year and it                     became increasingly obvious to the Soviets that Taraki could not prevent all-out                     civil war and the prospect of a hostile Islamic government taking control.
In sum, these actions were                     Washington’s collective attempt to make the Soviets’ “adventure” in Afghanistan                     as painful and brief as possible.
Editor s note: We re monitoring reports of an explosion in Kabul, Afghanistan.
The War in Afghanistan  2001–present  refers to the intervention by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  NATO  and allied forces in the ongoing Afghan civil war.
The war followed the September 11 attacks, and its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and denying it a safe basis of operation in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power.
In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
The Taliban exploited weaknesses in the Afghan government, among the most corrupt in the world, to reassert influence across rural areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan.
As of 2013, tens of thousands of people had been killed in the war.
In wars, and especially in counterinsurgency wars such as the American war in Afghanistan, it’s often said that killing civilians creates insurgents.
Stanley McChrystal, who commanded US forces in the Afghan War, often referred to this as “insurgent math.
Because of CivCas , I think we have just about eroded our credibility here in Afghanistan,” said McChrystal in 2010, according to the Marine Corps Times.
Called “The Effect of Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq,” it was assembled by researchers from Princeton, Stanford and the London School of Economics, and it was facilitated by Col.
While serving in Afghanistan, Felter worked closely with McChrystal and his successor, Gen.
Perhaps the clearest and most succinct explanation of why the war in Afghanistan was failing came inadvertently from General McChrystal himself, in an October 1, 2009, address to the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
The White House National Security Council announced late Thursday that it was transferring a terrorism detainee from Afghanistan into U.
It was an understated coda to America’s secret war in Afghanistan—the final and decisive battle of the Cold War, a brilliantly successful covert operation that would also prove to be the start of the global jihad.
In his new book, What We Won: America’s Secret War in Afghanistan, 1979-1989  Brookings Institution Press, 2014 , CIA veteran and Director of the Brookings Intelligence Project Bruce Riedel seeks to answer how and why this intelligence operation succeeded so brilliantly.
Riedel explores the complex personalities in the war—the Afghan communists, the Russians, the Afghan mujahedin, the Saudis, the Pakistanis, and the Americans—and what we can learn from a war in which no Americans fought on the battlefield.
In surveying the decade-long intelligence enterprise, Riedel highlights the complexities of a war influenced both by the weaknesses and mistakes of America’s enemies, as well as the good judgment and strengths of the United States.

The trickiest problem in evaluating a limited war is not  in making clear what limits were observed, or even in trying to  estimate the results of those limits, but in trying to  decide by what standard to judge the limits.
People who ask why  the United States waged a limited war in Vietnam implicitly  assume, for the most part, that this should be considered an odd  anomaly, that total war is the normal form of warfare.
The issues involved can be considerably illuminated by  comparison with a very similar war: that fought by the Soviet  Union in Afghanistan.
The problem began in April 1978, when the People s Democratic  Party of Afghanistan carried out a coup and Noor Taraki became the  leader of the new government.
Soviet troops went into Afghanistan with the assumption that by  siezing the capital they were siezing the country.
During the first phase of the ensuing war, the Soviets conducted  large-scale, conventional attacks, motorized and with heavy weapons  and air power, into rebel strongholds.
This war began toward the end of Jimmy Carter s term as President  of the United States.
Carter provided some US military aid to the  guerrillas fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan while he was president.
Figures from Cordesman & Wagner, The Lessons of  Modern War, vol.
In 1988, the Soviets decided to quit, and signed an agreement  under which all their forces were to be out of Afghanistan by  February 15, 1989.
The fundamental pattern of the wars in Afghanistan and and Vietnam  was strikingly similar.
In each case, the government of a Third World country was challenged  by a guerrilla war.
Those tempted to treat this as a simple question should be  reminded that in the early years of the war, most of the northerners  fighting in South Vietnam were in the ARVN, rather than in the  Communist forces.
The Soviet  Union directly overthrew and killed Hafizullah Amin, at that time the  Communist ruler of Afghanistan, in 1979.
After the coups of 1963 in Vietnam  and 1979 in Afghanistan, the status of the government as a puppet   regime created by foreigners was at least as clear in Afghanistan  as in South Vietnam.
It claimed to be eager to negotiate a  reasonable compromise settlement of the war, and denounced the  intransigence of the other side as the main obstacle to such a  settlement.
A sample of such propaganda lines on the Soviet side,  remarkably similar to US propaganda during the Vietnam War, was  conveniently gathered together in Pravda International,  vol.
It is, of course, so far from reality that it  would be comic, if not for one sobering thought: many of the  Soviet troops fighting in Afghanistan probably believed that  these fairy tales represented an accurate picture of the cause  for which they were fighting.
To better understand how Afghans have experienced and understand the devastating conflict of the last thirty years, eight nongovernmental organizations operating in Afghanistan conducted research in 14 provinces across the country.
The individuals consulted overwhelmingly expressed a desire for peace, which they saw as not just an end to the physical violence of war but included respect for basic human rights, the alleviation of poverty, an effective and accountable government and access to basic services such as healthcare and education.

The Financial Legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan: How Wartime Spending Decisions Will Constrain Future National Security Budgets.
The Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, taken together, will be the most expensive wars in US history – totaling somewhere between $4 to $6 trillion.
Additional funds are committed to replacing large quantities of basic equipment used in the wars and to support ongoing diplomatic presence and military assistance in the Iraq and Afghanistan region.
The large sums borrowed to finance operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will also impose substantial long-term debt servicing costs.
The legacy of decisions taken during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars will dominate future federal budgets for decades to come.

Special Ops raids and reliance on brutal militias will wreak havoc in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future.
Last week, President Obama tried his best to spin the facts to announce that the war in Afghanistan was ending.
While many American troops will come home in December, 800 will be left to continue to occupy and wage war in Afghanistan at a cost of at least $20 billion.
Even if the presence of foreigners is vastly reduced, the people of Afghanistan will remain caught in an endless conflict between the Taliban and Afghan security forces.
So the war will grind on.
In 2009, President Obama announced a “surge” for the Afghanistan war that would send 33,000 more troops to the country.
The list kept on expanding, and under General Stanley McCrystal, who took over the military’s war effort in 2009, the pace of night raids increased to at least 90 a month.

Obama was accompanied by a few advisers, including senior counselor John Podesta, whose son is serving in Afghanistan.
As is typical of recent presidential trips to war zones, the White House did not announce Obama s visit in advance.
The president s visit took place against the backdrop of growing outrage in the United States over the treatment of America s war veterans.
The agency already was struggling to keep up with the influx of forces returning home from Afghanistan and Iraq.
While combat forces are due to depart at the end of this year, Obama administration officials have pressed to keep some troops in Afghanistan after 2014 to continue training the Afghan security forces and undertake counterterrorism missions.
Obama has insisted he will not keep any Americans in Afghanistan without a signed security agreement that would grant those forces immunity from Afghan law.

An analysis of news reports about the war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2010 shows that reporters at three major US news outlets wrote increasingly negative stories.
When the war in Afghanistan started, the tone of the stories that reporters filed was generally neutral,” says Michel Haigh, associate professor of communications at Penn State.
In 2003, as the media began to focus more on the conflict in Iraq, reporters for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times wrote less than 20 stories about Afghanistan.
Haigh and colleagues examined articles about the war from these three major newspapers during the 10-year period from 2001 to 2010.
Between 2009 and 2010, when casualties reached their highest levels, there were more than 450 articles written about the war in Afghanistan.
The negativity toward the war effort was reflected in stories written by reporters in the field, as well as articles written by journalists in the US and in other countries, says Haigh.
While reporters who were embedded in military units in previous conflicts tended to be more positive about the military, embedded reporters in Afghanistan were typically negative.
In fact, reporters in Afghanistan wrote stories with tones that were slightly less positive about the military than reporters who wrote their articles outside the country.
Typically, the use of embeds in a military unit leads to more positive reporting, however, coverage in Afghanistan was negative, regardless of whether the journalists reported from in Afghanistan or outside the country.
For example, a journalist may decide to focus the story on the war on terrorism or on casualties.
In this case, reporters both inside and outside of Afghanistan reported on the increasing casualties.
Reporters who were not in Afghanistan also wrote stories on the economic and political impact of the conflict.
There were fewer embedded reporters in Afghanistan than in previous conflicts.
Because newspapers pay to have embedded reporters travel with the troops, the cost of sending reporters to file stories in Afghanistan was too expensive for most news outlets that were struggling during the economic downturn.

When the world hears American leader after leader make claims of victory and success year after year – yet sees with their eyes that in fact the war has been an unmitigated failure – they can t help but lose faith in the word of our country.

To be truthful about it, there was no way we could have got the  public consent to have suddenly launched a campaign on Afghanistan but for what happened on September 11.
Last week, when President Obama made his trip to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, he claimed that “America’s war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end.
With his assertion, Obama, in effect, declared himself the hero of the Afghan war – the one who put an end to that nightmare.
But what Obama failed to mention was that it was his war, and that nothing but unattractive scenarios lie ahead for that war-torn state.
Indeed, Afghanistan might just continue to hold down its ranking as the most violent country in the Global Peace Index .
Graciana del Castillo, one of the world’s leading experts on failed states, has just written a most edifying book on the Afghan war   Guilty Party: The International Community in Afghanistan.
Del Castillo’s book allows us to finally understand just what a fiasco the Afghan war has been.
Why is Afghanistan, as Bob Woodward correctly termed it , Obama’s war?
Del Castillo’s sharp pencil work shows that during the period 2002-2013, $650 billion have been appropriated for the Afghan war effort, and a whopping $487.
To put these outsized numbers into perspective, just consider that the total cost of the Afghan war from 2002-2013 amounts to $7089 per American taxpayer  based on the number of income tax returns  .
To put Afghanistan’s financing gap into perspective, the Afghan government estimates the total fiscal deficiency that they will face over the next decade would amount to a whopping $120 billion.
Considering that a July 2013 Washington Post ABC poll showed that only 28% of Americans say the war in Afghanistan has been worth the cost, it is unlikely that the U.
And if this isn’t bad enough, consider that the countryside has been forgotten and neglected during the war years.
And, the most attractive cash crop in Afghanistan is poppies.
Not surprisingly, the poppy plantations have greatly expanded, from 75 thousand hectares in 2002  near the start of the war , to over 210 thousand in 2013, surpassing the previous peak of 190 thousand hectares in 2007.

During Afghanistan’s civil war, in the nineteen-nineties, western Kabul’s Karta Seh neighborhood was a no man’s land, fought over by three militias.
In the eleven years since the American invasion of Afghanistan, Abdul Nasir has become a modern and prosperous professional.
Nasir recalled that when Afghanistan’s civil war broke out, in April, 1992, he was an agricultural student at Kabul University.
Over the next three years, tens of thousands of Afghans died in the civil war.
The ethnic battle lines in Afghanistan have not changed.
In April, I drove to Khanabad, a rural district near the city of Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan.
Omar’s brother Habibullah had been a lieutenant for Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, one of the leading commanders in the war against the Soviets, and a warlord who helped destroy Kabul during the civil war.
American Special Forces have set up armed neighborhood groups like Omar’s across Afghanistan.
Some groups, like the Afghanistan Local Police, have official supervision, but others, like Omar’s, are on their own.
His stack of business cards includes that of Brigadier General Edward Reeder, an American in charge of Special Forces in Afghanistan in 2009, when the Americans began counterattacking in Kunduz.
The militias established or tolerated by the Afghan and American governments constitute a reversal of the efforts made in the early years of the war to disarm such groups, which were blamed for destroying the country during the civil war.
Like Omar, Alam was a commander during the civil war.
Much of the violence and disorder in Kunduz, as elsewhere in Afghanistan, takes place beyond the vision of American soldiers and diplomats.
In the early years of the war, diplomats were encouraged to leave their compounds and meet ordinary Afghans.
Mark my words, the moment the Americans leave, the civil war will begin,” he said.
Jamiat is composed mostly of ethnic Tajiks, a minority in Afghanistan, and the group that held out longest against the Taliban, until the American invasion.
From the beginning, the dominance of the Army by ethnic Tajiks, and, in particular, by members of Jamiat-e-Islami, has been a source of tension with the Pashtuns, Afghanistan’s largest and historically most powerful ethnic group.
Antonio Giustozzi, an Italian researcher who has written extensively on Afghanistan, said.
Afghan and American officials believe that some precipitating event could prompt the country’s ethnic minorities to fall back into their enclaves in northern Afghanistan, taking large chunks of the Army and police forces with them.
A coup is one of the big possibilities—a coup or civil war,” a former American official who was based in Kabul and has since left the country told me.
It’s clear that the main factions assume that civil war is a possibility and they are hedging their bets.
And, of course, once people assume that civil war is going to happen then that can sometimes be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Bolger conceded the lack of Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan, the epicenter of the Taliban insurgency, adding, “We are trying to get those numbers up.
The only thing stopping the civil war is the presence of the Americans.
They moved Daud to the north to get ready for the civil war,” the defense official said.
One senior American officer who works outside northern Afghanistan told me in May, “When I have tried to get resources for my area, I haven’t been able to, because those resources are going somewhere else.
It’s unclear how the police and the militia commanders installed across northern Afghanistan would react if they felt that the government in Kabul was moving against them.
When I asked Ali who his boss was, he replied that it was not Karzai but Mohammad Fahim, the Jamiat commander, who is one of the Vice-Presidents of Afghanistan.
If the soldiers see a civil war coming, or big Taliban gains on the battlefield, then I think the Army will lose most of the Pashtun troops.
He added, “The only thing that could really stop a civil war is a strong Afghan Army.
After eleven years, nearly two thousand Americans killed, sixteen thousand Americans wounded, nearly four hundred billion dollars spent, and more than twelve thousand Afghan civilians dead since 2007, the war in Afghanistan has come to this: the United States is leaving, mission not accomplished.
And it’s a good bet that, in some remote mountain valley, even Al Qaeda, which brought the United States to Afghanistan in the first place, will be carrying on.
Douglas Ollivant, a former counterinsurgency adviser to American forces in Afghanistan, said.
The post-2014 American campaign in Afghanistan is likely to be a minimalist, if long-term, enterprise—perhaps ten or fifteen thousand American trainers, pilots, and intelligence officers, as well as Special Forces troops to kill suspected terrorists.
Indeed, some of the early indications are that the strategy is beginning to work: these days, almost half of the military operations that unfold in Afghanistan are led by Afghans.
Sometimes, that participation is minimal: Afghan soldiers might be walking on a patrol through a village in eastern Afghanistan, but that patrol was planned, supplied, and protected by the Americans.
In 2010, during the military offensive into the Taliban-held town of Marjah, in southern Afghanistan, American officers insisted that the operation was “Afghan-led,” which was preposterous.
It’s not unlike raising teen-agers,” Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Taylor told me one night at a base in eastern Afghanistan.
The son of a Pashtun father and a Tajik mother, he represents Afghanistan’s two largest ethnic groups.
One of those is Lester Grau, the author of “The Bear Went Over the Mountain,” a history of the Soviet war in Afghanistan and a civilian employee of the U.
The Afghan state would probably have held together, and there probably wouldn’t have been a civil war.
Army Web site, Grau and a co-author argue that the challenges faced by the United States in Afghanistan appear to be far smaller than those faced by the Soviet Union in 1989.
The international community—having seen Afghanistan implode once before—also appears to be far more committed to the state’s survival, Grau noted.
By October, 2012, the number of American troops deployed in Afghanistan will be sixty-eight thousand, and General Karimi, the Afghan Army’s chief of staff, told me that he would like those troops to stay on.
Some Western and Afghan experts say that fifteen thousand American troops would not be enough to secure Afghanistan, particularly when it comes to the use of airpower.
On a Friday afternoon in May, Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Taylor, the leader of eight hundred American troops in eastern Afghanistan, arrived at a meeting of the government of Kushamond.
In eleven years, countless meetings in Afghanistan have begun this way: with a request for aid.
On March 15th, the Taliban’s leadership posted a statement on the group’s Web site, announcing that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was suspending talks with the Americans.
In a statement, released last year, Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban leader, had said that the Taliban no longer desired a monopoly on power in a post-American Afghanistan—meaning, presumably, that the Taliban would be willing to share power.
This most recent statement went even further, proclaiming that the Taliban had a vision for life after the war.
In that case, the Taliban would be given effective control over the eastern and southern regions of Afghanistan, where they enjoy the most public support.
Taliban, such a deal could possibly create the conditions for civil war.
If the Taliban are left armed and recognized as the legitimate controllers of the south, that means the partition of Afghanistan,” Amrullah Saleh, one of the leaders of the anti-Karzai opposition and a former member of Jamiat-e-Islami, told me.
One political change that might prevent civil war, some opposition leaders say, would be the imposition of a federal system in which power would devolve to the provinces.
As it is, many of the most prominent leaders of Afghanistan’s minority groups appear to be preparing for civil war.
You do not wake up one morning and the radio says it’s civil war,” Saleh told me.
In Kunduz, there is already a civil war.
After years of stalemate, Americans wonder what eleven years of war in Afghanistan have achieved.
In Afghanistan, this question is heard less often, even among Afghans who believe it’s time for the Americans to leave.
Real achievements are not hard to find in Afghanistan.
Like few other groups in the country, the Hazaras have seized on the educational opportunities offered in post-2001 Afghanistan; Hazara girls have one of the highest high-school graduation rates in the country, and Hazara women have become some of the most visible symbols of the new Afghanistan.
Class,” he said, “does Afghanistan have a bright future?
Afghanistan, and for a conflict that’s been seemingly forgotten by most Americans who’ve grown weary of war, it seems fitting that the anniversary should be overshadowed by a domestic story: the federal government shutdown.
American troops in Afghanistan.
That is more, by far, than at any time during the first seven years of the war, yet these days, they garner scant news coverage.
Most recently, Syria’s civil war and the use of chemical weapons as well as the federal government shutdown have buried Afghanistan news, even as Americans continue to die — four were killed within a week in so-called insider attacks just at the end of September.
There is a bloody war happening, and no one is talking about it,” said Ahmad Majidyar, an Afghanistan expert at the American Enterprise Institute and a frequent adviser to the U.
The Associted Press — more than during any of the first six years of the war.

President Obama talks about Afghanistan strategy maybe only once in a year,” Majidyar said.
When he does talk about it, he talks about the end of the war and talks only of positive things.
A White House spokesman declined to discuss whether Obama is avoiding public discussion of Afghanistan, instead issuing a statement about negotiations over a bilateral security agreement to keep American troops in Afghanistan past the end of 2014.
Media interest in the war has been waning for years, driven by Obama’s silence on the issue since the end of his troop surge, said A.
Trevor Thrall, a professor at George Mason University and the author of War in the Media Age, which explores the intersection of the military, media and public opinion in conflicts since the Vietnam War.
Thrall said it isn’t the first time a president has tried to bury news about Afghanistan.
Bush stopped talking about Afghanistan almost immediately after he shifted focus to Iraq,” he said.
Afghanistan was truly a forgotten war  when  Obama took over and it became it again after the surge was over.
In 2010, during the surge, it was hard for a reporter to find a cot at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan, with journalists from around the world packed tightly into a tent that served as a media center, even battling over access to electrical outlets.
Ray Odierno, the former top military commander in Iraq, said the lack of public awareness worries him because international engagement is key to sustaining gains made in Afghanistan.
If we continue on this  path, I think Afghanistan can become a success story, and I worry that’s not being talked about at all,” he said.
Afghanistan was considered the “good war” with the just cause, the one everyone could get behind.
With its clear links to the 9 11 attacks, as opposed to Iraq’s, based as it was later learned on faulty intelligence, the war in Afghanistan was much more popular at first, Majidyar said.
Because of this, though, it also never generated the attention — or the outrage — of the Iraq war, which led to worldwide protests and heated debates of a kind never seen in relation to Afghanistan.
But now, many see Afghanistan as the foreign policy guest that has long overstayed its welcome.
America and its Western allies have gone from war fatigue to numbness.
There’s a “sense of exhaustion” among long-time Afghan hands in aid organizations and foreign service positions, who are often “tired and, in some cases, deeply fed up” with the situation in Afghanistan, said Graeme Smith, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst in Afghanistan and author of “The Dogs Are Eating Them Now: Our War in Afghanistan.
Public ambivalence about Afghanistan stems in part from the failures of the past few years, which, despite the surge of foreign troops, saw a sharp rise in casualties; violence remained above the pre-surge levels after the additional forces left, Smith said.
The short attention span of the West is such that if the problem hasn’t been solved by now, maybe they figure it’s unsolvable, which is too bad because I think what Afghanistan needs right now is continued engagement,” Smith said.
In a lot of ways, a lot of Afghanistan’s future depends on whether Western nations feel guilty enough about the mess they made to stay involved.
Troops still serving in Afghanistan have mixed feelings about the lack of attention.
A small town in Wisconsin is a far cry from the civil war-ravaged fields of northern Syria.
Our longest war just got even longer.
When Congress voted to authorize the war way back in 2001, they surely didn’t know they were authorizing a 15-year occupation.
Jeff Merkley  D-OR  has a bill calling for a congressional vote on any US troop presence in Afghanistan after 2014.
As the senator said in response to the president’s announcement, “Automatic renewal is fine for Netflix and gym memberships, but it is not the right approach when it comes to war.
While it’s encouraging that the administration is reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan and setting a clear timeline for withdrawal, it’s not good enough.
