In the near future Earth has been devastated by drought and famine, causing a scarcity in food and extreme changes in climate.
When humanity is facing extinction, a mysterious rip in the space-time continuum is discovered, giving mankind the opportunity to widen their lifespan.
A group of explorers must travel beyond our solar system in search of a planet that can sustain life.
The crew of the Endurance are required to think bigger and go further than any human in history as they embark on an interstellar voyage, into the unknown.
However, through the wormhole, one hour is the equivalent of seven years back on Earth, so the mission won t work if the people on Earth are dead by the time they pull it off.
And Coop, the pilot of the Endurance, must decide between seeing his children again and the future of the human race.
Christopher Nolan cast Matthew McConaughey after seeing his performance in Mud  2012 .
It was an  ideal moment  for Nolan when they landed a Texas native, McConaughey, for the lead role.
It was McConaughey s venture into indie films that helped land him the role.
I didn t know how much potential he had until I saw Mud  2012 .
Brand : Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.
Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan .
Starring Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway , Jessica Chastain , and Michael Caine , the film features a team of space travelers who travel through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet.
It was written by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan, Christopher combined his idea with an existing script by his brother that was developed in 2007 for Paramount Pictures and producer Lynda Obst .
Nolan is producing the film with Obst and Emma Thomas .
Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne , whose works inspired the film, acted as both an executive producer and a scientific consultant for the film.
Warner Bros.
Nolan s previous films, negotiated with Paramount, traditionally a rival studio, to have a financial stake in Interstellar.
The three companies co-financed the film, and the production companies Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions were enlisted.
The director also hired cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema since his long-time collaborator Wally Pfister was busy working on Transcendence , his directorial debut.
Interstellar was filmed with a combination of anamorphic 35 mm and IMAX 70 mm film photography.
Filming took place in the last quarter of 2013 in locations in the province of Alberta, Canada , in southern Iceland , and in Los Angeles, California.
The visual effects company Double Negative created visual effects for Interstellar.
Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.
Commercially, it is scheduled for a limited release in North America  United States and Canada  on November 5, 2014 and a wide release on November 7, 2014.
It will also be released in Belgium, France and Switzerland on November 5, 2014 and in additional territories in the following days, including the United Kingdom on November 7, 2014.
For the limited release in North America, it will be released in 70 mm and 35 mm film formats in approximately 240 theaters which still project the formats, including at least 41 70 mm IMAX theaters.
For the wide release, it will expand to theaters that will show it in digital format.
Paramount Pictures will distribute the film in North America, and Warner Bros.
When a wormhole  which can theoretically connect widely separated regions of spacetime   is discovered, explorers and scientists unite to embark on a voyage through it, transcending the normal limits of human space travel.
4] Among the travellers is a widowed engineer, Cooper  McConaughey , who must decide whether or not to leave his two children behind to join the voyage and attempt to save humanity from an environmentally devastated Earth  by finding a new habitable planet in another galaxy.
Director Christopher Nolan said he became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after seeing him in an early cut of the 2012 film Mud ,  which he had an opportunity to see since he was friends with one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.
9] While McConaughey was in New Orleans, Louisiana filming for the TV series True Detective , Nolan invited the actor to visit him at his home.
Anne Hathaway was also invited to Nolan s home, where she read the script for Interstellar.
18] Paramount announced in April 2013 that both actors were cast in the film s starring roles.
19] Nolan called McConaughey s character an everyman with whom  the audience could experience the story .
20] Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was filming Miss Julie in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.
Other well-known actors eventually joined what would become  an all-star cast .
21] Actor Irrfan Khan said he declined a role since he wanted to be in India for the releases of The Lunchbox and D-Day .
22] Actor Matt Damon was cast in late August 2013 in a small role and filmed his scenes in Iceland.
The premise for Interstellar was conceived by film producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne , who collaborated on the 1997 film Contact .
9] Based on Thorne s work, the two conceived a scenario about  the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans  that would attract filmmaker Steven Spielberg  s interest in directing.
23] The film began development in June 2006 when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science fiction film based on Thorne s treatment.
Obst was attached to produce the film, which Variety said would  take several years to come together  before Spielberg directed it.
24] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay for Interstellar.
Steven Spielberg moved his production company DreamWorks in 2009 from Paramount to The Walt Disney Company , and Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar.
Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who ultimately joined the project in 2012.
26] Christopher Nolan met with Kip Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.
3] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros.
Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.
27] Nolan said he wanted to encourage again the goal of human spaceflight .
5] He intended to write a screenplay based on his own idea that he would merge with his brother s screenplay.
28] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions .
29] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan will earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of what Interstellar grosses.
30] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA as well as the private space program SpaceX .
Though Paramount and Warner Bros.
Nolan s Batman films and works with Nolan s Syncopy, sought a stake in Nolan s production of Interstellar for Paramount.
Warner Bros.
Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise and to have a stake in a future film based on the TV series South Park .
Warner Bros.
Paramount co-finance  a to-be-determined A-list Warners property .
31] In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros.
25 percent of the film s production.
Legendary reportedly agreed to forego financing for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.
Screenwriter Jonathan Nolan was hired by director Steven Spielberg to write a script for Interstellar, and he worked on it for four years.
9] To learn the science, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology while writing the script.
33] Jonathan said he was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a manned mission to Mars .
The screenwriter found inspiration in science fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E  2008  and Avatar  2009 .
Entertainment Weekly said,  He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.   Jonathan s brother, director Christopher Nolan, had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and rewrite it with new ideas.
Christopher kept in place Jonathan s conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource-depleted Earth in the near future.
The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s.
Christopher instead revised the rest of the script in which a team travels into space.
Nolan filmed Interstellar with anamorphic 35mm and IMAX film photography.
4] Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister , Nolan s cinematographer on all of his past films, was working on his directorial debut, Transcendence .
34] IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar more than any of Nolan s previous films.
To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery, the director had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.
17] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be handheld for shooting interior scenes.
9] Some of the film s sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nosecone of a Learjet .
Nolan, who is known to keep details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar.
The Wall Street Journal reported,  The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy.   As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora s Letter,  Flora being one of Nolan s four children with producer Emma Thomas.
The film s principal photography was scheduled to last for four months.
13] It began on August 6, 2013 in the province of Alberta, Canada .
32] Towns in Alberta where filming took place included Nanton , Longview , Lethbridge , and Okotoks .
In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza.
37] For a cornfield scene, Nolan sought to grow corn, which he learned was feasible from his involvement as producer on Man of Steel  2013 .
3] Production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene,  intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s United States.
3] Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey s character were also filmed in Fort Macleod , where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air.
38] Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013 and involved hundreds of extras as well as approximately 130 crew members, most of them local.
Filming also took place in Iceland , where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for his 2005 film Batman Begins .
39] The crew transported mock spaceships weighing approximately 10,000 pounds  4,500 kg  to the country,  which was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and one covered in water.
9] A two-week Iceland shoot was scheduled  and a crew of approximately 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on it.
Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur .
40]  While filming in Iceland, actor Anne Hathaway almost suffered hypothermia since her dry suit in a water scene was not secure.
After the Iceland shoot, the crew moved to Los Angeles to film for 54 days.
Filming in California was relatively unusual since California s tax credit was not available for films with a budget greater than $75 million.
Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites , the Los Angeles Convention Center , a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City , and a private residence in Altadena .
42] Filming concluded in December 2013, and Nolan started editing the film for its release in 2014.
Legendary Pictures.
Interstellar features three spacecraft: the Ranger, the Endurance, and the Lander.
The Ranger s function is similar to the space shuttle  s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres.
The Endurance, the crew s mother ship , has a circular structure formed by 12 capsules: four with planetary colonization equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs and habitation.
Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station :  It s a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need back-up systems and tangible switches. It s really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.  Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with colonization equipment to planetary surfaces.
Crowley compared it to  a heavy Russian helicopter .
The film also features two robots, CASE and TARS.
Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a five-foot quadrilateral design.
The director said,  It has a very complicated design philosophy. It s based on mathematics. You ve got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it s all proportional.  Actor Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film and his voicing for CASE was replaced.
Sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo mixed the sound for Interstellar, supervised by sound editor Richard King .
44] Christopher Nolan said he sought to mix the film s sound to take maximum advantage of current sound equipment in theaters.
45] Nolan paid close attention to designing the sound mix, for instance focusing on what buttons being pressed with astronaut-suit gloves would sound like.
Composer Hans Zimmer , who scored Nolan s Batman film trilogy, also scored Interstellar.
Zimmer and Nolan plan to move away from the trilogy s scores and to come up with a unique one.
Zimmer said,  The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people s movies a bit, so it s time to reinvent. The endless string  need to go by the wayside, the big drums are probably in the bin.   Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer  one page of text  that  had more to do with  story than the plot of the movie .
48] Nolan said he told Zimmer,  I said,  I am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It s going to tell you the fable at the center of the story. You work for one day, then play me what you have written,  and he embraced what Zimmer composed.
Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, which was three times more than for Inception.
The visual effects company Double Negative , which developed effects for Nolan s 2010 film Inception , worked on Interstellar.
49] Visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin said the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan s The Dark Knight Rises or Inception, but that for Interstellar, they created the effects first, so digital projectors could be used to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens .
Director Christopher Nolan said influences on Interstellar included the  key touchstones  of science fiction cinema; Metropolis  1927 , 2001: A Space Odyssey  1968 , and Blade Runner  1982 .
The movies you grow up with, the culture you absorb through the decades, becomes part of your expectations while watching a film.
So you can t make any film in a vacuum.
Those always stuck in my head as being how you need to approach science-fiction.
Nolan compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre  1948 , as a film about human nature.
52] He also sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg s Jaws  1975  and Close Encounters of the Third Kind  1977 .
When you say you re making a family film,  he said,  it has all these pejorative connotations that it ll be somehow soft.
But when I was a kid, these were family films in the best sense, and they were as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum.
He also cited the space drama The Right Stuff  1983  as an example to follow, and screened it for the crew before production.
9] To emulate that film, he sought to capture reflection on the Interstellar astronauts  visors.
For further inspiration grounded in real-world space travel, the director also invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.
Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was a scientific consultant for the film, to ensure the depictions of wormholes and relativity were as accurate as possible.
In creating the wormhole and black hole, Dr.
Thorne collaborated with visual effect supervisor Paul Franklin and a team of 30 computer effects artists at Double Negative.
Thorne would provide pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the artists, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena.
Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, and ultimately resulted in 800 terabytes of data.
The resulting visual effect provided Dr.
Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and will lead to the creation of two scientific papers ; one for the astrophysics community and one for the computer graphics community.
Christopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole wouldn t be visually comprehensible to an audience and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance.
However Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable provided that he maintained consistent camera perspectives,  What we found was as long as we didn’t change the point of view too much, the camera position, we could get something very understandable .
The teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December 14, 2013 and featured clips related to space exploration , accommodated by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey  s character of Cooper.
C.
5 million views on YouTube .
58] The studio began airing TV spots for the film at the end of September 2014, expanding on the early focus on McConaughey, who the Los Angeles Times said had high visibility to the public after winning an Academy Award for Dallas Buyers Club and for an acclaimed performance on the TV series True Detective .
A TV spot aired during Sunday Night Football to appeal to a broad audience.
Christopher Nolan and Matthew McConaughey made their first appearances at Comic-Con in July 2014 to promote Interstellar.
The Hollywood Reporter said that prior to Nolan s appearance, he had  not spoken about his new movie at all .
60] The pair participated in a brief discussion and screened a new trailer of the film.
61] In the same month, Paramount Pictures launched a complex interactive Interstellar website in July 2014.
62] The Hollywood Reporter said the website was  both cryptic and, just maybe, filled with hidden meaning .
It reported that online users uncovered a star chart related to the Apollo 11 moon landing.
By October 2014, Paramount partnered with Google to promote Interstellar across multiple platforms.
64] The film s website was relaunched to be a digital hub hosted on a Google domain.
65] The website debuted the film s final trailer, and allowed visitors navigate theater locations and schedules to help them plan to see Interstellar in certain formats.
66] It also provided navigation of film-related content across Google platforms, collected feedback from film audiences, and linked to a mobile app.
65] The app, initially released by Paramount Digital Entertainment in September 2014, featured a game in which players could build solar system models and use a flight simulator for space travel.
67] The Paramount-Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user-generated content to be available in 2015.
Through the partnership, the cast of Interstellar will also talk about the film through the video chat platform Google Hangouts .
The initiative Google for Education will also use the film as a basis for promoting lesson plans for math science in schools around the United States.
Paramount is providing a virtual reality walkthrough of the Endurance spacecraft using Oculus Rift technology.
It is hosting the walkthrough sequentially in four theaters, in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, from October 6, 2014 through November 19, 2014.
68]  The publisher Running Press will release Interstellar: Beyond Time and Space, a book by Mark Cotta Vaz about the making of the film, on November 11, 2014.
70] On November 7, 2014, W.
W.
Norton & Company will release The Science of Interstellar, a book by Kip Thorne , a theoretical physicist who was a scientific adviser and executive producer for the film.
Prior to Interstellar  ​s public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014 at an IMAX theater in Lincoln Square, Manhattan .
72] Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry s filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22, 2014.
10] On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild .
Actors McConaughey, Chastain, and Hathaway appeared afterward for a Q&A session.
73] The film officially premiered on October 26, 2014 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los, Angeles, California.
Paramount imposed a review embargo for the advance screenings until October 27, 2014.
Aside from the embargo, very positive messages about the film were posted on Twitter .
Interstellar is scheduled for a limited release in North America  United States and Canada  on November 5, 2014 and wide release on November 7, 2014.
76] The film will also be released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, 2014 and in additional territories in the following days, including the United Kingdom on November 7, 2014.
77] For the limited North America release, Interstellar will be projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in approximately 240 theaters that still support those formats, including at least 41 70 mm IMAX theaters.
2] A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California to display the format.
The film s wide release will expand to theaters that will show it digitally.
66] Paramount Pictures will distribute the film in North America, and Warner Bros.
4] The film is expected to be released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide which will be the widest global release ever in IMAX cinemas.
Interstellar is an exception to Paramount Pictures  s goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format.
80] The Hollywood Reporter said the initiative to project Interstellar from film would help preserve an endangered format,  an initiative supported by Christopher Nolan, J.
J.
Abrams , Quentin Tarantino , Judd Apatow , and other filmmakers.
81] The Reporter said that several theater owners saw the initiative as  backward , as nearly all theaters in the United States have been converted to digital projection.
In North America, Interstellar and Big Hero 6 will open the same weekend of November 7–9, 2014, with both forecast to earn between $55 million and $60 million.
TheWrap said the pairing was  potentially a close race .
It said Interstellar would appeal to men while Big Hero 6 would appeal to families.
83] Scott Mendelson of Forbes called the race between the two films a  tight one  and compared it to competitions between Shrek 2 and The Day After Tomorrow as well as Monsters University and World War Z .
84] Fandango reported that pre-sales for Interstellar were outpacing Christopher Nolan s earlier film Inception as well as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , released earlier in 2014.
Interstellar also became the biggest pre-seller at the TCL Chinese Theatre.
The film review website Metacritic surveyed 11 critics and assessed 8 reviews as positive, 2 as mixed, and 1 as negative.
It gave an aggregate score of 77 out of 100, which it said indicated  generally favorable reviews .
89] The similar website Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 26 critics and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 18 as positive and 8 as negative.
2 out of 10.
Scott Foundas, chief film critic at Variety , called Interstellar  as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done .
Foundas said the film also felt more personal than Nolan s previous films.
Interstellar was nominated for Original Score for the Hollywood Music in Media Awards, contending with six other films.
The advisory board received a five-minute trailer for the film that included Hans Zimmer  s music.
In the month leading up to Interstellar  ​s release, parody video mashups referencing the film were created with the space-related films Spaceballs  1987  and WALL-E  2008 .
Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros.

No Friends?
Inconceivable!

The story is ever-ambitious, sometimes riveting and thought-provoking, but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects.
Reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place alongside  The Wizard of Oz,   2001,   Close Encounters of the Third Kind  and  Gravity  in the canon of Hollywood s visionary sci-fi head trips.
May represent an apotheosis of sorts, as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director.
A bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike.
Nolan s aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution.
Some of the parts of this mega-fantasy are awesome.
The sum of all parts?
Not so stellar.
Interstellar is an imperfect film, but like its central characters, aims about as high as one can.
The ambition, execution, and craftsmanship are all to be admired.
So few blockbusters have an IQ over 50.
It s important to celebrate this one, even if it comes up a little short.
Not every film need address the possibility of human extinction with the gung-ho silliness of Armageddon, but at least that was a space adventure.
This is a science report.
Love or hate Interstellar - or fall, like me, into a wishy-washy middle ground - you will feel like you ve been on a grand journey by the end.
I was moved by Interstellar, and there are stretches where it is as good and as pure as anything Nolan s made.
It combines abstruse ideas about gravity, matter and time with old fashioned, hyper-charged family melodrama.
The movie is most powerful when it s at its least abstract.
Interstellar would be a stunning piece of cinema if you weren t supposed to think about it.
What pulls you in is its hugely confident architecture as a piece of storytelling - its brave fictitiousness.
Nolan comes very close here, one might almost say agonisingly close, to forging his masterpiece.
An emotional powerhouse when it isn t hokey, and a stunning spectacle when it doesn t get bogged down in plot logistics,  Interstellar  binds its strengths and weaknesses into a riveting whole.
A spine-tingling blend of brains and heart, a high concept sci-fi opera that s as unafraid of cerebral ideas as it is of heart-on-sleeve emotion.
Nolan s love letter to space travel and the exploration of the stars may require some patience, but it offers an incredible emotional payoff along with its visual spectacle.
It s a movie designed for people who watched the bedroom sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey and wished there was more exposition about who built the room, how, why and what thread count was on that bed.

Remember those solar system mobiles and models that populated your science classrooms?
Remember how you ripped off Pluto in anger once some jerks  OK, fine, astronomers  decided it was now a just “dwarf planet”?
Wait, you didn’t do that?
OK, that’s cool.
However, for those of us who would stare at those mobiles and dream of building universes of our own, the new game promoting director Christopher Nolan’s upcoming space epic Interstellar allows those fantasies to come true.
The Interstellar game  no other name necessary  is a solar system model builder, yes, but it’s also a flight simulator that lets you explore your galaxy and those made by others.
You can’t actually shoot Matthew McConaughey into space, but the game does allow you to explore the galaxy much like his character does in the movie thanks to input from the film’s scientific advisor, theoretical physicist Kip Thorne .
Interstellar, from what we’ve gathered from the mysterious trailers released so far, ponders what happens when we must wander the cosmos in search of a hospitable planet.
Building on that theme, the free online game and mobile app lets you create galaxies that might contain those planets.
You add planets, moons, and asteroids, and determine their locations and orbits.
Go big, stay small, change a planet’s surface—do whatever you want.
You can even change the size and colors of your heavenly bodies.
There’s also a cool red button you can push to “destroy” planets you don’t want.
Create your world and watch it spin.
Once your perfect universe is finished, you can pilot your own starship through space.
It feels a bit like a NASA simulator turned into a game and—because it uses real science—requires that you travel the way an exploratory crew would have to.
Navigating around black holes to avoid being drawn into the void?
Yes.
Avoiding crashing into various bodies?
That too.
Using gravity to slingshot around and save fuel?
You got it.
You’ve even got the option of traveling through wormholes.
It’s like Galaga, but with Newtonian physics.
There are no pew!
The game also provides the option of sharing your solar system for others to explore and traveling through those made by your friends.
It doesn’t offer the grand majesty of Nolan’s movie —that doesn’t drop until Nov.
7—but it’ll do until then.
Check out a trailer for the app above, then head here to play the game yourself.

I was moved by Interstellar, and there are stretches where it is as good and as pure as anything Nolan s made.
Brainy and exciting at the same time, Interstellar invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product.
What pulls you in is its hugely confident architecture as a piece of storytelling – its brave fictitiousness.
It’s a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour.

Chris Nolan’s Interstellar isn’t just a movie about a small group of astronauts attempting to save the world.
It also acts as a metaphor, artistically and commercially, for saving Hollywood as well.
In an era where it feels like Hollywood is allergic to original ideas especially at the blockbuster level, Chris Nolan has become the poster child for big-budget original spectaculars.
That may not be fair, either to Nolan or the other interesting directors who also dabble in original works more often than not in the multiplex arena  M.
As such the box office performance for Christopher Nolan’s newest mega-budget opus isn’t going to be measured merely against the demands in regards to budget and reasonable expectations.
It will be a measuring stick of sorts for the potential for live-action big-budget blockbuster entertainments that aren’t based on a comic book, young-adult lit fantasy, or other pre-sold property of some kind.
Warner Bros.
Considering how much IMAX is going to rake in from the picture, if I were working for Paramount or Warner Bros.
I would have personally asked IMAX Corp.
I digress.
The budget came it at $165 million, which is pretty high for an original property but didn’t approach the likes of Inception  $190m , 2012  $200m , and Avatar  $235m .
Interstellar will actually grab quite a bit of upfront demand via a two-day early sneak release that will take place exclusively in around 300 theaters showing the picture in old-school 35mm or 70mm film  as opposed to DLP .
The best case scenario, and this isn’t a prediction per-se, is that Interstellar performs like, you guessed it, Inception.
Chris Nolan’s late-summer 2010 caper capitalized on a weak summer slate and being the last big movie of the summer.
5m worldwide cume.
But that film had a bigger star in Leonardo DiCaprio  McConaughey’s post “McConaissance” box office pull hasn’t been tested  and a more visceral action-based premise involving dream logic, shoot-outs and car chases, plus a buzzy zero-gravity fight scene.
The marketing has been refreshingly light on spoilers  and yes I finally watched the later trailers and can confirm that they are pretty safe  but also light on visual wowser moments that will get people talking.
Now if the film clicks with audiences then the spoiler-light campaign will help the box office over the long haul, as the sense of discovery will improve the word-of-mouth and increase the likelihood of repeat viewings.
But come what may, it’s tough to see a situation where Interstellar makes less than $150m domestic and $415m worldwide, which would be the break-even point for the $165m production.
Yes, it’s in 2D but it will be a major player in China and those IMAX screens are going to be packed around the world.
As always, we’ll know when we know.
Enough of Interstellar is thoughtful, engaging, and visually dynamic that it feels almost petty to acknowledge that the picture doesn’t quite hold together as a movie.
Chris Nolan is one of the more talented directors working in the industry right now, and he has directed some of my favorite films of the last fifteen years.
Interstellar is certainly a noble effort that wears its heart on its sleeve and arguably should still be seen on the biggest IMAX screen possible if you had the slightest interest in the project leading up to its release.
But in terms of what Mr.
Nolan is capable of and in terms of the film viewed in a relative vacuum, Interstellar is not quite a success.
I can’t insult those involved by grading on an admiration-based curve.
The plot of Interstellar, and I’ll try not to reveal anything not in the first and second trailers, involves an Earth on the verge of extinction after what amounts to a second “Dust Bowl” that decimates the world’s agriculture.
Be it through starvation or eventual suffocation, humanity’s days are numbered.
The core dilemma, and it is a potent one, involves a widowed father leaving his children behind, presumably forever, in order to potentially save their lives and the entire species.
It’s clear that Nolan and company intend the film to be a look at how we as a country  or planet  have allowed our ambitions to discover and explore to dwindle as world events have forced us to focus on mere survival; a retreat to mere physiological needs.
There are a few dazzling images and at least one solid action sequence late in the game, and it is always fun to see the real-world implications of somewhat abstract scientific theory.
Yet the film feels less like a grand original work than it does a buttoned-down and overly “realistic” variation on “go into space to save the world” pictures such as  among others  The Core, Sunshine, and even yes Lost in Space  the 1998 movie, although I’m sure the original television show applies as well .
If you strip away the gravitas and periodic scope of the “outside of the space shuttle” imagery, you’ll notice that very little happens in the long second and third acts of the picture.
And the dialogue is mostly plot-centric, which is problematic mostly because they keep repeating the same core scientific ideas and would-be themes over the course of the film.
Much of the outer space photography, especially in the shuttle itself, feels downright claustrophobic and close-up happy, which may-well be intentional but is unfortunate considering the scale of the various film stocks  IMAX and 65mm film among others  Mr.
When the focus is on the core tragedy, that of a loving father potentially leaving his children forever with no guarantee that his sacrifice won’t be in vain or that he won’t merely save the generation after them, Interstellar occasionally qualifies as a gut-punch.
Moreover, many of the characters aren’t terribly engaging despite the fine and dedicated cast.
It’s well-acted by all parties, but too many of the supporting characters don’t resonate beyond scientific talking heads.
Michael Caine gives good exposition as expected, and both Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck are hauntingly good as  no spoilers  desperate survivors of what may be the last generation of humanity.
Anne Hathaway gets but one terrific monologue about quantifying human emotion while the rest of the outer-space NASA folks are relatively dry  that Hathaway is the main female character yet is, slight spoiler, both distracted by would-be love and needs to be rescued costs the film a few points .
McConaughey is fine as a would-be audience surrogate, and he benefits from having most of the best lines and most of the major emotional beats.
I appreciated the film’s final reel, which is arguably the only portion that feels wholly fresh, even if I don’t entirely get how 2+2 got to 4.
The film starts and ends relatively well, but what happens in between too-often feels like a stripped-down variation of any number of other films  yes I am intentionally being vague to avoid spoilers .
It is no secret that Chris Nolan and company were inspired by the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and I can’t help-but-wonder if this was a case, at least in terms of visuals and certain key themes, of too much emulation with not enough variation.
Interstellar has its heart in the right place in terms of its themes, its overall optimism, and its ambitions.
Shot in a variety of formats  35mm film, 65mm film, and IMAX film , the picture looks gorgeous from beginning to end.
But the quality of the ideas and a few powerful and or jaw-dropping moments cannot entirely compensate for relative shortcomings once the picture gets into space.
It breaks my heart to not be swept up with this one.
I did not walk in with the expectation of a cinematic experience on par with Gravity or even Contact, but nor did I expect such an overall uninspiring experience.
Despite penning what amounts to a “mixed-negative” review, I would never tell anyone not to see it.
In-fact I would recommend seeing it on the biggest IMAX screen you can find both to encourage such film-making pursuits and to encourage glorious 2D IMAX.
It is a well-acted film of ambition and intelligence, albeit one that falls short in overall visceral and overall emotional impact.
It is a film about interstellar travel that is ironically at its strongest when it remains Earthbound.
Good is not the enemy of perfect, but Interstellar is not good enough.

Also, check out my archives for older work HERE .
Too many of Nolan’s projects have been packed with almost too much ambition.
Think about how much better The Dark Knight Rises would have been had it not been clogged with so many unnecessary characters  even if some of them, like Catwoman, were pretty fun .
Inception also suffers from an abundance of ambition — particularly in some of the latter portions of the film where it really starts to drag.
This reviewer has lost all credibility essentially saying Contact and Gravity were better films.
Gravity was a joke of a film.
There was not a shred of scientific accuracy in that movie, there were so many flaws, it was just a visual “masterpiece”, if you can even call it that.
The effects in the 1977 Star Wars were better than gravity.
Interstellar is based on real physics, sorry that that may bore you, but it is a sign of how far society’s value for smart and educational films has fallen.
More for the Marvel generation I suppose.
Opinions are subjective.
Even if Mr.
Mendelson liked Gravity and Contact more than Interstellar, that is still his subjective opinion.
For you to cry that he’s “lost all credibility”  whatever that even means  because he enjoyed two similar-themed movies over this one is kind of a ludicrous sentiment.
I enjoyed Man of Steel more than Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3, and most people I’ve come across consider Man of Steel to be an inferior film to those two.
If that causes me to “lose all credibility” with someone, I’m ok with that because I’m not a crazy person.
No.
You missed the point.
Mendelson like other critics have criticized this movie because as they readily admit they were unable to understand the science or the technical arguments of wormholes and black holes in the movie.
This is evidenced by Mendelson’s comment: “I don’t entirely get how 2+2 got to 4.
I will presume a second viewing and or a post-release article from Kip Thorne or Degrasse Tyson will help clear this up, and it is okay if I don’t “get” every scientific detail”, this is influenced their whole impression of the film.
The bottom line is if you don’t understand the plot of a film, you really shouldn’t be writing lengthy reviews.
I don’t speak Italian, so you shouldn’t trust my reviews of an Italian-language film!
Why don’t you all get a few books on general relativity, Thorne has written several, and at least try to make an effort to understand the arguments in the movie, instead of saying silly things like Gravity was better.
No, you liked Gravity better because Cuaron dumbed the film down to the point where it was just about visuals.
He dumbed it down so much that all of the science in the movie was fraudulent.
This is the first movie where black holes, wormholes, spacetime curvature, singularities, and all the effects of general relativity based on Einstein’s equations have been displayed accurately and realistically, and we should celebrate it for that alone, instead of making silly comments like it is not as good as Gravity or Contact.
I appreciate you explaining yourself in this review.
I’ll have to truly decide whether I think you’re right after I’ve seen the film.
However, I do hope you know you are in the minority  THUS far  because the other reviews I’ve seen, or reactions I’ve heard of have said the complete opposite.
6 on IMBD, and 78 on metacritic and you still ended up in the minority with your overall dislike for the film.
So I can’t say I’m surprised you don’t like Nolan’s more ambitious films  bar Inception .
On Chris Nolan movies: I often feel I’m asked to sit and let plots simmer for way too long.
As I’ve watched his movies I’ve always thought how much could have been edited out or told more efficiently.
I wanted to like Inception but I found it too long and meandering.
I love the premise of Interstellar, but reading that the movie “rushes into space only to slow to a relative crawl once it gets there” kills my enthusiasm for it.
For whatever reason Nolan prefers to squander a good pace and forcing one to sit through a long inconsequential moment.
Ughh.
Here comes the Nolan fanboy brigade telling you you’re wrong before they see the movie.
I’m checking the film out opening night, but my anticipation has definitely dwindled based on the generally mixed reviews.
Let them come, it helps my traffic.
If I’m going to dislike a movie I was hoping to love, I might as well get something from my dislike.
While you’re right about this film success being the guage for whether or not original stuff can still succeed, it does feel like we get one of those at least once a year.
It’s not like they aren’t happening.
How Could you  caught, caught  say “bad” thing about a film from Nolan?
No.
You missed the point.
Mendelson like other critics have criticized this movie because as they readily admit they were unable to understand the science or the technical arguments of wormholes and black holes in the movie.
This is evidenced by Mendelson’s comment: “I don’t entirely get how 2+2 got to 4.
I will presume a second viewing and or a post-release article from Kip Thorne or Degrasse Tyson will help clear this up, and it is okay if I don’t “get” every scientific detail”, this is influenced their whole impression of the film.

This is the first movie where black holes, wormholes, spacetime curvature, singularities, and all the effects of general relativity based on Einstein’s equations have been displayed accurately and realistically, and we should celebrate it for that alone, instead of making silly comments like it is not as good as Gravity or Contact.
The finale is a bit closer to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in terms of being intentionally mystical cryptic.
R.
Well, we’ll have to see if the multi-dimensional stuff at the end is supposed to have any basis in modern theoretical physics or is just deliberately obscure like the advanced alien science in 2001 A Space Odyssey.
I guess that is Scott’s point?
You don’t need to be an expert.
As a theoretical cosmologist myself, explaining black holes and wormholes is not very difficult to do to those who have some basic first-year calculus.
But the point is, Mendelson’s comments are not consistent.
First, he claims he needs a follow-up article from Thorne, then he said when pressed on it, that 99% of the science is clearly laid out via well-known concepts.
And multi-dimensional stuff is not obscure, it is becoming an increasing cornerstone for modern-day cosmology via Kaluza-Klein theory or, extra-dimensional gravity in beyond the standard model physics models.
Learn cosmology on “The Big Bang Theory”, did we?
Preoccupied with nothing less than the notion that humankind will one day need to migrate from Earth to some other planet we can call home, Interstellar so bulges with ideas, ambitions, theories, melodrama, technical wizardry, wondrous imagery and core emotions that it was almost inevitable that some of it would stick while other stuff would fall to the floor.
Feeling very much like Christopher Nolan s personal response to his favorite film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.
While it technically occupies the realm of science fiction, this gargantuan enterprise brushes up against science fact—or at least intelligent speculation—as much as it can in an effort to make the idea of leaving and returning to our solar system as dramatically plausible as possible.
But audiences tend to be accepting of even far-fetched premises as long as the rules of the game are clear.
Where Nolan takes his big leap is in trying to invest his wannabe magnum opus with an elemental human emotion, that between parent and child; it s a genre graft that has intriguing wrinkles but remains imperfect.
Citizens of the world convinced that our planet and civilization are now in a possibly irreversible decline will readily embrace the postulation of the script, by the Nolan brothers Jonathan and Christopher, that life here will shortly be unsustainable.
Shrewdly, the writers don t reflexively blame the deterioration on the catch-all “global warming” or “climate change,” but rather upon severe “blight” resembling the Dust Bowl of the 1930s; wheat and other produce are done for, while corn growers, such as Cooper  Matthew McConaughey , may have a bit of time left.
Cooper belongs to a lost generation; a former engineer and test pilot, he expected to become an astronaut, but dire economic conditions forced the closure of NASA and the abandonment of the space program.
His precocious 10-year-old daughter Murph  Mackenzie Foy  shares her father s long-ago enthusiasm and one of the wittier scenes has an elementary school official reprimanding Murph for believing that the Apollo moon missions actually took place; history has been rewritten to insist that they were just propaganda designed to speed the bankrupting of the Soviet Union in its effort to compete  Nolan restrains himself from adding the canard that Stanley Kubrick filmed the fake moon landing .
There are echoes as well of The Wizard of Oz emanating from Cooper s remote farmhouse, which he shares with his 15-year-old son Tom  Timothee Chalamet  and Donald  John Lithgow , his late wife s father.
But, lo and behold, NASA exists after all; it s just gone underground.
Under the auspices of wise old Professor Brand  Michael Caine , the agency is secretly resurrecting its efforts to find a new home for Earthlings, with the suitably named Lazarus mission.
The path to it, Brand explains, is through a wormhole visible near Saturn, and plenty of technical dialogue and physical demonstrations are devoted to detailing how the astronauts will slip through this envelope in space and emerge in a different galaxy near another planet that might support life as we know it  eminent theoretical physicist Kip Thorne receives executive producer credit for his contributions to this and other astronomical aspects of the story .
Cooper cannot resist the invitation to pilot this secret mission, but the angst of having to leave his family behind, specifically Murph, gives him the emotional bends.
I m coming back,” he gravely intones, echoing The Terminator, but even if he does return, it seems that, on the other side, he and his crew will age at just a fraction of the rate that Earthlings do at home.
Murph is inconsolable and single-mindedly remains so for years.
Nolan employs a nifty little homage to 2001 at the 43-minute mark with an abrupt time-jumping cut from Cooper s pickup truck speeding away from his house to the fiery blast-off of his rocket.
Other editing ploys emphasize the complete silence of outer space, which provide a sharp contrast to a soundtrack otherwise filled with lots of talk and Hans Zimmer s often soaring, sometimes domineering and unconventionally orchestrated wall-of-sound score.
The small crew also consists of Brand s oddly guarded scientist daughter Amelia  Anne Hathaway , thoughtful astrophysicist Romilly  David Gyasi, in an intriguingly underplayed performance that makes you wish he had more to do , insufficiently written scientist and co-pilot Doyle  Wes Bentley  and, last but not least, the mobile computerized robot TARS  voiced by Bill Irwin , an occasionally humorous cross between Hal and R2D2.
What goes on among the astronauts is not especially interesting and Amelia, in particular, remains an annoyingly vague and unpersuasive character in contrast to McConaughey s exuberant, if regret-laden, mission leader, a role the actor invests with vigor and palpable feeling.
It s a two-year trip out to Saturn, during which the crew hibernates in what s cleverly called “the long nap”  a perfect title for a short story version of The Big Sleep  prior to the rough ride through the hole.
Perhaps the most implausible detail in the entire film is that, even from another galaxy, a degree of communication with home is possible.
But 23 Earth years have passed, meaning that Murph is now in her 30s and is played by Jessica Chastain.
She s just as resentful of her father having abandoned her as she ever was—it s a refrain that s seriously overplayed—while Amelia is gratified to learn that her dad, who looked 80ish when they left, is still alive.
What happens once they arrive on a barren, snowy but not entirely inhospitable rock is best left undisclosed, even if the identity of a surprise presence there of a previous voyager won t remain a secret for long.
But aside from 2001, which is obliquely referenced again in a late-on cutaway to an ancient Cooper lying in bed in a sterile room, the landmark sci-fi film that Interstellar intriguingly echoes is the 1956 Forbidden Planet; both involve a follow-up journey to a planet in a different galaxy where humans have previously landed and intensely dwell upon a father-daughter relationship.
But while the double use of this parent-child bond suggests the great importance of this theme to Nolan and represents a legitimate and rare attempt to emotionalize sci-fi, the issue is over-stressed in a narrow manner.
Murph s persistent anger at her father is essentially her only character trait and becomes tiresome; she s a closed-off character.
Her brother, played as an adult by Casey Affleck, remains too thinly developed to offer a substantial contrast to her attitude.
For all its adventurous and far-seeing aspects, Interstellar remains rather too rooted in Earthly emotions and scientific reality to truly soar and venture into the unknown, the truly dangerous.

As life on Earth deteriorates from environmental issues, a group of explorers and scientists embark on a voyage to find another viable planet.
While it reaches for the stars, director Christopher Nolan s Interstellar is a flawed masterpiece.
The story is ever-ambitious, sometimes riveting and thought-provoking, but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects.
And at nearly three hours, the film would have benefited from more judicious editing  *** out of four; rated PG-13; opens in select cities Nov.
5, nationwide Nov.
7 .
It s rare that a big-budget studio movie has such cerebral aspirations and such startling strengths and weaknesses.
The visual spectacle can be breathtaking, but the emotional, earth-bound saga fails to be as moving.
It s a heady tale about gravity and wormholes blended with a family melodrama.
Last year s Gravity touched on similar turf, but Interstellar blows the concept out in more complex — though sometimes more tedious — fashion.
For most laypeople, it s best not to get too caught up in the logistics.
Just go with the notion of mind-blowing space travel necessitated by an impending apocalypse on Earth.
S.
The world is nearly out of food.
The hardiest crop appears to be corn.
Rows of stalks thrive in a landscape that looks both familiar  and eerie.
The story isn t set at any specific date and feels as though it could happen next month, based on the architecture, clothing and cars.
Cooper  Matthew McConaughey  was once a top pilot.
He has two children, Murphy  played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain , and Tom  played in youth by Timothee Chalamet and later by Casey Affleck .
Living in a world devastated by environmental blight, Cooper stumbles on what s left of NASA and meets his old mentor, Prof.
Brand  Michael Caine , whose daughter is engineer Amelia Brand  Anne Hathaway .
Professor Brand has determined that Earth faces imminent extinction and that Cooper is the planet s last hope.
He asks him to pilot a space vessel beyond the reaches of space and time to ascertain if other planets could be habitable for Earthlings.
Complicating matters for Cooper is his devotion to his two children.
The key dilemma he faces is whether to stay with his family — and thereby save them — or save the world.
It s a fascinating conundrum posed by  writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan.
The bond between father and daughter, in particular, as beautifully played by McConaughey and Foy, is  stirring.
Cooper decides he must undertake the  mission, in the hopes of saving the species.
He s accompanied by Amelia, Doyle  Wes Bentley  and Romilly  David Gyasi  on an operation to slip through a wormhole near Saturn and search for planets that can sustain human life.
A widower, Cooper leaves his kids in care of their grandfather  John Lithgow , aware he may never see them again.
Another of the film s powerful themes is the idea that science and exploration have been set aside in a struggle for basic survival.
It s a sobering notion.
Along the way, monotonous stretches in space undercut the story s time-bending grandeur, as do minimalist exchanges between McConaughey and Hathaway, whose chemistry as space-exploring partners is lacking.
Hathaway s character is not given much dimension.
Other members of the space team are even less well-drawn, so it s hard to care what befalls them.
What little we see of the ravaged Earth is more compelling in some ways than the cosmic canvas.
The film could have used more grounded scenes.
But it seems in a hurry to get to space.
Once space and time are transcended, the film flounders.
Dull dialogue and tedious patches inside the space vessel provides a stumbling block.
What is meant as a climactic humanistic ending seems to tie things up far too neatly for a film about the complex messiness that comes with a world that has taken dramatic wrong turns.
Though its heart and mind are in the right place, for a space epic aiming for profound resonance, Interstellar falls short.
Plot Summary:  Interstellar  chronicles the adventures of a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.
From the opening scenes of sprawling cornfields accompanied by a revelrie-like brass note, it’s clear that Interstellar is working in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
It has the grand scope of Kubrick’s classic, promising to take us from humanity’s past to its distant future, and proceeds with the same stately pace that encourages you to ponder the themes it offers along the way.
It throws out plenty to think about — the nature of time and space, the place of humanity in the universe — but somewhat unexpectedly for this type of film, and for Christopher Nolan, whose work tends toward the cerebral, it explores these ideas in human terms.
Interstellar is as interested in how general relativity would affect your family life, for example, as it is in the theory itself.
Before you proceed: this review has a few spoilers, but nothing beyond what you’d glean from the preview and the first ten minutes or so of film.
Turn back now if you care about that sort of thing.
Directed by Christopher Nolan  Memento, Inception, the most recent Batman trilogy  and written with his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan, Interstellar takes place in a near future that harkens back to the recent past — like the 1950s Midwest or maybe the Dust Bowl, but with laptops and drones.
There’s very little exposition; through telling details and offhand comments, you get the sense that there’s been an environmental disaster followed by a famine, and that humanity has scaled back its ambitions to bare subsistence.
People farm corn — the one crop left unravaged by blight — watch baseball games in half-empty stands, and flee towering haboob dust storms announced by air raid sirens.
Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a NASA pilot who has turned to farming — like everyone else at the time, an odd cut to faux-documentary footage informs us.
He lives in a ramshackle house, complaining to his father  John Lithgow  about humanity’s diminished horizons and doting on his daughter Murph, played by Mackenzie Foy with a believably teenage mix of mischief and exasperation.
McConaughey eventually leaves Foy and Earth behind to scout out a new home for for the human race, but it’s their relationship that grounds the movie.
As action-filled as Nolan’s films are, they can sometimes feel abstract, like symbolic sublimations of some offscreen mental trauma.
So many of his characters get their motivation from some prior loss — the dead wives from Memento and Inception, the dead parents of Batman — that they then work through according to the game-like rules Nolan excels at, whether those rules are imposed by amnesia, consciousness, or a supervillain.
But Foy is an actual character, not a cipher, and the relationship between her and McConaughey gives the film an emotional heft that Nolan’s other work sometimes lacks.
Interstellar features some of the most beautiful images of space I’ve seen on film.
Space feels vast, with the spinning white vessel often relegated to a corner of the screen or lost against the rings of Saturn.
The depiction of a wormhole accomplishes the seemingly impossible and makes, well, nothingness look dazzling, as light slides and warps around it like water off a bubble of oil.
The black hole is even more amazing.
Present throughout the movie, it’s in these lingering shots of a tiny spacecraft floating through the galaxy that the influence of Kubrick’s Space Odyssey is most clearly felt.
Not that it’s all languorous drifting through the galaxy.
Nolan has a genius for landscape-scale action sequences, and the planets, with their alien weather and gravity, give him ample opportunity to stage them.
The camera races and plunges and, especially in IMAX, creates classic theme-park pit-of-your-stomach thrills.
There are gigantic waves, frozen clouds, and other dangers that feel threatening despite looking totally surreal.
The biggest danger the shuttle crew faces, however, is time.
Time isn t just running out — it s compressing and stretching as they travel through space.
The Nolans use relativity to create some original and urgent crises as the shuttle crew figures out how to best spend their shifting time.
Time is a resource, like food or water, Hathaway warns.
The time differential between the crew and those they left behind also gives rise to the movie’s most melancholy scenes.
In this respect it feels less like Space Odyssey and more like Homer’s Odyssey, with McConaughey getting detained and delayed as time passes and things go wrong back home.
As in 2001, things get trippy toward the end.
Without revealing too much, I can say that after a series of mostly comprehensible events, it swerves into either deeply theoretical physics or sentimental spirituality.
Possibly both.
The shift is jarring, but also visually interesting enough that I mostly went with it.
There’s always the question with Nolan of what it all means.
His movies tempt you to demand a thesis, partly because his characters always seem to be grasping for one.
They talk almost aphoristically about the human condition, ghosts, time, evil, love, and other heavy but abstract things, and they quote Dylan Thomas a few too many times.
Fortunately, McConaughey brings some wry levity to the role, as does the robot TARS, a toppling metal block with adjustable honesty and humor settings, voiced by Bill Irwin.
Ultimately I took the grander bits of dialogue as thematic signposts, telling you to keep your head at the level of death and humanity and time but not meaning much in themselves.
Which is fine.
The movie is most powerful when it’s at its least abstract — when it’s working through the messy decisions and sacrifices that actual interstellar travel would entail, finding dramatic potential in the laws of physics.
Interstellar is sometimes confusing, melodramatic, and self-serious, but Nolan managed to make a space epic on a human scale.
Interstellar opens November 5th.

Interstellar: The New 2001?
The first batch of reviews for Christopher Nolan s hotly anticipated fall blockbuster are here, and they say the film has Kubrick-level ambition—and needs to be seen in IMAX.
Christopher Nolan s Interstellar is the last big blockbuster of the year.
Or at least  it s the last big blockbuster with the likelihood of uniting critical praise with popular fervor, absent some of the cultural crutches  superheroes; YA  that have bolstered most popcorn flicks these last few years.
It helps that the last time a film did that, it was Nolan s own Inception.
Interstellar screened for select critics last week, and those early reviews were unleashed from under the studio s review embargo this morning.
It s fascinating watching the critical consensus of a movie form right before your eyes.
So far, the notices tend to be generally positive, though not rabidly so.
Many critics seized on the sheer size and scope of Nolan s film, for understandable reasons.
Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway travel to deepest space in order to find a new home since poor Earth is dying.
Even among those who didn t think the movie ultimately succeeded, the breadth of Nolan s effort couldn t help but get applauded.
The best the film can hope for is that it will remind young viewers that there is something else besides this planet, and there is so much of this universe that we don t remotely understand, and if there s any hope for us, it is by looking up.
Nolan s fervent belief in that message alone makes this something worth seeing, and if it can inspire a new generation of dreamers, then even better.
This is a film that takes genuine risks, sometimes succumbs to its own self-indulgence - it’s perilously close to three hours long - but strives unceasingly to put on one hell of a show.
Interstellar aspires to the same cross-cut crescendo that made the last hour of Inception so momentous, but it doesn’t have the ingredients required to reproduce that feeling.
Interstellar, for all its faults, is filled with sequences, moments and concepts worthy of deep, lengthy essays and arguments about morality.
All of which will have to come after release.
Obviously, any sci-fi epic from a respected director is going to draw comparisons to Kubrick s masterpiece.
Interstellar does not disappoint in that regard.
As in 2001,  Grierson s review reads,  Interstellar portrays space as an airless, silent sea that’s both gorgeous and terrifying.
If you were worrying that we might be reaching a saturation or exhaustion points with Matthew McConaughey, these reviews have to come as quite the relief.
He s the star of the show here, with only Jessica Chastain even approaching the amount of ink he s getting.
He’s a hero with all of the honesty and idealism of our the sanitized figures in elementary school history books.
That may sound like a knock, but it isn t - McConaughey can embody that kind of goodness without coming across as cloying or phony.
The McConaissance continues with a performance that doesn’t require much capital-A acting yet delivers every ounce of truth needed to sell its oddities.
It s only appeared in the latest trailer for the most brief moment, but the reviews have been all over the android character TARS, voiced by Bill Irwin.
If anyone was wondering whether Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, or Casey Affleck was going to end up as the breakout favorite from the film s supporting cast, it looks like they ve all been upstaged by the new R2D2.
A pair of obelisk-droids known as CASE and TARS, whose resemblance to the black monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey is a long way from unintentional.
Bill Irwin, the actor who gives his voice to TARS – much the more loquacious of the two – operated these machines on set as a hydraulic puppeteer, but they can also perform more acrobatic, CGI-assisted feats of rapid rotation: as surplus military machines, they’re reminders of human conflict from a planet that’s just about given up the fight.
TARS, a prolonged mechanical slab of data-processing and sarcasm, is the movie’s greatest innovation.
He’s ridiculous and inventive, the wry Bill Irwin lending his voice for the automated companion.
TARS instantly joins Wilson from Cast Away as one of film’s great inanimate objects.
The crew also has its own smart-ass robot sidekick, voiced by Bill Irwin.
Presumably, this is Nolan’s cheeky way of tipping his cap to metallic forerunners like the ones in Lost In Space and Star Wars, but it’s not clever or resonant enough to leave much of an impression.
The other big win for nerds is TARS, the movie s awesome robots.
Prepare to see TARS and his buddy CASE listed in all future  best movie robots ever  lists.
They take up space like Forbidden Planet s Robbie, are  in the system  like 2001: A Space Odyssey s HAL, and they look like nothing you ve ever seen.
At rest, they are gray-ish chrome slabs.
They walk like Jacob s Ladder toys.
But when the other-worldly excrement hits the fan  and there s one humdinger of an action set-piece , they can contort themselves into useful geometric shapes and crack jokes at the same time.

Interstellar has the weight of extraordinary expectations as Christopher Nolan’s first directorial outing since The Dark Knight Rises and Matthew McConaughey’s initial appearance following the actor’s Academy Award win for Dallas Buyers Club - the cherry on top of the past two years’ “McConaughnaissance”.
There is a sense that filmgoers are looking for the space adventure to be nothing less than transcendent, exhalent, the second coming…calorie-less salted caramel ice-cream and so on.
When a creator is deemed a visionary and or a master of their craft in their lifetime, the viewer can become either more critical or more forgiving.
It feels as though that very human tendency may play into the initial response to this film.
Interstellar has the potential to sweep the audience along in an imaginative and entertaining space fable; to spin an emotional web that will leave some enraptured.
Others may take umbrage with the film’s problematic logical through-line and narrative disconnect.
I find myself drifting between these two perspectives.
Interstellar has been shrouded in secrecy and it’s our intention to honor the creators’ wish that audiences maintain as blank a slate as possible; which makes the reviewing process tricky, as we’ll have to hold the majority of examples and illustrations of the points for post-release.
For now, all we’ll say about the plot is what you can see for yourself in the trailers: Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a man facing an extinction-level crisis who must journey to the far reaches of space in an attempt to save both his own family and humanity at large.
At its core, Interstellar is a quintessentially Christopher Nolan film.
It’s gorgeous.
There can be no doubt that Nolan is in many ways a technical genius with an admirable emphasis on practical effects, as well as an ability to deliver stunning examples of what utilizing those tools can mean for an audience.
There is a tangible, visceral sense to the created universe that is thrilling.
Interstellar has been very consciously designed as an in-theatre event.
In fact, viewers will in fact rob themselves of a crucial piece of the film’s appeal if they choose to experience it for the first time on another format.
When it comes to aesthetics, Nolan truly is a visionary.
The Earth as depicted is as fascinating and meticulously crafted as the planets the film takes us to.
In addition to superb world creation, there are some heady notions of time that the film is playing with, which are mostly based on scientific theory.
It’ll be fairly easy to pull the tread that unravels the science, but if you give yourself over to suspension of disbelief, then Interstellar has the potential to propel you on an engaging and emotionally resonant path; replete with moments that will leave the viewer breathless.
However, some may be forced to disembark during what is - in many ways - a clunky final act.
Interstellar’s story is peppered with logical breaks, but they are for the most part pardonable.
One can fill in the gaps and reason out the narrative holes, if they so choose.
An effort is made to bring us along and ensure that those of us who do not have PHDs in physics can buy into the circumstances as - at least to some degree - plausible.
However, the climax is where the film seems to make a conscious decision to entirely divorce itself of its own logic; therein lays the true issue.
It’s not so much that the film stretches our understanding of space and time, but rather that it introduces its own set of parameters, only to then break or at the very least muddle them.
The audience is left with not so much grand philosophical questions, but with head-scratching queries about how 1 plus 2 ended up equaling C.
In addition, the human behavior  - such as the characters’ decisions, conclusions, and reactions to events - often defy logic.
One small example is that Cooper’s daughter Murph has a response to her father’s choice that becomes entirely befuddling at a certain point.
We wont go into details here, other than to say that while the initial behavior makes sense, further along in the story she has enough information to respond in a different and far more mature manner.
Again, we can’t go into further elaboration, here, but that’s just one relatively minor illustration of what become intermittent story and character issues.
Nolan is a painstaking taskmaster in so many respects, so the areas where he is not are often thrown into sharp relief.
On the technical side, the sound mix is problematic in that key moments of dialogue are muffled.
The finale leaves the viewer wondering if the creators fell back on a Deus Ex Machina because they didn’t have a workable out or if they simply believed that we, the audience, wouldn’t notice.
It’s certainly possible that viewers will take note, but ultimately won’t care.
Those hooked into the emotional trajectory of the tale may breeze past the mental gymnastics others must undertake in order to make the conclusion work.
Having said that, as mentioned, another question arises when thinking about this film: Is analysis sharper because this is Nolan endeavor?
Or is far more excused for the same reason?
The scope and scale of the undertaking – both cinematically and in terms of the story - cannot be denied and is, frankly, astounding.
Nolan also demonstrates his directorial acumen in the casting.
Each role is perfectly suited to the actor, even in the instances where he’s made surprising choices.
The performances are exemplary - as one would expect with this cast - with the characters’ fear and sense of awe palpably felt.
There’s a wonderful surprise appearance from a well-known actor that is just gloriously bonkers.
It drives certain themes home relentlessly.
So what, though?
It’s also bananas in the grandest possible sense.
In addition, this introduction hits on one of the film’s more understated ideas: The human drive for – not just survival – but legacy; significance beyond the grave.
One thing that may surprise audiences is that Interstellar is also often quite funny.
Nolan delivers much of what we’ve come to expect from him as a filmmaker here and also stretches a bit.
One of Christopher Nolan’s greatest gifts as a filmmaker is that he is able to reach a mass audience while playing with big ideas, though he more dances around them than delves in, here.
Openly borrowing from 2001, Close Encounters, and other films of that era, Interstellar has a hook that will be easy for both Hollywood and moviegoers alike to get behind.
It’s a story about one family in the midst of an intergalactic drama.
The themes are presented and touched on rather than fully explored, but they are nonetheless present throughout.
It touches on dilemmas we each face: our place in the world, in history, how to reconcile the time we want to spend with out family vs.
It places those concerns within the framework of a future where nothing less than the continuation of the human race is at stake.
Yet, it is the simple story of a father’s love for his daughter and hers for him that drives the film.
Ultimately, Interstellar is an entertaining, if wonky, science fiction yarn that is as visually spectacular as an audience would hope for, expect, and demand of Nolan.
Interstellar is an imperfect film, but like its central characters, aims about as high as one can.
The ambition, execution, and craftsmanship are all to be admired.
As the filmmaker intended, this is an experience that one can only truly have in the theatre itself and it is one worth having.
Though, as mentioned, Interstellar also has the potential to become a highly divisive film.
Ultimately, the viewers takeaway will likely come down to their emotional response.

Visual aesthetic.

To paraphrase Christopher Nolan ‘s “The Dark Knight,” we don t get the prestige filmmakers we need, we get the ones we deserve.
And one of the ones we seemingly deserve is Nolan himself, a filmmaker with a keen visual sense but also one who undercuts the big, challenging ideas of his movies with unnecessarily tidy resolutions.
In that respect, “Interstellar” may represent an apotheosis of sorts, as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director.
On the plus side, there s a stunning portrayal of how far-reaching space travel might work, a glimpse at an apocalyptic near-future that s both brilliantly written  no year is mentioned, and we re left to glean together important bits of information that zip by in conversation  and designed  the clothes, the cars, and the tech are almost entirely late-20th century , and a vision of robots like nothing I ve ever seen in a movie.
Weighing against that, without getting into spoilers, is a third act of staggering wrongheadedness, along with female characters whose intellect takes a backseat to their exploding emotionalism and rage.
Nolan is, presumably, among a handful of filmmakers who gets to do whatever he wants with minimal studio intrusion, but the resolution of “Interstellar” feels so inorganic that you d swear it was concocted by a Glendale focus group.
That ending feels like such a betrayal because so much of what comes before it manages to be truly stunning, particularly in the 70mm IMAX version, thanks to the art department, the visual effects team, and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema  “Her” .
We open with interviews with elderly Midwesterners remembering crop failure and wind storms, and they would appear to be talking about the Dust Bowl of the 1930s until we see a table being set, where someone dusts off a plate, a glass — and a laptop computer.
In this retro-future, we meet Cooper   Matthew McConaughey  , one of the last pilots to work at NASA before the agency was dissolved, since the lack of food on Earth took priority over reaching the stars.
The widowed Coop runs a family farm with his father-in-law Donald  John Lithgow , son Tom  Timothée Chalamet, “Men, Women and Children” , and daughter Murph  Mackenzie Foy, “The Conjuring” .
The latter is convinced that there are ghosts in her room, knocking objects off shelves and sending her messages via Morse code.
Coop is skeptical until he realizes that lines of dust left on her floor after a windstorm are actually binary code, giving the coordinates to what turns out to be the very last NASA base, where Coop s old mentor Professor Brand   Michael Caine   is overseeing a launch to track down three previous missions that were intended to find a new home for the human race.
Coop must leave behind his family, including a very upset Murph, for the mission, accompanied by Brand s daughter   Anne Hathaway  , two other astronauts, and the sarcastic and boxy  but surprisingly versatile  android TARS  voiced by Bill Irwin .
All the setup is fascinating, as is the space travel, particularly when they journey to planets near a black hole, meaning that for every hour that the landing party spends on the surface, seven years will elapse for the crew member orbiting in the spacecraft.
Cliffhanger sequences involving slow, giant tidal waves and docking with an out-of-control ship demonstrate the director s  and editor Lee Smith s  proficiency.
For much of the film, Nolan  who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan  seems to be unafraid to allow this big-budget extravaganza to tell a story that s about pain and loss and melancholy and sacrifice.
Until it s not that anymore, and “Interstellar” becomes thuddingly prosaic.
Worse, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain  as adult Murphy  both get saddled playing brilliant women who are nonetheless ruled by their, you know, lady feelings, before ultimately capitulating to the men around them, even though the men aren t that stable themselves.
A movie about traveling to the ends of the universe only to find daddy issues?
Interstellar” is a film that isn t afraid to brush up against the edges of infinity; it s just too bad it has no idea how to navigate the voyage back.
Matthew McConaughey stars in this tale of journeying the cosmos, and the science adds up -- but that s not the only virtue of Nolan s impressive big scale accomplishment.
Warner Bros.
Christopher Nolan s movies are usually cold and clever in equal doses, but  Interstellar  shakes up that pattern: A genuinely moving spectacle about the perils of discovery and survival, Nolan s science fiction odyssey applies the same degree of intellect to its borderline corny plot as it does to the physics-heavy backdrop.
The result is a two-pronged blockbuster comprised of smarts and sentimentalism like nothing else out there — not perfect, but expertly crafted and wholly satisfying unlike so many movies made a similar scale today.
Despite narrative details that might require a science degree for full comprehension, the actual premise of  Interstellar  is relatively straightforward: In a near future where Earth s ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet s farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind.
It s during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper  Matthew McConaughey  finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist  Michael Caine, sage-like and sleepy-eyed, per usual  to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole—possibly put there by some mysterious form of life—to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await.
NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him.
Among them, the professor s feisty daughter Brand  Anne Hathaway  continually challenges Cooper s confidence, while a low key physicist  David Gyasi  helps explain each new event.
Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS  voiced by Bill Irwin —basically a giant, talking iPad with legs—marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan s oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion s humor setting.
There s no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they ve been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.
Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home.
Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph  Jessica Chastain  grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance.
These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it s their underlying simplicity that give the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.
Of course, this being a Christopher Nolan movie, it s never really that simple.
Ever since his non-linear sophomore effort  Memento,  Nolan has excelled at a labyrinthine approach to filmmaking in which seemingly every narrative ingredient forms one piece of a tantalizing puzzle.
While his three Batman movies obscured that talent,  Interstellar  allows it to shine where it belongs — in a narrative practically designed for tricky logic.
Even as the story barrels ahead into extrasolar environments made of ice, giant waves, the pratfalls of wormholes and gravitational singularities,  Interstellar  bolsters its plot to genuine character motivation and the continuing impression that everything adds up to…something.
And it does.
Co-written with his brother Jonathan and consultation from theoretical physicist Kip Thorne,  Interstellar  eventually finds Cooper and his colleagues in a distant solar system on the brink of a black hole, which means that time gets funky: Visiting one planet, they lose decades of Earth time over the course of a disastrous three-hour trip — which means that, once back on the ship, Cooper must get caught up on years of messages from his family back home.
Cross-cutting between deep space and increasingly dire events on Earth, Nolan embraces a strategy akin to  Inception,  in which one layer of events regularly comments on the other to absorbing effect.
The difference is that while the structure of  Inception  spoke to the layers of consciousness at the center of its plot, it serves a more affecting purpose.
While Murph and her brother Tom  Casey Affleck  struggle to make peace with their father s absence over the course of decades, Cooper experiences a single, challenging operation in much less time, never quite certain if anything productive will come of it.
The result is a movie at once dense with information and rich with feeling, a rare combo in the blockbuster arena that merges its technical achievements with a tenderness.
Aided by Hans Zimmer s energizing score — a far more colorful effort than the intentionally abrasive ones found in earlier Nolan collaborations— Interstellar  is Nolan s most well-rounded movie to date.
Its three-hour running time never drags.
After some 45 minutes of exposition, the journey through the wormhole doesn t disappoint, and there s much more to come: When Matt Damon surfaces around the two-hour mark as another interplanetary explorer with information that takes the plot in further unexpected directions, there are numerous twists just around the corner.
But their appeal owes less to the surprise factor than the director s nimble ability to fit them in with the movie s galvanizing themes of human survival against the threat of extinction.
Though its sweeping vision of the cosmos invites comparisons to  2001: A Space Odyssey,  the legacy of Stanley Kubrick s mind-bending achievement remains secure.
Despite its epic scope,  Interstellar  delivers a traditional payoff.
Considering its basic set of events, one could easily envision a more straightforward version of the movie guided to fruition by the likes of Steven Spielberg—or Robert Zemeckis, whose  Contact  is the blatant antecedent of the soul-searching hard science combo on display here.
However, the Nolans have never shown the same mastery of characters that they have for situations.
Much of the blunt dialogue strains from simple melodrama  including a prolonged monologue about love  and incredulous exclamations about outrageous plot that might sound more at home on an episode of  Star Trek.  In one outrageous moment, the physicist uses a pen and paper to explain the dynamics of a wormhole to Cooper moments before he flies them into it — as if the briefing session never happened once in the two years it took for them to get there.
For a movie with such a spectacular plot,  Interstellar  strains from such elementary moments  look out for the hints of a romantic subplot that never goes anywhere, maybe because the filmmakers just lost interest after a while .
Outside of those virtues,  Interstellar  still delivers in purely visceral terms, with Nolan s attention to scale always in play.
While staging action has never been his strong suit, here the director crafts a number of extraordinarily thrilling sequences in which otherworldly ingredients take on palpable menace: His renderings of giant interplanetary waves and frozen clouds create a real sense of being lost in ominous environments beyond the realm of expectations.
Cinematographer Hoyt Van Hoytema and effects company Double Negative imbue these scenes with a rich, expansive quality that speaks to the range of space being covered.
The scenes in space never muster the same level of sheer excitement found in last year s  Gravity,  but when objects explode without sound or spin rapidly out of control, it s clear that Nolan s working hard to render events as they might actually happen.
The  wow  factor comes equipped with brains.
Still,  Interstellar  is held together by McConaughey s credible turn, which has more in common with his subdued role on  True Detective  than his usual snarky routine.
Hathaway s strong-willed character lacks the same dimensionality, but she does her best with the material.
However, it s Chastain who really delivers, as a woman at once furious with her father and inexplicably drawn to help him from across the universe.
Instead,  Interstellar  makes its far-reaching concept utterly believable, right down to an outrageous climax that stretches across time and space with bursts of psychedelic imagery that still winds up making sense.
In its final scenes,  Interstellar  struggles to bring every piece in play to a tidy conclusion, but it s comforting to watch Nolan give it a shot.
Warner Bros.
The timing of  Interstellar  caps a great period of science fiction cinema.
The past 12 months have seen the release of not only  Gravity  but also the hard science travelogue  The Europa Report   which in retrospect plays like  Interstellar -lite  as well as the multidimensional dinner party comedy  Coherence,  which also uses real physics in the service of outrageous entertainment.
It s a movie engineered to advertise its genre s innate appeal.
That Nolan can do so much with such a grand canvas and studio money shows the extent to which he has managed to carve out a niche in the industry.
No matter its shortcomings, the movie achieves an impressive balancing act.
It turns the mysteries of the universe into a cinematic playground, but for every profound or visually arresting moment, it also encourages you to to think.
November 5.
We the Economy: Supply and Dance, Man!
Why is the law of supply and demand so powerful?
In this whimsical tale, our friendly narrator guides bored students Jonathan and Kristin through a microeconomic musical extravaganza.
Director: Christopher Nolan.
Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway,    Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Topher Grace, Michael Caine, Wes Bentley,    John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon.
Christopher Nolan is a merchant of awe, which is not to say he’s always    selling it at the right price, or that customer satisfaction is guaranteed    100 per cent of the time.
Even by his standards, Interstellar is a wild leap of faith: an epic of science fiction which puts equal stress    on both words.
The scientific basis of the movie, by a whisker Nolan’s longest ever and    certainly his most all-embracing, is challengingly dense, intricately    explained, and remarkably codswallop-free.
But what pulls you in is its    hugely confident architecture as a piece of storytelling – its brave    fictitiousness.
Nolan comes very close here, one might almost say    agonisingly close, to forging his masterpiece.
In a film that’s just as fond of total silence as hair-raising symphonic blasts, the    plot needs to be a whispered incantation: nothing should be given away of    what actually occurs after the hour mark, once the movie has abandoned our    own galaxy outright, in search of habitable conditions in another one.
It’s    here, suffice it to say, that the film’s ambitions flower and gather, and    sequences of exhilarating beauty, then cuticle-shredding tension, and    finally dizzying conceptual boldness bring its themes crashing together.
But the building blocks are all there in a shrewd, patient, determinedly    earthbound opening third, which is Nolan at his most robustly    straightforward.
Earth has no future in this film, which is why it looks stuck in the past.
The    dawn of a new, highly secret space race arrives against a hardscrabble    backdrop of mythic Americana.
We have all – including the former NASA    engineer-pilot Cooper  Matthew McConaughey  – become farmers out of    desperation, as every crop but corn fails, plagued by the dust storms that    scourge the planet daily.
The widowed Cooper is a man out of time: “You were    either born 40 years too late or 40 years too early,” says his father-in-law     John Lithgow  as they sit on the porch, contemplating their failing fields    and the uncertain promise of the stars.
Cooper is the one chosen to pilot us out of this slow-grind apocalypse, as the    head of a reconnaissance mission that counts as the definition of    experimental: it involves diving into a wormhole that was mysteriously    placed within human reach two generations earlier.
His companions on this    expedition are introduced in the various forms of Anne Hathaway, Wes    Bentley, David Gyasi and a pair of obelisk-droids known as CASE and TARS,    whose resemblance to the black monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey is a long    way from unintentional.
Bill Irwin, the actor who gives his voice to TARS – much the more loquacious of the two – operated these machines on set as a    hydraulic puppeteer, but they can also perform more acrobatic, CGI-assisted    feats of rapid rotation: as surplus military machines, they’re reminders of    human conflict from a planet that’s just about given up the fight.
What shape is our future to take?
One by one, these pioneers investigate and    exhaust the possible options, and the movie is revealed as a race against    time.
Hours on one candidate planet are years, or whole decades, on the one    we need to abandon.
Matt Damon, an actor who appears to have aged 20 years    in about five, embodies this paradox with particular poignancy when he    eventually shows up.
Meanwhile, Cooper’s children age, in a heartbeat, into    Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck, contemporaries of the very good    McConaughey, whose abandonment across half a lifetime gives them, and him,    richly emotional notes to play.
Unlike Inception, whose puzzle-box games with time felt like a bedazzling    gimmick, Interstellar mines the same ideas with a much more deep-digging    intelligence, as the primary condition behind everything we know of the    universe.
I’m afraid of time”, admits Michael Caine’s character, a NASA    physicist for whom this ticking clock is humanity’s oldest and worst enemy.
Nolan has built himself a huge house here, stepping from room to room to talk    about human loneliness, love, the survival instinct, quantum physics,    relativity – all the big questions, in one blockbuster package.
If the    philosophy ever has a whiff of cod, it’s very good cod.
Working with a remarkable new cinematographer, Her’s Hoyte Van Hoytema, Nolan    conjures the most eerily beautiful vistas he’s ever put on screen, whether    it’s the bright speck of a capsule floating past the rings of Saturn, or the    frozen wastes of a cloud-cuckoo-land planet which may or may not save us.
For oomph, drama and all-important awe, meanwhile, the director is falling    back heavily on the gifts of a long-time collaborator, Hans Zimmer.
The film    alternates the actual total hush of dead space – take that, Gravity – with    the vast sounds of a composer set loose on his grandest ever assignment.
But    it relies less on Straussian majesty à la 2001 than something rather more    pointed: the hypnotic, metronomically surging, and oddly sacred homage    Zimmer gives us to Koyaanisqatsi, by Philip Glass.
There, time-lapse    photography illustrated our planet’s accelerating doom.
What Nolan’s doing    is slowing things down, showing the decades as they slip ineffably through    our fingers, and hoping against hope for a way out.
Early in Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” NASA-pilot-turned-farmer Coop  Matthew McConaughey  has to make a choice: Take part in a secret, last-ditch, one-way space launch that might find humanity a home other than the dying, desolate, used-up Earth … or stay and care for his son and daughter, still in their childhood.
His father-in-law  John Lithgow  growls, with stern judgment, that Coop shouldn’t make promises he can’t keep.
It’s a piece of advice that seems to have gone unheard by the makers of “Interstellar,” even as they wrote it.
Promising outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick s “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Interstellar” instead plays like a confused mix of daringly unique space-travel footage like you’ve never seen and droningly familiar emotional and plot beats that you’ve seen all too many times before.
Set in a near-future—after the food riots, but there are still product placements for Dodge trucks and Carhartt clothing—“Interstellar” begins as Coop’s daughter Murph  Mackenzie Foy  is convinced she has a ghost in her room, one that moves objects and knocks down knick-knacks.
Whatever it is behind the bumps and falls, it also makes the dust blown into the room from one of the regular raging windstorms that scour the landscape fall to the floor in deliberate places and varying densities, defying physics to spell out a binary-number code that signifies a set of coordinates.
Driving to the coordinates, Coop finds a secret NASA base, where his mentor Dr.
Brand  Michael Caine  is startled to see his old protégé.
Bates heads the team designed to launch a ship to find out what happened to the last group of 11 astronauts sent out into space on 11 different missions to find a new home for mankind … all of whom are no longer broadcasting back to Earth.
Helping NASA s efforts is a gravitational anomaly that was not just recently found, but indeed recently created near Saturn, one that functions as a wormhole where ships can leap across near-infinite distances as easily as two dots on the other side of a piece of paper can touch when folded.
It was left there, we’re informed, by super-powerful 5th-dimensional entities who apparently have an interest in humanity.
All I could think when this plot point was explained was how that was really nice of the omnipotent 5th-dimensional entities, considering we didn’t get them anything.
Coop s crew includes Dr.
Brand s scientist daughter  Anne Hathaway , a sarcastic robot  voiced by Bill Irwin , and a few other human crewmembers who might as well be wearing red “Star Trek” jumpers.
As Coop and his team travel closer and closer to the speed of light, time slows down for them.
Back on the ever-worsening Earth, the now-grown Murph  Jessica Chastain  is now working for the NASA project herself, brokenhearted over what she thinks is her father’s death, but still soldiering on.
Nolan is a master technician, and the space flight scenes in this are stunning, whether in the still beauty of a slow pass by Saturn’s rings or the swift, silent terror of disaster destroying a spaceship in the void between the stars.
While the great complaint about Nolan is that he’s too cold, too clinical, too unemotional, he’s over-corrected here to such a degree than instead of drifting a little from one side to the next, he plows, swiftly, and disastrously, into a ditch of his own making—or, rather, of his and co-writer Jonathan Nolan’s making.
A film where any character says “maybe love … transcends time and space …” is not exactly an exciting prospect for a moviegoer interested in characters, ideas, and plot more than, or even as much, as they are in IMAX-sized visual wonder and all of the feels.
The film’s score, by Hans Zimmer, is all bombast and blunders, and the technical marvels cannot make up for the writing.
When the silent monolith from  2001  shoved poor Dave Bowman up the evolutionary ladder against his will, the finale moved to a higher plane of cosmic strangeness.
When the advanced beings pulling the strings in “Interstellar” finally intervene directly in Coop’s life and times, it feels less like cosmic strangeness than it does convenient sentimentality.
There are other mis-steps, as well, both individual mistakes that stand out as they happen and larger errors in judgment that suffuse the whole piece.
A familiar face shows up as a bit of stunt casting, and it’s a decision that pops the audience utterly out of the movie, delighted by a name-brand actor when they should be being pulled into the movie.
A framing device from the very beginning of the film tips the hand of the rest of the movie.
The super-powered entities are both all-powerful enough to make time and space dance but still apparently need McConaughey to act on their behalf as they, for reasons only explainable by lazy writing, cannot.
And it s not just that the film s climax requires the sudden appearance of an all-powerful object that can perhaps set the universe right and save the day in a example of deus ex machina, it s that the script makes the lead character himself the all-powerful object that can perhaps set the universe right in the first ever example of deus ex McConaughey.
After all the jaw-dropping cinematography and carefully-buffed CGI, in fact,  Interstellar  winds up fitting into a fairly narrow and deeply tired sub-genre alongside films like  Frequency,   Contact,  and even  Field of Dreams : Dad Issues from Dimension X.
It s impossible to not admire the technical achievements of  Interstellar,  but as Michael Bay and so much more modern moviegoing has proved, rapturous visuals can t make up for a ruptured script.

Christopher Nolan s space epic  Interstellar  is still a month away from theaters, but the final trailer is out now and to say it is amazing is an understatement of, well, interstellar proportions.
In   Interstellar ,  Earth has run out of food, and a team of astronauts — including Matthew McConaughey as engineer-pilot  Cooper  — has to leave the planet to hunt for an alien world that humans could call home.
The new two-and-a-half-minute clip features more scenes of a dusty, desperate Earth and Cooper with the daughter he has to leave behind for his humanity-saving mission.
There are also gorgeous new shots of imagined alien planets and the spaceship Endurance.
There s even a new view of that weird monolithic walking robot we caught a glimpse of in the last trailer .
In the teaser, we also find out that humans don t have much time to find a new home planet.

Christopher Nolan s $165 million space epic, rockets into wide release Nov.
7, but some critics have already filed their reviews.
The consensus so far?
Most agree the visuals are stunning and that Matthew McConaughey is great as an engineer who ventures to another galaxy to research potential inhabitable worlds.
But the first reactions haven t been as favorable toward the film s emotional heft and the pacing of its third act.
1.
Interstellar  so bulges with ideas, ambitions, theories, melodrama, technical wizardry, wondrous imagery and core emotions that it was almost inevitable that some of it would stick while other stuff would fall to the floor.
2.
As with the twisty chronologies and unreliable narrators of his earlier films, Nolan trusts in the audience’s ability to get the gist and follow along, even if it doesn’t glean every last nuance on a first viewing.
3.
Interstellar’ is about saving humanity, despite humanity.
It disguises itself in science, but ‘Interstellar’ isn’t really about science.
4.
While the film builds intrigue and tension in terms of establishing the stakes of the outer-space exploration as well as the perilous science behind it, the picture rushes into space only to slow to a relative crawl once it gets there.
There are a few dazzling images and at least one solid action sequence late in the game, and it is always fun to see the real-world implications of somewhat abstract scientific theory.
5.
All the setup is fascinating, as is the space travel, particularly when they journey to planets near a black hole, meaning that for every hour that the landing party spends on the surface, seven years will elapse for the crew member orbiting in the spacecraft.
Cliifhanger sequences involving slow, giant tidal waves and docking with an out-of-control ship demonstrate the director s  and editor Lee Smith s  proficiency.
For much of the film, Nolan  who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan  seems to be unafraid to allow this big-budget extravaganza to tell a story that s about pain and loss and melancholy and sacrifice.
6.
Often when we talk about cinema being a ‘ride’, we’re hinting at a lack of substance, an absence of ideas, an opportunity to switch off.
Not so here.
Interstellar’ is, in large part, a spectacle.
But it also asks you to think hard, look hard and urges you to return for more.
Why only ask for the stars when you can have moons, distant planets, extra dimensions, lectures on psychics and a sobering shot of terror?
7.
Interstellar,  a near three-hour whopper of a picture, powers through its plot holes and barrels through the corn.
It’s a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humor.
It wants to awe us into submission, to concede our insignificance in the face of such grand-scale art.
It achieves that with ease.
8.
Interstellar  makes its far-reaching concept utterly believable, right down to an outrageous climax that stretches across time and space with bursts of psychedelic imagery that still winds up making sense.
In its final scenes,  Interstellar  struggles to bring every piece in play to a tidy conclusion, but it s comforting to watch Nolan give it a shot.
9.
The space travel stuff is beautiful and realized though largely physical means.
10.
Interstellar  tackles some big ideas along the way.
Some are fascinating -- fifth-dimensional space represented in three dimensions -- and some are cringe-worthy -- love as a universal constant -- but all of the ideas are approached with honesty and intelligence.
That alone makes me like and admire the movie.
I just wish I could love it;  Inception  blew me away the first time through and has remained a film that moves me intellectually, cinematically and even emotionally.
Well, I grew up in the country and didn t wear shirts or shoes.
The pain you feel will never compare to the regret that comes from walking away from love.
And from someone who s felt a lot of both trust me.
I want to be reincarnated as a jaguar.
They re the coolest animals in the world.
I came across one very briefly in the Manú National Park in Peru.
I followed its tracks and got close enough to realize how beautifully self-contained it was.
Jaguars are keen and they re perfectly poised.
I ve had a lot of girlfriends.
Sometimes I m the rebound guy.
Other times, I m the  explore new areas of your sexuality  guy.
But every single time, we have fun.
I have fun, they have fun.
Guys, a woman s purse, all right, it s her secret source of power.
If you can catch eye contact with a mammal, you can buy yourself some time--because as another mammal, you can communicate.
I have dreams about this kind of shit.
I don t want to wrestle any of these things, but I m just saying, that s what I d do if the situation arose where I m just sitting there and I go,  Oh, look there.
That grizzly has got my girl and child.
I love to travel to different countries where there is no electricity or where I don t know the language, there is no hot food, there is no clean water, where all of a sudden you go through withdrawals.
And then you come back home to America and, oh man, that just tastes beautiful and that hot water just feels great, that soft bed feels good.
I ve lived in big houses and a big space gave me too many options.
I had this amazing chair that I loved but I d go months without sitting on it.
I had some nice paintings on the walls but I d hardly ever look at them.
I realized I didn t need those things.
My Airstream trailer is 28  by 7  and it s got everything I need.
My living space is so small that I can sit on the toilet and scramble eggs at the same time.
It s amazing how quickly you shower when you think there might be a python in your room.
I had an eight-foot python in the coconut tree in my backyard and a six-foot python in my shed.
To understand me, you need to understand Texan logic.
If you come from Texas, you re 100 percent American but you ll do things the Texan way.
We re independent.
We ve got our own way of doing things.
You haven t lived until you ve tasted my butt chicken.
You get a can of beer and leave half of the liquid inside it.
Throw a bunch of spices into the can, then stick that in the chicken and stand it up on the grill.

The first round of reviews are now in for Christopher Nolan’s apocalyptic space and time-travel epic Interstellar, and they are decidedly mixed.
Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.
Already by this point — and we have not yet left the Earth’s surface —  Interstellar   which Nolan co-wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator, Jonathan  has hurled a fair amount of theoretical physics at the audience, including discussions of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space.
And, as with the twisty chronologies and unreliable narrators of his earlier films, Nolan trusts in the audience’s ability to get the gist and follow along, even if it doesn’t glean every last nuance on a first viewing.
It’s hard to think of a mainstream Hollywood film that has so successfully translated complex mathematical and scientific ideas to a lay audience  though Shane Carruth’s ingenious 2004 Sundance winner  Primer  — another movie concerned with overcoming the problem of gravity — tried something similar on a micro-budget indie scale , or done so in more vivid, immediate human terms.
Yet there is too much fat outside of the core dilemma, especially as the film reaches an emotional peak at around the halfway mark.
Moreover, many of the characters aren’t terribly engaging despite the fine and dedicated cast.
It’s well-acted by all parties, but too many of the supporting characters don’t resonate beyond scientific talking heads.
Michael Caine gives good exposition as expected, and both Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck are hauntingly good as  no spoilers  desperate survivors of what may be the last generation of humanity.
Anne Hathaway gets but one terrific monologue about quantifying human emotion while the rest of the outer-space NASA folks are relatively dry  that Hathaway is the main female character yet is, slight spoiler, both distracted by would-be love and needs to be rescued costs the film a few points .
This is all a remarkable set-up for what is an undeniably exciting movie.
I can t lie and call it perfect, however.
Some sections drag, and perhaps unavoidably, since Interstellar s length is key to its essence.
We are talking about a film that draws some of its strongest emotions out of time dilation and relativity—through one-way communications, our heroes watch the loved ones left behind age in what, to the space travelers, feels like a blink.
Nolan has built himself a huge house here, stepping from room to room to talk about human loneliness, love, the survival instinct, quantum physics, relativity — all the big questions, in one blockbuster package.
That s not to say the last half-hour of the film will be easy for every audience.
And it s not to say that  getting it  has anything to do with liking it.
I think Nolan makes a misstep here in the story he s telling, and a sizable one, but he does it because of the emotional journey he s setting up, and as a result, it pays off for me.
Until now, Nolan s never made me cry with one of his films, but in this movie, he managed to do it twice, and not just a little bit.
There s a sequence about halfway into the movie that flattened me.
It s just brutally sad and honest and simple.
And, yeah, when the film finally starts to wrap up, there s a line delivered by a fairly big-name cameo that crushed me all over again.
It feels like for Nolan, making that connect was more important here than worrying about a spinning top or making you wonder about the bodies in the display cases or, frankly, servicing the sequel needs of Warner Bros.
Here, the punctuation mark feels like it s about human connection, about faith in each other more than faith in the invisible.
That Nolan can do so much with such a grand canvas and studio money shows the extent to which he has managed to carve out a niche in the industry.
Brainy and exciting at the same time,  Interstellar  invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product.
No matter its shortcomings, the movie achieves an impressive balancing act.
McConaughey eventually leaves Foy and Earth behind to scout out a new home for for the human race, but it’s their relationship that grounds the movie.
As action-filled as Nolan’s films are, they can sometimes feel abstract, like symbolic sublimations of some offscreen mental trauma.
So many of his characters get their motivation from some prior loss — the dead wives from Memento and Inception, the dead parents of Batman — that they then work through according to the game-like rules Nolan excels at, whether those rules are imposed by amnesia, consciousness, or a supervillain.
In that respect,  Interstellar  may represent an apotheosis of sorts, as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director.
On the plus side, there s a stunning portrayal of how far-reaching space travel might work, a glimpse at an apocalyptic near-future that s both brilliantly written  no year is mentioned, and we re left to glean together important bits of information that zip by in conversation  and designed  the clothes, the cars, and the tech are almost entirely late-20th century , and a vision of robots like nothing I ve ever seen in a movie.
Weighing against that, without getting into spoilers, is a third act of staggering wrongheadedness, along with female characters whose intellect takes a back seat to their exploding emotionalism and rage.
Co-written by Nolan  with his brother, Jonathan  and inspired by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne’s work on traversable wormholes, Interstellar only really gets going once it’s up in the air.
A tribute – occasionally a remake – of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, it saves its beauty for the cosmos and its humanity for machines.
The actors – even those of the calibre of McConaughey and Hathaway - are script-delivering modules, there to output exposition and process emotional data.
The best lines, those that seem truly spontaneous and responsive, go to TARS, the crew’s AI assistant.
And this brings us to ‘Interstellar,’ a movie filled with so much scientific jargon that it does a pretty good job hiding how absurd some of the movie can be.
And that’s the thing: the scientific jargon is fascinating.
Sure, Nolan plays around a lot with gravity’s effect on space and time, but, like ‘Inception,’ everything is explained.
For all its adventurous and far-seeing aspects, Interstellar remains rather too rooted in Earthly emotions and scientific reality to truly soar and venture into the unknown, the truly dangerous.
You have no idea what I m talking about, I m sure.
But don t worry, you will.
Because I think everyone who s interested enough to have gotten this far in the review needs to see it, if only to decide what parts of Nolan s vision they disagree with, and to appreciate the magnitude of that vision regardless.
It was mostly shot in IMAX, and there are certainly more than a few scenes that are worth seeing in that large format as I did, but I wouldn t say it s absolutely necessary to do so.

Very impressive Extremely impressive simulation, even though the Kepler laws are not quite respected ;P 5 stars.
Great fun Even if you don t understand harder science ideas, it s a great game and probably a good way to teach physics to children.
Surprisingly fun!
Becomes repetitive quite quickly, but worth playing for the initial hype.
Interestingly thought-out concept for a touch-screen space travel game.
I have no what s going on I don t really know what I m supposed to be doing, but flying around solar systems is pretty cool.
Login The login never works.
Can t connect with Facebook to start an account.
Tried email, but it never works.
Tried to reset my email password yea they never sent me a reset.
The game sucks if you have to restart every time you play it.
This game is a fail.
Very challenging game Trying to slingshot at the right speed to orbit can be challenging, but for a free game without annoying ads I have to give it 5 stars.
Definitely a good way to kill time while trying to master.
It has a few quirks, but considering the price, they re tolerable for me.
Doesnt even deserve a rating First time i open the app it loads halfway and then it opens up the alarm app.
On the samsung, is this supposed to happen?
It happens everytime rating wont change unless its fixed.
Amazing!
I really liked every aspect of the game  despite the annoying moons  but one bug tgat is giving me troubles was activating my account.
Pretty good The physics aren t really perfectly accurate, but it s still a fun game, and is definitely a the best movie tie-in I ve played.
Startup issue improved but not fixed Still doesn t work.
I got up to 50% on the startup screen and it quit out once again.
Desperate to play this.
Doesn t work anymore Since last 3 updates game just loads in galaxy map.
Great until the  no connection  startup glitch The so called fix hasn t fixed the problem.
Great game otherwise.
Defs gonna watch the movie Game is awesome.
Very nice concept but repetitive With initial issues solved,itvis a nuce solid software, but it gets very repetitive after the second day.
Hardly Works!
To start, many functions of this game work.
Also, this morning it wouldn t load.
So I had to uninstall it and reinstall it.
After I did this, I tried to log back into my account to restore my data and to my disbelief it didn t.
One of the worst movie tie in games I ve ever seen!
Disappointed.
Orbital challenge The key is to get into orbit by controlling your speed.
Great fun slingshotting your way around the solar systems.
It s like being on board Voyager 2.
WOW!
I can t believe this game is free!
So much to do, and almost no restriction on play time.
Creeping up You fixed the log in but now it says I need internet when its already on, please fix and ill give more stars!
Load fail.
Worked only once.
Now won t load.
I ve just installed it and I can t load to main menu.
It s such a waste for me to installed it to my phone.
Good for a movie game Usually, when movies come out with game apps, I get skeptical.
But this went FAR beyond my expectations.
The graphics are really good, and I love that you play completely within user generation galaxies.
I would suggest a download!
Very awsome game works great love the graphics and game play.
Cant open.
The game always force closes.
WAY overexceded my expectations!
Download it.
You won t be sorry.
Great game but Logging into Facebook isn t working.

Snow, man … Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar.
The moon and the planets are there, likewise new hopes for knowledge and peace.
JFK would doubtless approve of Christopher Nolan’s grand space opera, Interstellar – well, the subject matter, at least.
Strident, overbearing, tangled up in plot-lines and bunged with theory, the director’s first film post-Batman rockets its way to entertainment through Nolan’s dogged force of will.
Earth’s food is running out.
The wheat is blighted, the okra’s out.
Every able body is needed to help grow corn.
Cooper  Matthew McConaughey , an engineering whiz and former flying ace, tends his farm amid worsening dust storms with the help of son, Tom  Timothée Chalamet  and daughter, Murph  Mackenzie Foy .
Tom is happily grounded, but Murph’s like her dad: she sees patterns in chaos, knows there’s something out there that can save humanity.
She’s convinced that a ghost is leaving her messages which point to a new truth all of them need to appreciate.
Her hunch leads them to Lazarus, a covert operation run by what remains of Nasa, where chief scientist Professor Brand  Michael Caine  proposes sending a team, including his own daughter  Anne Hathaway  and Cooper on humanity’s last space flight – a journey through a wormhole to scope out a distant solar system for new planets to call home.
Co-written by Nolan  with his brother, Jonathan  and inspired by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne’s work on traversable wormholes , Interstellar only really gets going once it’s up in the air.
A tribute – occasionally a remake – of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, it saves its beauty for the cosmos and its humanity for the machines.
The actors – even those of the calibre of McConaughey and Hathaway - are script-delivering modules, there to output exposition and process emotional data.
The best lines, those that seem truly spontaneous and responsive, go to TARS, the crew’s AI assistant.
In this world human beings are outdated software, bad code to be over-written.
The fear of the unknown is matched only by the threat of humanity knowing more than is good for us, but this is no Alien.
There’s no sense of day-to-day existence, no capacity for individual quirk.
The soundtrack thunders all over the dialogue.
Michael Caine intones Dylan Thomas’s Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night across scenes of brave men and women in peril.
The solemnity makes the journey hard-going and the film sporadically sways into the absurd, like a M Night Shyamalan film shackled with the responsibility of maintaining its intelligence.
Not every film need address the possibility of human extinction with the gung-ho silliness of Armageddon, but at least that was a space adventure.
This is a science report.
Interstellar looks remarkable.
It’s the best introduction of scientific theory into blockbuster cinema since Nolan’s state-of-consciousness thriller, Inception.
Nolan never patronises his audience, yet – in thrilling at the potential of human endeavour – he often forgets them.
The relationships  even the crucial one between Cooper and Murph, who is abandoned and bitter, back on earth  don’t have enough pull.
The characters got lost in space.
The last of our species wobble on the brink of extinction.
The crew, stranded in a distant solar system with time running out, debate quantum theory and the selfish gene.
Outside the majesty of the galaxy sweeps by, a glorious, timeless distraction.
Interstellar, a near three-hour whopper of a picture, powers through its plot holes and barrels through the corn.
It’s a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour.
It wants to awe us into submission, to concede our insignificance in the face of such grand-scale art.
It achieves that with ease.
Yet on his way to making an epic, Nolan forgot to let us have fun.
Our editors  picks for the day s top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.
The answer is all three.
There have been numerous screenings since, including a couple for the SAG nominating committee on Thursday night at the Chinese and Saturday night at Arc:ight in Sherman Oaks that were followed by Q&As I was pleased to moderate with stars Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain.
The film was junketing this weekend, and there was a big Los Angeles official premiere Sunday night, also at the Chinese.
There will be another in NYC next week in advance of the November 5-6 select IMAX and 70MM film special screenings and its national break on November 7.
Interstellar is a really nice rebound for M Night.
Earth Vs.
Rock Hudson famously walked out of that premiere, blasting the movie as not worthy of Hollywood.
Obviously that wasn’t the case as the Stanley Kubrick classic is regarded almost as a religious experience for its zealots, and I have no doubt that the powerful, moving and thought-provoking Interstellar just might be regarded in that same league decades from now.
What it has that 2001 famously lacked is true human beings.
The actors in it had less emotion than the robot HAL.
Interstellar, on the other hand, is an emotional roller coaster and, for me, ultimately less a head-scratching sci-fi trip than a movie about time, love and human connectiveness.
In other words, it is trying to unlock the mysteries in us and our relationship to one another as much as what’s out there in the great beyond.
That element should play well with the Academy, which never has given a so-called “Science Fiction Film” the Best Picture Oscar  though 2013’s Gravity, to which Interstellar will be compared, came tantalizingly close, winning seven Oscars and Best Director only to lose the big one in the end to 12 Years A Slave .
Reviews so far range from rapturous to mixed  our stablemate Variety puts it in the same breath with The Wizard Of Oz, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, and 2001 , and the early score at Rotten Tomatoes stands at 75% fresh, with just 20 reviews posted so far.
But the big guns at big city newspapers won’t be heard until next week.
Critics and a handful of cranky pundits aside, I can tell you the industry so far seems to be blown away by Interstellar.
I was on the phone last week with Chris Rock, an Oscar voter as well as former Oscar host, interviewing him about his new comedy, Top Five, a smash hit at Toronto that Paramount will release December 5 , right in the heart of awards season.
I wondered what he thought about his own chances for awards, especially in original screenplay.
It’s intriguing, but I saw Interstellar, so …” — meaning what chance could he, or anyone else, possibly have?
At the Science Center party under the imposing Space Shuttle Endeavor, I saw several others expressing the same sentiments.
A top major guild executive was still shaking and told me it was easily the best film he’d seen all year.
One SAG- and Oscar-voting actor surprised me by praising this film over the more actor-centric Birdman, on which he seemed lukewarm at best.
A SAG Nom Comm voter, an older woman, told me she hadn’t experienced another film like it.
To be sure Interstellar offers reigning Best Actor winner McConaughey his richest, most heroic and perhaps most emotional role ever — even more so, believe it or not, than Dallas Buyers Club.
Jonathan Nolan’s original script .
If McConaughey hadn’t won last year, a nomination in this extremely competitive Best Actor race would be a given — he’s barely ever off screen in the film’s near-three-hour running time — but depending on how this all plays out, we could see him there again.
It’s a huge movie-star performance in the best sense.
Jessica Chastain, one of three actresses to play Cooper’s daughter Murph at different ages, has an enormously difficult role, but she nails it and should be in the running again for Best Supporting Actress.
The Best Picture category was made for films of this scope, ambition and achievement.
And it is largely CGI-less, a rare move for epic movies of this scope, which should impress filmmakers.
The major computers used for this film are on screen more than off.
I would be surprised if Oscar voters left their love for this only to technical categories as they did all those years ago with 2001.
After all, though his The Dark Knight famously didn’t make the Best Picture cut in 2008, it was responsible for the shift from five to 10 nominees that the Academy undertook the next year.
And his Inception did get a Picture nod.
I also think the complex original screenplay by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan could be in.
Even Kubrick’s enormously heady script with Arthur C.
Brooks’ The Producers .
Nominations in the below-the-line categories such as Cinematography, Editing, Hans Zimmer’s great score, Sound, Makeup and Production Design are all very possible.
The studio needs to keep the booming sound in check, though, as it appeared to overwhelm some at one early screening.
The Academy has its official screening on Saturday night, and it will be interesting to see reaction there.
The big question is whether the directors branch finally will succumb to the power of Nolan.
Although he has had three DGA nominations  Memento, The Dark Knight, Inception , the much more exclusive — and elusive — Academy directors branch never has nominated him.
This will be a litmus test.
We’ll see.
As the Interstellar rollout continues during the next couple of weeks, more of this story will be told, and its awards prospects will take shape.
This is not a movie that can be dismissed easily.

I got to see an early screening.
Saw a screening of it and it was good.
Still think the Oscar should go to Birdman because of how unique and we’ll shot that film is.
Still, Interstellar was good and a sight to see especially in IMAX.
The movie definitely isn’t Nolan’s best, but it’s hellva lot better than The Dark Knight Rises.
Birdman is definitely a good movie but imo it’s getting too much praise.
Completely agree.
Damnation by faint praise much?
You do realize you’re alone in this view right?
This has the makings of a future classic.
I’m overjoyed about the reaction to the premiere of “Interstellar” and its Oscar possibilities.
The comparison to “2001 A Space Odyssey” is also interesting in that the film was very controversial.
How the general public reacts will be the determining factor on its Oscar possibilities.
I can hardly wait to see this film.
Did you not know that even now you are In an interstellar conveyance !
Respect for the “Earth Vs.
Yes, Pete, this is one of the best films of this year.
But, don’t forget about Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi because they were both pretty good.
Even though, I don’t expect any acting nominations.
Nolan wins for  creating hundreds of good jobs  in Los Angeles, the Ghost Town of film production.
I have health care this year because of Mr.
Nolan.
It was a pleasure working my ass off  making great sets and special effects gizmos for Interstellar.
Best Director – Christopher Nolan….
Interstellar is a really nice rebound for M Night.
Not as good as Sixth Sense but this should get him back… Wait, what… this was Nolan?
Uh oh.

Deep, deep into the 169-minute running time of ‘ Interstellar ’ is a scene in which astronaut pilot Cooper   Matthew McConaughey   must dock a spaceship with another, larger, out of control spinning space ship.
The solution is to spin the smaller ship at the same speed, so that the effect makes it looks like both crafts aren’t spinning at all.
So, by spinning everything out of control, it manipulates the situation into looking normal.
This is also an apt description of the style of ‘Interstellar’ director, Christopher Nolan .
Nolan rose to fame with 2000’s ‘Memento,’ a film that famously shows its scenes in reverse order.
A nice trick that, in the hands of a less capable filmmaker – or, say, an episode of ‘Seinfeld’ – might be perceived as a stunt, but Nolan turned it into a structured plot device.
Everything was thrown so out of whack, that, eventually we, as an audience – just like the spinning space crafts — started spinning with the film, to the point it eventually all seemed normal.
Nolan also directed three superhero films in which not one person has a super power of any kind.
By standing the superhero genre on its head and shaking out all of the excess nonsense, he made – arguably; with a lot of the heavy lifting done by ‘ The Dark Knight ’ alone — the best standalone superhero trilogy ever put to film.
An actor appearing in one of Nolan’s superhero movies won an Oscar.
That is almost a ludicrous statement today – could you imagine anyone from a Marvel movie winning an Oscar — but, at the time, in Nolan’s world, it all seemed normal.
Interstellar’ will most often be compared to Nolan’s 2010 film, ‘Inception’ — a movie that takes the whole idea of dreams and dreams within dreams to create a world that’s so foreign, yet based in a heightened scientific reality.
Soon after seeing ‘Inception,’ I read about how to have lucid dreams.
Inception’ got a little too much credit in the “it will blow your mind” department.
Inception’ is not a confusing movie – characters literally explain every single little thing that’s happening along the way – yet it got the reputation of being incredibly smart.
Inception’ certainly isn’t dumb, but it’s not hard to follow.
What it does deserve credit for is making all of this seem plausible to the point that, after, people like me were trying to read up on how to have lucid dreams.
One of Nolan’s greatest gifts as a filmmaker is taking the absurd and syncing that absurdity with the viewer, where now we are all spinning at the same speed and we feel what we are watching is normal and real.
And this brings us to ‘Interstellar,’ a movie filled with so much scientific jargon that it does a pretty good job hiding how absurd some of the movie can be.
And that’s the thing: the scientific jargon is fascinating.
Sure, Nolan plays around a lot with gravity’s effect on space and time, but, like ‘Inception,’ everything is explained.
Interstellar’ begins by introducing us to former pilot, now farmer, Cooper  McConaughey .
The setting is in the future, yet it’s a future where everything still seems somewhat familiar.
Cooper is now a farmer because, well, pretty much everyone who is still alive is a farmer – this is an Earth going through a devastating food crisis.
Led by mysterious forces, Cooper and his daughter, Murph  Mackenzie Foy , find a hidden NASA base.
Led by scientists Dr.
Brand  Michael Caine  and his daughter, Amelia   Anne Hathaway  , they are trying to find a way for humanity to leave our dying planet.
And, as it turns out, Cooper would be a perfect pilot for the next  they’ve had others  expedition  through a wormhole near Saturn  to try and find a hospitable replacement planet in another galaxy — leaving his son and daughter behind.
Watching on one of the best IMAX theaters in the United States, the outer space scenes feel vast, beautiful and all-encompassing.
It’s too bad there wasn’t more of this.
We get quite a few scenes of burning crop fields, but far less space pornography.
There are effects in ‘Interstellar’ that made me almost audibly gasp, then there are other effects where it looked like maybe the budget ran out.
There is a robot named TARS — which kind of resembles a walking monolith; there’s your arbitrary ’2001′ reference — that looks real.
I want to either purchase or meet TARS.
There’s a planet that Cooper’s crew visits  it’s the one you’ve seen in all of the trailers with the big tidal wave  that sits near a black hole.
It’s Nolan spinning the whole narrative, then forcing us to spin with him by using real science.
By the time we reach the planet’s surface – where, because of the gravity of the black hole, every hour spent there equals seven Earth years – we are in sync.
It all seems normal, even though everything is massively spinning out of control.
It is weird to think that everything we have accomplished as humans is all gone in a second if something happened to Earth.
Save for a few records of evidence floating through space, most of all recorded history vanishes once we do.
It’s a profound message: ‘Interstellar’ is about saving humanity, despite humanity.
It disguises itself in science, but ‘Interstellar’ isn’t really about science.
There’s a lot more Emotion in ‘Interstellar’ than I expected – its core foundation, really – but there’s almost too much going on in ‘Interstellar’ to the point that, at times, in retrospect, nothing is really happening even though it kind of seemed like something was happening.
There are entire swaths of this movie  I won’t get into specifics for risk of spoilers  that could be cut and it wouldn’t affect the narrative.
Case in point: There’s a fistfight in outer space that involves head butts and rocket boosters.
Basically, there’s an actor in ‘Interstellar” playing the Steve Buscemi role from ‘Armageddon’ – the crazy guy who screws everything up.
Up until this point, everything was so nuanced and so interesting, then it was decided that ‘Interstellar’ just had to have a head butting, rocket boosting intergalactic fistfight.
Interstellar’ is a good movie that so desperately wants to be important.
That sentence is going to read as churlish, but I do admire ‘Interstellar’ for at least attempting to be something that’s not dumb.
There are already too many dumb things we are subjected to on a daily basis.
And ‘Interstellar’ is ambitious, even though there are a lot of head-scratching scenes.
Yet, there we still are, spinning out of control with the reality that Nolan has created – and it’s only when we stop spinning, when we look at it from afar, that we kind of realize how absurd it all was … even though it leaves us craving a little more.

Christopher Nolan IS The Doctor!
Fantastic looking film, can t wait  PS is Chris Nolan surgically attached to that scarf?
He always seems to be wearing it!
Can’t find your city?
Try Time Out World for great nights out and all that’s going on near you – wherever you are in the world.
Magazines and Visitor Guides are also available in Malta, Porto and Muscat.
Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.
It’s a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike, and yet it always feels grounded in its own deadly serious reality.
It’s hard to talk about the story without ruining its slow drip of surprises.
So let’s be vague.
Cooper  Matthew McConaughey  lives with his family – his father-in-law  John Lithgow  and two young kids – in a not-too-distant future where living off huge fields of corn is the only business around.
Dust storms brew, and there’s an apocalyptic vibe, as if the Depression of the 1930s had been transplanted to a dying Earth.
Cooper has a strong bond with his daughter, Murph  Mackenzie Foy .
But when this former pilot is given a chance to head a mission into space, he grabs it.
It’s all very Messianic.
This rough-and-ready everyman’s destiny is to join a secret project to save the Earth directed by the ageing Professor Brand  Michael Caine .
And so he blasts into orbit in the company of Brand’s daughter  Anne Hathaway  and two other scientists  Wes Bentley, David Gyasi .
This is no bus hop to the Moon: their aim is to slip through a wormhole near Saturn and search for other planets capable of sustaining life.
Let’s just say that their return ticket is flexible.
You might understand the science  influenced by the involvement of physicist Kip Thorne , but the chances are you won’t.
Yet still ‘Interstellar’ inspires trust, and all the formulae and ample talk of wormholes is best taken as mood music.
Also, despite the cosmic canvas, ‘Interstellar’ is still one of the most earthbound films to date from Nolan, and the one most in tune with its emotions.
Even with Nolan’s early hit ‘Memento’  2000 , before he took on ‘The Dark Knight Trilogy’  2005-2012  and ‘Inception’  2010 , we knew we were exploring fairly chilly movie worlds.
Nolan is ably assisted in this respect by a cast you can believe in.
The real star is McConaughey: his earthy grit and family-man vulnerability are well placed: we believe his tears when the reality of multi-decade space travel sets in.
Meanwhile the father-daughter relationship between Caine and Hathaway hits home with a sharp brutality.
And brutal is the word: this is a sharp, tense experience.
There are some staggering visual coups: an ocean rising up to form the largest wave imaginable; a space ship floating past the rings of Saturn; a late scene which turns our perceptions of space and time on their head.
But alongside these thrills are moments of intense danger, and Nolan makes us feel the threat, honing in on mechanical problems and other everyday risks.
Parallels to Stanley Kubrick’s ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ are more than obvious; they’re ingrained: we’re invited to wonder at staggering imagery and listen to unnerving silence as well as Hans Zimmer’s organ-heavy score.
Nolan even offers his own spin on Kubrick’s HAL 9000 by giving us a shiny, walking robot that’s by far the cutest thing on display.
But where ‘Interstellar’ is more Spielberg than Kubrick is in the strained family relationships at its heart.
Yet the final tone is all Nolan’s: the film’s devastating emotional strands refuse to give way to empty sentiment and are embedded in a fractured sense of a nightmare unfolding before the eyes.
You’re better advised to come armed with an encyclopaedia, not a hankie, although in a seriously imaginative climactic scene – almost impossible to explain – science and sorrow are powerfully united.
Often when we talk about cinema being a ‘ride’, we’re hinting at a lack of substance, an absence of ideas, an opportunity to switch off.
Not so here.
Interstellar’ is, in large part, a spectacle.
But it also asks you to think hard, look hard and urges you to return for more.
Why only ask for the stars when you can have moons, distant planets, extra dimensions, lectures on psychics and a sobering shot of terror?
Interstellar’ has it all.
It s fair to say that Interstellar , the hotly anticipated science fiction film from director Christopher Nolan, is his darkest, slowest-moving and most uncompromising work yet.
This is not exactly the kind of thing a studio like Paramount may relish about a big-budget holiday season movie, especially not one opening Nov.
7, the same weekend as Big Hero 6, Disney s animated superhero spectacular.
But it s hard to spin this as a thrilling space epic.
The action sequences are few and far between, and unlike in Nolan s last complex big-budget epic, Inception, they are not played for Matrix-like fun.
Interstellar is somber, moody, and that s kind of the idea.
Until a series of uplifting surprises in the final 15 minutes or so — Nolan does love his last-minute twists — it s also rather depressing.
This isn t to say Interstellar is a bad movie; far from it.
It s just that you need to adjust your expectations accordingly.
This isn t Gravity; it s an audacious attempt to tackle the legacy of Stanley Kubrick s difficult but unsurpassed masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey head on, while simultaneously presenting a chilling, small-scale portrait of a future Earth ravaged by climate change.
All those spacecraft shots you ve been seeing in the trailers?
Yeah, we don t even leave planet Earth until about an hour into this three-hour film.
First, Nolan wants us to fully inhabit the drab lives of a widower called Cooper  Matthew McConaughey , his father  John Lithgow , and his kids Murph and Tom  played by a number of actors at various ages .
Cooper is a former test pilot and a reluctant farmer in a desperately hungry world.
The planet has turned into a giant dust bowl, everyone s getting asthmatic, and crops are falling victim to a virulent disease simply called Blight.
Wheat is gone; okra is gone; corn is all that s left.
Nolan tells us this not just through the Cooper family s diminished daily life, but through snippets of interviews with what appear to be actual survivors of the 1930s Dust Bowl.
The upshot is a chillingly believable Grapes of Wrath-style world, where everyone s an Okie.
We intuit that billions have already died, but no one dares mention the fact.
S.
A crappy baseball team called the New York Yankees comes to town, and Lithgow grumps about how in his day, they used to have real ballplayers.
That game is interrupted by a dust storm on the horizon, many miles high — the first of many shots where Nolan places tiny humans next to an overwhelming universe.
The storm leads to our first scene of young Murph as an amateur scientist, as she discovers strange messages communicated via pockets of dust on her bedroom floor.
The strange messages lead Cooper to an old NORAD facility.
That s where a ramshackle NASA and its chief scientist, played by Michael Caine, enter the picture.
Caine, an old mentor of Cooper s, persuades him to join a mission to save mankind — which is in such dire straits that Cooper, a relative rookie, turns out to be the best damn pilot on the planet.
There s a wormhole near Saturn, for some inherently unnatural reason, and he is to lead a mission back to three planets already explored  unbeknownst to the rest of mankind  on the other side.
It s at this point in a crowd-pleasing version of this movie — let s call it Sleepless in Space — that the widowed McConaughey would start sparking with his co-star, Anne Hathaway, a fellow inexperienced astronaut-scientist who happens to be Caine s daughter.
Nolan is a director who will resolutely wrong-foot your expectations.
McConaughey is too distraught over his daughter s obstinate refusal to accept his departure, so desirous of returning to her as fast as possible, that he barely looks at Hathaway as anything other than an obstacle.
This is a love story, but it s not romantic love.
At its core, this is a movie about a father s all-consuming need to save his kids  lives; it s about a love so fierce it s as if the rest of humanity doesn t exist.
Hathaway s character, Brand, has her own romantic reasons for traveling to a particular planet first.
In fact, Hathaway sells it so well that she s belongs in the conversation for a supporting actress nod, never more so than when delivering a powerful speech about how maybe, just maybe, love is a scientifically unknown-as-yet phenomenon that points us in the right direction when we re lost.
McConaughey and Hathaway s — sorry, Cooper and Brand s — mission is full of shocks and surprises, never more so than when a big Hollywood name appears on the second planet they visit.
This is late in the movie, the star is uncredited, and Nolan deliberately masks his identity earlier on, so I d feel uneasy as a reviewer about revealing his name.
But you can find it in a quick Google search.
Let s just say he s played this kind of role in a very major movie before.
So much that makes sense of the plot takes place in the third act, in fact, that this movie is a minefield of spoilers — caveat emptor about which reviews you read.
Suffice to say that Nolan hired world-renowned astrophysicist Kip Thorne as scientific adviser, and Thorne earns his money mostly in the last section, which deals in multiple dimensions and has a so-crazy-it-might-just-be-true feeling.
Again, let s just say one thing: Doctor Who fans will love it.
Or to take a more cinematic analogy, imagine 2001 s climactic sequence — the acid trip-like visual journey of astronaut David Bowman into the monolith on Jupiter, through a bedroom and into old age and rebirth — as if someone was actually explaining its infuriatingly silent twists and turns in time.
You ve got something close to the experience of the end of Interstellar.
I ll be arguing about in my head for days.
Too long or too short?
Kip Thorne-approved or scientifically dubious deus ex machina?
You have no idea what I m talking about, I m sure.
But don t worry, you will.
Because I think everyone who s interested enough to have gotten this far in the review needs to see it, if only to decide what parts of Nolan s vision they disagree with, and to appreciate the magnitude of that vision regardless.
It was mostly shot in IMAX, and there are certainly more than a few scenes that are worth seeing in that large format as I did, but I wouldn t say it s absolutely necessary to do so.
Interstellar itself is as big as a black hole, and it will suck you in; this movie did not feel three hours long.
The only real flaw, I d say, is Hans Zimmer s soundtrack — an attempt by the Dark Knight composer to try some new styles.
But what he came up with over-eggs the  space is really big  pudding.
We don t need his 2001-like big church organ sound, especially not since it hampers Nolan s bid to take one giant leap beyond Kubrick.
We also didn t need Zimmer s high pitched electronic experimentation over Michael Caine s all-important final speech.
Enemies of mumblecore may find a lot to dislike in the sound mixing, even if they can stand McConaughey s True Detective-style drawl.
In Interstellar, it is suggested that those three planets in the other galaxy may be imperfect versions of Earth —  but that the rump of humanity needs to go there anyway, if only to use them as stepping stones to our next world.
Similarly, this movie may not quite supersede 2001, but that s okay — it points the way to a cinematic discussion of humanity s inevitable future in space, like a stepping stone to something even greater.
Final verdict?
If you re looking for easy thrills and comical spills, go see Big Hero 6.
If you re looking for complex intergalactic chills, if you desire a slow-building punch to your heart and head, climb aboard the Interstellar train.

2005-2014 Mashable, Inc.
Christopher Nolan’s latest film, Interstellar , is not just one of the most anticipated movies arriving in Fall 2014 , but  for many cinephiles  one of the most talked about titles of 2014.
Per the norm for a Nolan production, though, much of that discussion has involved wondering just what the movie is even about.
It’s a known that the story by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan Nolan, involves a widowed pilot  Matthew McConaughey  who, along with a team of astronauts, goes on a mission into space to find a new planet for humanity to live on, in the face of a global ecological collapse on Earth.
Beyond that, much of the film – also starring Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, David Gyasi, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, and David Oyelowo  alongside  other notable acting talents   – remains largely shrouded in mystery, which is somewhat miraculous now that we’re less than two weeks away from the film’s theatrical release date.
The first wave of Interstellar reviews have hit the ‘Net, so we’ve gone and rounded up several excerpts from them, below – but don’t worry, they’re all SPOILER-FREE.
Variety - As visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done, the director’s ninth feature also proves more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and Batman movies.
It s] an enormous undertaking that, like all the director’s best work, manages to feel handcrafted and intensely personal, “Interstellar” reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place alongside “The Wizard of Oz,” “2001,” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “Gravity” in the canon of Hollywood’s visionary sci-fi head trips.
THR -  so bulges with ideas, ambitions, theories, melodrama, technical wizardry, wondrous imagery and core emotions that it was almost inevitable that some of it would stick while other stuff would fall to the floor.
Feeling very much like Christopher Nolan’s personal response to his favorite film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.
The Wrap –  a filmmaker with a keen visual sense but also one who undercuts the big, challenging ideas of his movies with unnecessarily tidy resolutions.
In that respect, “Interstellar” may represent an apotheosis of sorts, as it illustrates the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director.
On the plus side, there’s a stunning portrayal of how far-reaching space travel might work, a glimpse at an apocalyptic near-future that’s both brilliantly written  designed  and a vision of robots like nothing I’ve ever seen in a movie…  the resolution of “Interstellar” feels so inorganic and milquetoast that you’d swear it was concocted by a Glendale focus group.
Badass Digest - There are so many frustrating flaws in this enormously cerebral, wonderfully hopeful and massively ambitious movie.
If good intentions were enough to make a movie a masterpiece, Interstellar would be the greatest work of Nolan’s career.
That said, even with its many flaws, Interstellar is an often gorgeous, expertly put-together movie that demands to be seen on the biggest possible screen.
And while many parts of Interstellar don’t work, the whole hangs together enough to be a movie that impresses with hard sci-fi nerdiness.
If only that were enough to make it the great film we hoped for.
Coming Soon - “Interstellar” is another one of Christopher Nolan’s more personal mind-f*ck movies… While it may not be as immediate as “Inception” and it wears most of its most obvious influences on its sleeve, it’s still very much the type of intelligent spin on a specific genre we’ve come to expect from the filmmaker…  Christopher Nolan’s love letter to space travel and the exploration of the stars may require some patience, both with its pace and your own capability of understanding complex time space theories, but it offers an incredible emotional payoff along with its visual spectacle.
Time Out - Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.
It’s a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike, and yet it always feels grounded in its own deadly serious reality.
In summation, Interstellar has thus far earned much in the way of critical acclaim for its ambitious ideas, as well as  the scientific research  that informs its world-building and plot.
However, given the amount of envelope pushing, it comes as little surprise that Interstellar  according to the early reviews  can be messy at times – before it concludes with some third-act developments that feel less than innovative, compared to what came before.
Truth be told, Interstellar sounds like Inception – big ideas wrapped around a simpler personal story.
Difference is, Inception also has the entertainment value of an exciting heist thriller to offer, whereas Interstellar clearly resembles Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey not just thematically, but also in terms of that film’s slow and steady pacing.
Which is to say, certain moviegoers who enjoyed Inception might find Nolan’s latest sci-fi mind-trip to be… well, a bit boring by comparison  the nearly 3-hour running time probably won’t help in that regard .
That said, just about everyone so far seems to agree that Interstellar is worth seeing in the biggest format possible, for the visuals alone.
Similar to 2001, it may well be that Nolan’s latest film is one that many people will warm more towards after they’ve had more time to think on it  and or perhaps after giving it a second viewing .
Interstellar opens in select IMAX theaters on November 5th, 2014; it begins a wide theatrical release two days later.

Judgeing by the early reviews on here and rotten tomatoes.
If he’s inspired to make this movie like 2001.
He’s off to a great start seeing how mixed the reviews are.
Now the movie needs to do disappointingly at the boxoffice and then watched over the years by every one until one day it winds up being hailed as a masterpiece and never to have a negative review again.
Any Christopher Nolan film is worth seeing because it is a Christopher Nolan film.
For that reason alone I would see this.
And for the fact Christopher is the General leading the charge for film shot on film and presented on film and that is one war I want to see won.
This is being shown projected on 70 mm IMAX film in a theater near me and my ticket is on my desk.
Yeah, there are very few directors that I will blindly trust 100%.
Nolan is one of them.
I’ve definitely been let down, but I will watch anything he directs without question.
Please correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t 2001 get really mixed reviews at it’s release as well?
Just like I was teasing about in the above comment.
Yes it did get highly mixed reviews and the reason for that is a masterpeice isn’t considered a masterpiece over night.
It’s a title the movie gains as it ages and usally a masterpiece does disappointingly at first but then people watch it more dissect it get the point it was trying to make or just look into things that wasn’t even there.
Bam!
A masterpiece is not a movie that was made with alot of money or get perfect reviews from the get go.
A masterpeice gains it’s title by what people get from it as it ages.
How about you settle down with this talk until you have actually seen the movie.
I should also add: The Dark Knight was “deemed” a masterpiece by Nolan fans LITERALLY overnight.
I really don’t think that’s a valid comparison.
2001 was extremely inaccessible, impersonal, and obtuse.
This looks much more conservative and less experimental.
I can’t wait!
I imagine the flaws will be forgotten in a few years.
2001 is also a flawed movie, but it’s appreciated now for its vision more than anything.
Well that’s the thing isn’t it.
2001 had mixed reviews when it came out…I think we’re in for a treat.
I’m one who has patience for 3 hours as well.
Can’t wait.
Lo and behold, snobism.
Who the hell is Christopher Nolan and why should anyone think this movie is any good beforehand?
1.
Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins Dark Knight Dark Knight Rises, and Inception.
That’s Christopher Nolan and why we believe in a blind watch for his work.
Thanks, IMDb.
I know what movies he’s made.
I don’t like all of them.
I don’t do blind things.
I’m not particularly interested in this movie, but if I watch it and like it, I’ll say so.
Not a second sooner.
You need to knock Dark Knight Rises off that list and then I’d agree with you 100%.
Thank you, I’m not the only one who didn’t like TDKR.
When I tell people I didn’t like it, they say “you just fell for the hype, it is still a really good movie though” and I say by any standards it is a lackluster movie that felt rushed without conclusion that has lots of plot holes and character inconsistencies.
Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were both solid movies on their own that each have their own theme.
But I have no clue what TDKR theme is, and it doesn’t stand alone as a film you could show to someone who has never seen a superhero film.
It was like it was trying to be a little bit of both of the previous films but not as polished and no cohesive story arc.
I do like Christopher Nolan a lot, but I think there are a lot of ways to compare him to M.
Night Shyamalan, made quite a few good movies in a row, had a similar technique tying them together, obsessive secrecy and advertising, and over hyped.
Nolans films amaze you with presentation and end with a twist.
What I hope Nolan can do that Shyamalan didn’t, is to continue to impress.
And if Interstellar is good, I will always trust Nolan.
But TDKR really rubbed me the wrong way.
It was too self formulatic, just like Shyamalans films ended up being.
To Imax I will go in a couple weeks.
I don’t understand where you’re coming from?
Do you have a problem with Nolan or the idea that people can be positive towards a movie before it even comes out?
I’m not particularly a fan of his, but I have nothing against him.
Just the notion that people assume the movie will be food because of who’s directing is what I’m against.
You don’t have to like everything one artist makes.
I suppose you don’t have to like everything one artist makes, but many people have liked everything he has made  hence why he is lauded as one of the greatest directors artists of a generation .
So if you have liked everything he has made previously, one is bound to assume that this will be good as well due to precedent.
You call this being snobish?
I call it being a fan.
For the record, this isn’t to say that Interstellar is guaranteed to be good, no movie is.
Just based on past experience it seems logical to assume and hope, as a fan of the artist, that this should also be good.
There can be an air of fanboyism with many who laud Nolan’s work, but I find no “snobism” in expecting a good experience from an upcoming movie if the director’s got a solid track record.
It may make one feel above the herd to play the contrarian whenever someone or something gets wildly popular, but whether you like something because it’s popular or hate something because it’s popular, you’re still allowing the opinions of others sway your own.
I disagree.
I think it’s totally snobism.
And fanboyism as well.
I have no expectations on a movie based on the director, writer or actors.
Any movie can be bad.
I don’t find the premise of this movie interesting at all, so I’m not excited for it.
But most people seem to already love this movie just because it’s made by Nolan.
That’s just short-sighted.
There’s nothing to disagree or agree with here.
If I feel a director has a history of doing good work, then I will be more inclined to think he will continue to do good work.
If you feel Nolan has a history of doing poor work, then you will feel more inclined to feel that he will continue to output overrated schlock.
Just because you are personally averse to this movie doesn’t mean that everyone who disagree with you are immediately falling into some snobby, bandwagon, groupthink.
How about, they just recognize a pattern of excellence and intelligently posit that the pattern will continue?
Is that a difficult scenario to entertain?
I feel sorry for you.
I’m not sure how someone can be a movie fan but not understand excitement for a movie based off who is directing.
Nice try at being hip though.
Honey, I personally don’t like to put Nolan on a pedestal.
I think people overrate him a lot.
But he is still good at what he does.
Wanting to see Interstellar is not snobbism.
It is wanting to see a good movie.
The snobism part is thinking Nolan is a superior director and that the movie will be good just because he’s making it.
If you saw this movie’s trailer and it didn’t say “directed by Nolan” people wouldn’t be as excited.
The film hasnt even been seen yet and commenters are saying it’s getting mixed reviews because some people are too stupid to understand it.
Or how about the constant comparison to 2001?
This might as well be a bottle of some expensive wine.
It doesn’t matter what it actually tastes like, but if you don’t like it, you’re an uncultured swine.
The only positive so far, for me, is that this isn’t Inception.
Thank goodness.
I like high ideas delivered in a manner that allows us viewers to take it in.
It looks like this movie delivers where Inception couldn’t.
I for one am ready nd can’t wait for this.
These reviews are reminding me of Contact, with detractors claiming over-sentimentality while still praising the scale and ambition, and perfect scores from reviewers who bought in.
I think that much like Contact, opinion of the film will hinge on the viewers ability to buy into the film’s “heart”, if they feel the emotional beats are earned.
As someone who wholeheartedly loved Contact, i’m a little more excited for this now, and can’t wait to see it.
I remember watching Contact as a very angry person.
It was referred to me by someone I didn’t really agree with on a philosophical level and very much went in wanting to DISLIKE the film  pfft.
ME to watch a movie to have a different opinion?
The NERVE of some people!
And yeah, I didn’t enjoy the movie all that much back then.
I wasn’t open to it.
A decade later.
Watching Contact without being a jerk about it, I really loved it!
It’s the sort of film that needs to be mentioned more at sci-fi conventions.
So yeah, I agree with you: a lot of it deals with whether or not people agree with the message.
I cannot wait to see it.
Nolan was taking a lot of notes from the other space-age story that didn’t go well with any cinephiles: Ridley Scott’s Prometheus, and followed that up with giving notes to Snyder on MoS  which featured VERY Ridley Scott-esque aesthetic and World Engineer-suggestions for the Kryptonians .
In many ways, Interstellar is that story that we only glimpsed at from Nolan.
So I am extremely eager to go and see what it’s all about from a superhero point of view.
Of course it won’t click with a lot of people, even The Winter Soldier didn’t and that’s slowly becoming one of my favourite superhero flicks out there.
Point is, you watch Guardians of the Galaxy with its immensely light-hearted tone and deem it a universal success, well this is the antithesis to that but that shouldn’t make it any less successful.
Side note: For all the grief that Nolan gets for TDKR, I wonder if fans would see the movie differently if it really WAS released 8 years after TDK?
Yeah, I saw TDKR as a part of a marathon the theater put on, where we watched BB, then TDK, then TDKR at midnight.
I’ve always regretted that.
The ending of TDK is the polar opposite of the beginning of TDKR.
It was a grating contrast.
I felt like we missed a movie in the middle.
Exactly, it felt like a drastic shift, one that a little distance in time might have made less drastic somehow?
Or would that simply go the way of The Godfather Part III?
I’m not a fan of 2001, but maybe because I wasn’t around for the original release.
I will be seeing this movie for sure and still cannot wait.
I love it when early reviews are mixed.
I’ve noticed lately that movies receiving universal acclaim leave me feeling a bit cheated.
Fury was a great movie, but not breathtaking.
Why didn’t you like 2001?
The first time I saw it in my 20′s, I didn’t really get it either.
Later, when I gave it another chance, in my 30′s and 40′s, it grew on me and I learned to appreciate.
Now, I can honestly say I love it, as long as you have patience in the the story-telling.
I don’t mean to be patronizing, but lots of things we don’t understand or appreciate until we get older.
Just a fact of life.
S.
I thought Fury was pretty good.
I stopped expecting “breathtaking” many years ago.
Now, I just happy to see a good story.
Yeah, a lot of really good movies go over most young peoples’ heads because they’re not so much meant to hold your attention as they are to tell a good story.
I was fortunate enough to have watched  and both understood and enjoyed  2001 at age 15, but even my 47 year old mom watched it with me and didn’t get it at all because the entire movie wasn’t laid out nicely for her.
Clarke and Kubrick made about how the imagery was meant to impact the viewer subconsciously and people weren’t supposed to “understand” the movie on a rational level.
Interesting!
I didn’t know that.
Kubrick was way ahead of his time.
But my favorite of his films is Barry Lyndon.
It doesn’t really have anything to do with my age.
Unfortunately, this is the real reason why I’m not a big fan: Having gone to art school to study film, there were two movies that seemed to just be the end-all of movies for every one of my classmates— 2001 and Pulp Fiction.
EVERY conversation.
EVERY critique.
EVERY suggestion simply HAD to refer to one of these two movies, or both… It was just exhausting.
It was like no other movie came out before these – classical example of modernists not studying the history of where their movement came from.
So I’ve just been nurtured into a state of over-criticizing both movies.
Not like I don’t think they’re good, I’m just not the biggest fan of either.
I assume you’re unfamiliar with all the comments Clarke and Kubrcik have made about how the imagery in 2001 was meant to be experienced on a visceral, subconscious level and how the film didn’t lend itself to logical comprehension?
The first time I saw 2001 when I was 15 or 16 for the first few minutes I thought I was watching the wrong movie.
I remember seeing it was on in the TV Guide  remember those  and after hearing about the amazing movie it was I turned it on and thought somebody made a mistake.
I was expecting outer space and was seeing Apes.
I had no idea what I was seeing.
I finished the movie but I had no idea what I just watched.
I just didn’t get it.
In the years since I’ve watched it 3 or 4 times and with each viewing I like and appreciate it more and more.
That’s been the case with every Kubrick movie I’ve seen.
The older I get and my impression of the world around me changes the more I appreciate his work and have a better appreciation of the stories he told.
This may be true for my relationship with 2001 eventually… but read my comment above as to why I don’t like it and you will understand haha.
Kubrick is a great director.
Strangelove was way ahead of its time.
The first time I watched it I was 14  15 years ago  and I thought it was amazing and have only grown to love it more.
My appreciation for the Shining is that it is the only horror movie I can watch that is genuinely disturbing every time.
Eyes Wide Shut… totally put off by it– don’t think I’ll ever like it.
As far as 2001 goes, I just don’t dig it because any above-average appreciation for the movie I might have had was beaten out of me by oversaturation… like the Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari in that one Portlandia sketch.
I have to disagree with you.
Some masterpieces do make money and have great initial reviews.
An example would be Casablanca & Godfather & Godfather Part II, Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kiwi, just to name a few.
This has been my most anticipated film for this year, and these early reviews simply make me feel even better about.
Comment section: BUT DIDN’T 2001 GET MIXED REVIEWS BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED?
I really don’t get why people expect the next 2001 A Space Odyssey with Interstellar.
Christopher Nolan’s film looks far too melodramatic and cliched to be as revolutionary as 2001, yes the trailer revealed enough for me to know that.
I love most of Christopher Nolan’s movies, but after The Dark Knight Rises there’s a lot of reasons to doubt his skill as a storyteller.
I think we should call Nolan a story Presenter and not a story teller.
His movies always have a way of keeping your eyes glued to the screen, but as far as making stories himself intricate or beautifully profound I still think Nolan still has to prove himself in that regard.
Half of the reason Inception was amazing was the Fog horn blaring in the theaters bass making me laugh because I was overwhelmed while the hallway did a 360.
If Nolan is given a pretty bad story  like TDKR  he can make it a pretty good film experience, despite leaving the theater saying I don’t know why anything in the movie happened the way it did, but I enjoyed it.
I think that is where his artistry lies.
I hope Interstellar is the movie where he gets both sides the story and the presentation perfectly right, like in the Dark Knight.
I’m still expecting this to be my favorite movie of the year, Nolan is one of the best directors working today and I’ve liked every film he has made so far.
I would kind of hate myself if I actually don’t like this, that’s how much I want to love this movie.
I always feel that I have to watch out for high expectations on things.
This is the second of two of the most anticipated films of the year for me, so I am trying to be neutral about it going in.
I haven’t watched any trailers, and don’t want to know anything about it.
I just will be there on opening day.
I love every movie this guy has made so far.
Even “Following” is cool.
I am trying to keep my stance neutral on this, but it isn’t easy when you already have expectations for it.
Regardless,  I’m sure the film will spark internet flame wars.
If that line of this article turns out to be true, I can assure that I will love this film.
See ‘Insomnia’ , then you’ll see.
I still think his masterpiece was either ‘Memento’ or ‘The Prestige’.
I agree with you 100% about Memento and The Prestige.
I would rank those two with The Dark Knight as his best work.
But I disagree about Insomnia.
I used to think it wasn’t all that good but I re-watched it on Netflix a while back and liked it a lot more than I remembered.
I wouldn’t go out and say it’s one of his best but I now kind of feel it gets a bad rap that it doesn’t deserve.
Funny how everyone is turning this in to a positive.
I love Chris Nolan as much as the next guy.
When he makes a film, I’m there opening night.
The man isn’t perfect.
I wouldn’t be shocked if he miss fires on this film.
Even when he made the mediocre at best Dark Knight Rises people still praised him.
Reading these reviews my guess it’s a little above average sci fi film.
Which will be a huge disappointment.
Bar is set high  maybe to high  for Mr.
Nolan.
2001 a space oddysey still has mix reviews.
Visually ahead of its time for sure.
That’s about the only positive thing I can say about that movie.
But then I again I dislike or hate almost all of Stankleys K’s films.
LOL, all the Nolan-ites over here justifying all the bad reviews in the comments!
Derpa DERRR!
The Walking Dead up in this B****.
Let’s all shuffle along to the next thing with Nolan’s name even though TDKR sucked.
Your comment reeks of stupidity.
No one is justifying bad reviews, are you mad that there are still more positive reviews?
Does that hurt you child?
Also, even the bad reviews have sung praises for aspects of this film.
So go back to your cave troll.
Interstellar Audiences have understandably become expectant of the unexpected from Christopher Nolan.
In his 16 years as a filmmaker, he has excelled in changing our perceptions of narrative and genre, be it with the backwards-running Memento, the cerebral blockbuster Inception, or the Oscar-winning Dark Knight trilogy.
Nolan is a filmmaker we turn to when we want something outside of the norms and deliver something that is both  unordinary  and exists on a massive scale.
Predictable isnt a word wed expect to be uttered within 10 miles of a Christopher Nolan movie - and yet its painfully necessarily in discussion of Interstellar, Nolans aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama that is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution.
The story of a last-ditch space expedition hoping to find a new home for the human race after a blight has left the future Earth slowly dying, the film is far from subtle with what is a very positive and important allegory and message: the answer to our species outliving our planet rests in the stars, and we will never reach them if our space programs remain underfunded and underutilized.
Spliced with a good dose of theoretical physics -- as well as a Spielberg-esque father-daughter drama that finds a farmer former pilot named Cooper  Matthew McConaughey  leaving his family behind to lead the aforementioned mission -- the film is high-minded, but ultimately taken down by a mix of both obvious and overly-confusing plot maneuverings.
Big mysteries introduced at the start are solvable instantaneously, and far too often, big questions arent asked until its convenient for the plot.
While script elements loosely hold the film together, it doesnt undercut Nolans gift for spectacle, and there are many breathtaking sequences that are honestly set up in the narrative and are visually magnificent.
Without giving away too many details  its truly best for the film to open up to you on the big screen  the destinations where the space-searching crew wind up are remarkable and create some terrific, intense drama, and the production design and practical approach truly allows the audience to get lost in the cinematic experience.
Whats more, the directors embrace of 70mm filmmaking once again generates an invigorating epic feel and an immersive quality that makes you feel like youre going to fall into the pool of stars trillions of miles away.
To help tell the story of Interstellar, Nolan once again enlists a large cast of both big name stars and talented character actors, and all perform admirably  though one clearly sticks out above all others.
Continuing his career renaissance, McConaughey once again proves himself a strong, charismatic leading man, and he does so here playing Cooper with great duality: one side of him reaching for the stars and beyond, the other side never wanting to let go of his family.
The Oscar-winning star plays both sides of the character with great passion and serves as a terrific conduit for the audience.
Of course, the side effect of having one character stand out so much in a large ensemble is that everyone else gets overshadowed  and while the rest of the cast does its job, they also arent exactly given a ton of material to work with.
Cruising through the stars alongside McConaughey, Anne Hathaway is given the second most development and screentime  far more than Wes Bentley and David Gyasi , and really that only extends to rather vague relationships she has to other key figures in the plot.
Jessica Chastain does most of the heavy lifting back on Earth,  playing Coopers daughter as an  adult and dealing with more than her fair share of abandonment issues, and while she effectively sells the drama, she is also stuck on the much less dynamic side of the story.
There is an earned level of expectation that will come packaged along with Christopher Nolans film as it arrives in theaters, and those expectations will result in a mixed emotional response.
There is no question that Interstellar delivers in terms of spectacle, as the movie is immersive, scattered with gorgeous photography, and demands to be shown on the biggest screen imaginable.
But its also hard not to be disappointed by its limited scope, creatively.

Interstellar is the astounding new $160 million sci-fi epic from Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan .
Made under the supervision of leading theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film  bound to be a front runner in this year’s Oscar race  launches a twin pronged attack on our emotions and on our intellects.
It combines abstruse ideas about gravity, matter and time with old fashioned, hyper-charged family melodrama.
With a running time of almost three hours and special effects that trump those in Gravity  which seems like a chamber piece by comparison , this is a true epic - one whose thrilling ambition is only partially undermined by its sudden final reel nose dive into bathos and absurdity.
Nolan aims very high indeed.
In the process, he has delivered a cerebral and original blockbuster that  thankfully  is the utter antithesis of Transformers-style franchise filmmaking.
This is a story of deliberate contrasts.
The narrative begins not in space but in the dusty midwest.
The crops are failing and food is scarce.
Cooper   Matthew McConaughey   is a rugged farmer who looks as if he has stepped out of a John Steinbeck novel.
In a post-apocalyptic world when families are struggling to put food on the table, the idea of space travel seems absurd.
Cooper is told by his kids’ school teachers that he is part of a “caretaker generation,” whose only goal is survival.
The screenplay  co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan  has certain elements that would barely have passed muster in an old episode of the Twilight Zone.
We learn that Cooper, in spite of his Tom Joad-like appearance, is, in fact, a former a test pilot and engineer.
After seeing strange signs in the farmhouse, he and his 10 year old daughter Murph head off across country and stumble on a secret NASA base in the desert.
Here, he is signed up by his old professor  Michael Caine  to join a space voyage in search of new habitations for humanity.
Among the astronauts is the professor’s beautiful daughter Amelia Brand   Anne Hathaway  .
The hitch is that he may never see his own children again - and if he does, they may be very much older than he is by the time he returns.
Cooper is heading toward planets on which every hour that passes counts for seven years back on earth .
Nolan is very sly in the way he interweaves sci-fi and family drama elements.
There are continual references to “love” and family ties as key drivers in humanity’s fight for survival.
The reason the scientists can push themselves so hard is precisely because they are fighting to protect those closest to them.
McConaughey’s performance is almost as strong as his Oscar winning turn in The Dallas Buyers’ Club .
He conveys Cooper’s bravado and pioneer spirit as well as his desperate yearning for the children he left behind.
Nolan isn’t afraid to squeeze out the pathos from the scenes in which he cries his eyes out watching video messages which from his family.
Hathaway is likewise affecting as the scientist torn between her professional responsibilities and her feelings.
Back on earth, Jessica Chastain shows her familiar steely drive as the physicist who looks to the most emotional events of her childhood to solve the scientific problems that have dogged her colleagues for decades.
The filmmakers give a very far-fetched story an air of verisimilitude by borrowing Warren Beatty’s tactics in Reds and featuring interview footage with various old-timers  including one played by Ellen Burstyn  who reminisce about the events we are seeing as if this is a documentary.
As in Gravity, the filmmakers use the silence of space to accentuate the eeriness.
Hans Zimmer’s music, heavy on organs, has a sacral feel.
The film combines lengthy passages of the vessel gliding through galaxies as the astronauts discuss their strategies for saving humanity with exhilarating set-pieces in which they’re dragged through black holes in space or worm holes in time.
This is a film that will provide plenty of grist for sci-fi enthusiasts.
It boasts its own HAL-like computers - the very sardonic TARS and the quietly spoken CASE.
There is lots of hardware, plenty of explosions and and large amounts of jargon-filled dialogue.
In a cameo, Matt Damon makes one of the great screen entrances of recent times.
Homebase has announced the closure of one in four of its stores.

Without a doubt, Christopher Nolan‘s Interstellar is one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2014.
But whether it’ll deliver on those sky-high expectations is another question altogether.
The first Interstellar reviews are in, and they’re really all over the map.
Hit the jump for the Interstellar review roundup.
In summary: Visually, Nolan seems to remain at the top of the game.
Where critics are divided is is handling of the emotional material.
Nolan has a reputation for being a chilly director, but he reportedly tries to nail the more sentimental aspects of the story here… with either incredible results or disastrous ones, depending on whom you ask.
But even a Nolan failure is more interesting than lots of filmmaker’s successes, and Interstellar definitely sounds worth a look.
Interstellar is ambitious, beautiful, Christopher Nolan‘s most emotional film to date.
The story allows us to explore many big ideas we wouldn’t normally see in a big budget studio film, but the ideas sometimes fly by at light speed, squeezed into popcorn cinema.
The result is that the story is left with some holes of logic.
As someone who enjoyed Prometheus, I can see past this kind of thing when the overall experience is enjoyable.
I think others may have problems with some of these logistical issues.
But even those critics will agree that Interstellar is a film not to be missed in its theatrical run – the movie must be experienced in a big theater, projected in 70mm or on an IMAX film screen if possible.
Nolan is a filmmaker we turn to when we want something outside of the norms and deliver something that is both “unordinary” and exists on a massive scale.
Predictable” isn’t a word we’d expect to be uttered within 10 miles of a Christopher Nolan movie – and yet it’s painfully necessarily in discussion of Interstellar, Nolan’s aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama that is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution.
Christopher Nolan’s overwhelming, immersive and time-bending space epic ‘Interstellar’ makes Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity’ feel like a palate cleanser for the big meal to come.
Where ‘Gravity’ was brief, contained and left the further bounds of the universe to our imagination, ‘Interstellar’ is long, grand, strange and demanding – not least because it allows time to slip away from under our feet while running brain-aching ideas before our eyes.
It’s a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike, and yet it always feels grounded in its own deadly serious reality.
Interstellar opens November 7.

Interstellar hits theaters November 7.
The enigma that is the space odyssey “ Interstellar ” will get solved when the film hits theaters in November, but until then, Christopher Nolan has revealed a few clues.
The director divulged in a cover story for Entertainment Weekly that the movie is more comparable to the Stanley Kubrick classic “ 2001: A Space Odyssey ” than his own Batman films.
Unlike his “Dark Knight” trilogy, Nolan insists that “Interstellar” can be experienced on its own, independently of the characters.
Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine and Casey Affleck are among the actors who bring the characters to life.
This is the first film I have made where the actual experience of the film is paramount to the audience,” Nolan told EW .
You would think that’s the case with Batman movies, but it’s not.
They’re more dependent on the reaction of characters on screen.
Interstellar’ is different.
Nolan also told the mag the the film is akin to “Treasure of the Sierra Madre” in the sense that it focuses on human nature.
The film is about human nature, what it means to be human,” he said.
It sounds like a very grand statement, but I don’t intend it to be.
I mean it in the way, say, ‘Treasure of the Sierra Madre’ is about dramatizing ideas of human nature.
When you take an audience far away from human experience as possible, you wind up focusing very tightly on human nature and how we are connected to each other.
Interstellar” hits theaters on Nov.

Based on his “Batman” trilogy  of which the only good part was Gary Oldman – i never would have believed that anyone could make Bane an even stupider character than he was in the comics , i have to ask: What would he know about that?

Imagine if astronaut Dave of  2001: A Space Odyssey  returned to Earth as a star child in order to use his superior brain power to build better solar panels.
It seems mighty narrow and would have trivialized Stanley Kubrick s classic film.
Well, something like that might be happening with another movie,  Interstellar,  opening on November 7.
A crew is sent via a wormhole to find another planet far across the universe.
Why?
In order to discover a place to grow corn because the crops on earth have been ruined due to climate change aka global warming.
Nolan and his crew turned to Kip Thorne, a renowned US theoretical physicist who has long studied the far reaches of the universe, for help on creating the black hole the astronauts travel through.
Nolan said parts of a spaceship were also built and used on the set, rather than a green screen or special effects.
If you look at this film and you look at where we are right now in the world — and the climate changes that’s happening … You have to push forward and evoke some kind of positive change in your life, in the world,” Chastain said.
Uh-oh!
Reportedly, this future-set film centers on the tremendous destruction climate change has wrought on agriculture.
As a result, these time space-tripping scientists are said to be seeking out a place where crops can be grown.
This is the first we’ve heard anything about Interstellar involving climate change, but gives some insight into the scene setup the reporter goes on to detail.
Wait, is this an ecological hippie liberal goofball message film?
I just pray the reason earth is doomed isn t some ecological hippie liberal  we poisoned the planet  goofball reason.
Exit Question: Can the corn grown on the planet on the other side of the wormhole be used for popcorn for the folks in the audience to munch on while laughing at the absurd political trivializing of what could have been an interesting sci-fi movie?

Ahead of the release of Christopher Nolan’s hotly anticipated space movie Interstellar, the film-makers reveal how theoretical physicist Kip Thorne helped them to create scientifically accurate special effects for a black hole.
It’s a pretty clever piece of marketing for the movie, which has relied on the mysterious nature of its under-wraps script and the odd teaser trailer to build up a pretty impressive amount of anticipation.
It’s also pretty cool.
Thorne said several technical papers would come out of the maths and practical work that went into creating the movie’s black hole, one for the astrophysics community and others for computer graphics specialists on what the team discovered about gravitational lensing.
The movie hits cinemas on 7 November in the UK and 4 November in the US.

There used to be a time when we would look up at the stars and dream.
We would wonder what it was like out there, what we might find out amongst the endless black of space.
But then things changed, we became obsessed with ourselves again, with battling each other for money and power, and we forgot how to dream.
Along comes Interstellar, an exhilarating science fiction creation that once again reminds us that we can dream, that we get to breathe this fresh air on this beautiful planet, that we get to smile, cry and laugh.
And it s those feelings that matter the most.
It reminds us that the desire to connect is one of the most important aspects of humanity and that nothing–whether it be time or space or others–can break those bonds of love.
For me, it is a love for cinema.
A love for the spectacle, and the incomparable experience of the big screen.
While we do get to see hundreds of movies every year, very rarely do modern movies balance both story and spectacle, combining breathtaking visuals with deeply felt emotions.
More often than not it happens to be the science fiction genre that combines both sides to perfection, and in recent years this includes work like Avatar and Gravity.
For me, it s all about the feelings, the exhilaration, which is achieved through technical mastery and storytelling genius, and with Interstellar we get the very rare, immaculate balance of both.
It s as easy to tear up at the beautiful shots of Saturn as it is the moving moments between Cooper and Murph.
Set in the not-too-distant future, Interstellar is almost Nolan s attempt at a re-envisioned modern version of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
The focus is on humanity, specifically a family, and how they are affected when a father ends up being called on to  save the world .
This is only the beginning, as the mission of Endurance leads them through a wormhole to another galaxy far, far away to look for a new home, or at least look for answers or clues or ideas about how to save the human race  stuck back on Earth .
It s best experienced without knowing anything beyond this, but for the sake of following up on that 2001 comparison, where it leads is: what is humanity?
And what is our place in this vast universe?
Yes, Christopher Nolan goes that far with Interstellar.
And I love it.
I love that he was that ambitious with the script - all the way and back.
Ever since 2001, Hollywood more often than not ends up twisting science and reality when it comes to sci-fi entertainment in ways that often seem false.
However, last year Gravity turned things around proving that sticking to science is financially lucrative and impresses critics , even if there isn t any sound in space.
I m so glad we re now in an era where movies set in space do beautifully respect the laws of physics – for the most part  something that astrophysicist & executive producer Kip Thorne is happy about too, I m sure .
And, not-so-surprisingly, giving it that grounded feeling enhances the experience because it allows us to believe this is possible.
Within Interstellar, the experience of Gravity is just one scene inside a much bigger story; Nolan takes us on an Apollo program -inspired journey that is truly breathtaking and mesmerizing to behold.
After originally believing we were the center of the universe, this movie once again reminds us to wonder where our place is in an incredibly vast universe outside of the solar system.
It s not that we don t already wonder, but that this movie is the realization of our wildest dreams.
They brought our  what if we really could?  dreams to life, perhaps just on the big screen, but it s enough to inspire.
The scientific details aren t particularly mind blowing, in all truth, and seem somewhat muted just enough for most to be intrigued yet not overwhelmed.
The script sets up a number of complex connections, the kind Nolan is known for  think The Prestige  that link back to one another throughout  so pay attention , and his magic trick is making it all flow seamlessly, keeping viewers on the edge of the seat in wonder waiting for the next  wow  moment.
After this first viewing  and I can t wait for my next one  my honest feeling is that the first half has a few minor speed-bumps before launching into the phenomenal second half, which is where the entire experience expands our horizons towards the greatest possibilities of interstellar exploration, for the most part, and what s out there.
There are a few twists, however, and one big discovery in the later half is a bit odd even though it helps mix things up, but it s certainly going to be a divisive reveal.
Coming in just 11 minutes shy of three hours, Interstellar does run very long and has a few snags along the way but builds to a conclusion that makes us contemplate our potential in this universe.
It s an epic, thought-provoking, emotional finale.
More than anything, Interstellar is an emotional movie, crafted with emotion  Christopher Nolan and his wife, producer Emma Thomas, have four children together  and designed to pack an emotional punch.
It s the strongest part of Nolan s sci-fi extravaganza, and it needs to be, as love is such an important part of human life on this very planet that this movie needs something we can all latch onto and empathize with even though none of us have ever been to space  yet .
The story is framed around Cooper s relationship with his daughter Murph  but not as much with his son  and it s one of the most vital aspects of the story, very similar to Contact, with the driving force being love.
Continuing his streak of recent outstanding performances  I love Mud the most , Matthew McConaughey carries the weight of this massive emotional adventure on his shoulders and does a fantastic job giving it his all.
Everyone else is impressive, with minor roles throughout getting excellent performances from talented actors.
One of my favorites is David Gyasi as  Romilly , another astronaut who joins Cooper and the crew on the interstellar voyage.
There s one scene with him that got me to shed a tear, and it all hinged on a bit of real science, making it all the more impactful.
Even Anne Hathaway gives a restrained performance as the somewhat pessimistic  Brand , however I believe there s much more to her and she opens up a few times in important moments.
Mackenzie Foy as Murph establishes the emotion and gives us the strength to hold on the rest of the time.
Keep an eye out for Topher Grace and Jessica Chastain in their unique roles, too, plus there s John Lithgow always making us smile, and I must mention Bill Irwin in a key voice role.
If I speak honestly, there s so much I want to openly discuss about Interstellar but must hold back in order to prevent spoiling the experience.
However, it s a bold and epic creation worthy of vigorous discussion.
Not to give away anything big, but aside from an interstellar voyage, this movie has wormholes, black holes, robots, spaceships, astronauts, rockets, drones, NASA, sleep chambers, and some other tricks up its sleeve.
I want to talk about why this character made these choices and said these things, and what they were really looking for, and what happens at this point, and why it goes where it goes at the end.
I want to talk about the robots, and why Nolan chose to use them the way he did, and how they have a direct connection to some of the most integral parts of the bigger story.
There are a few scenes along the way that seem to skip right over the  scientific  requirements, opting to remain dedicated to time instead moving along without much care for procedure.
I m not sure if this is just my own overly-focused nitpicking or something I shouldn t be concerned with when looking at the overall experience, considering it has an epic story to span starting with establishing the dusty world on Earth before venturing into space.
I m looking forward to taking a second look and giving it another shot without any expectations, hoping that I m able to appreciate the spectacle and story overall.
Even though I know where it ends, I m unquestionably excited to go back for another ride.
Take me through the wormhole again.
The Abyss, Sunshine, Mission to Mars, Solaris  it even has some Rendezvous with Rama in it .
But unlike other films such as Oblivion  which was too obviously inspired , Nolan borrows and then re-imagines in a way that is fresh and exciting, and feels more like a nod than a direct copy.
He takes the bigger ideas and themes behind these films, in addition to some of the key moments, and puts his own twist on them, wrapping everything around the bigger story of love and human connection.
It works.
It never ventures towards boring when so much of it jaw-dropping to watch, when so much of it is thrilling and captivating and powerful and exciting  especially when projected in 70mm on a huge IMAX screen - the way this movie is truly meant to be seen .
Speaking of, one of the other invigorating powers of Interstellar is how much it can inspire us to dream through the visuals alone.
I ve already seen comments saying that one shot during the wormhole sequence or while Endurance is traveling near Saturn put the size and scale of space–us against this universe–into perspective in a way this viewer had never experienced before.
Of course, Nolan s spectacle is the reason I love him already, but seeing him go wild bringing us the awesome splendor of space in 70mm IMAX is indeed jaw-dropping.
There are a few times I wish the camera would keep rolling like in Gravity, but it cuts between 70mm and 35mm giving it a cinematic feel for dialogue and human moments, and a magnificent experience when it expands into 70mm.
This movie is what movie theaters are made for, and Nolan knows that, utilizing every inch of the screen with sound & music that will rattle your bones and make you smile.
The best films are the ones that stir up discussion, that make people of all ages debate and consider what it all means, where these ideas even come from to begin with, and how they pertain to our reality not just the characters on screen.
The power of Interstellar is in its ability to create and encourage discussion about the universe we re in, and other ambitious topics like our place in the universe, how science can enable us to progress forward as the human race  beyond planet Earth , and how it might involve something more than science to pull that off.
What s out there waiting for us?
And when we find whatever is waiting out there, will we know what to make of it?
How does it affect us as humans?
These are a few questions the movie poses.
In the 24 hours since first screening Interstellar, I ve already had at least two if not three passionate debates with friends about the movie and key parts of its plot.
They aren t just discussions about the merits of the movie, but theories about what means what, what the Nolans were going for  Jonathan Nolan originally wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg, eventually rewriting it with his brother Christopher Nolan .
Just thinking about the possibilities of what s hinted at in this movie kicked my brain into overdrive trying to process the gargantuan ideas so boldly explored and woven into the fabric of this adventure across galaxies.
It s as exciting and emotional to think about as it is to watch   similar to Gone Girl  , and that s always an achievement.
I m looking forward to the discussions this movie starts much more than the criticisms it will undoubtedly receive.
It s the theories, not the complaints, that will be the most eye-opening after release.
When it really comes down to it, the cinematic experience and the emotions it elicits are the most important in informing my own response to a movie.
Interstellar may not be completely flawless, but in the end that just doesn t matter, because it s science fiction cinema on the grandest of scales that explores our hopes and dreams as humans in an emotionally affecting yet awe-inspiring way.
It is capable of showing us, through love, through hope, that we can look up at the stars again and dream about exploring the cosmos the way we used to.
Nolan has reached deep to show us it s still possible to push humanity farther than we ve ever been, while never forgetting where we came from as we look beyond this tiny planet that, for now, we call home.
We mean to be a part of it—we mean to lead it.
For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace.

Great review, Alex.
David Gyasi is the other astronaut  Romilly  though, not David Oyelowo.
My favorite part about reviews of films like Interstellar is when critics assume no one looks up at the stars and dreams anymore.
Using it as a broad statement to inject gravitas into the current creative climate.
No no, I don t assume that.
I state in the review:  It s not that we don t already wonder .
It s not that we don t dream, it s just that on a whole general interest in the stars has fallen off for interest in other things.
Compare nowadays to the 1960s during the Space Race, and how excited every person on the planet was to launch into space.
Nowadays we don t even have Space Shuttles anymore.
It s a generalized statement, sure, but it is accurate nonetheless.
Perhaps what rubbed me the wrong way was that it s the opening sentence.
But that might be my own personal preference peeking through.
I agree with the priority shift, as if as a society we ve  been there, done that .
Which is a bizarre notion, especially when a small piece of technology such as a phone can launch us into a speculative trajectory as to how the future will change with it in our possession.
Yet the wonders of space exploration aren t  sexy  anymore.
Might be our desire to look big, instead of small.
The unknown is frightening and the trend of our attention seems to be on things we can confront physically.
Didn t mean to come off as dismissive, and perhaps my own assumption was obtuse.
Either way, thanks for a level headed response.
Cheers.
Of course, no problem.
I appreciate the honest response, this is the kind of discussion I m hoping the movie starts.
Maybe even talking about the shift in interest is exactly what is needed to make more people join with those who still are looking up and dreaming.
Didn t they debunk most of the science in Gravity?
5 10.
But I prefer to have people read my thoughts in full and not just sit there looking for a grade and using that only as final judgment.
A movie is more than just a grade.
So you think Cloud Atlas, which you gave a 10 10, is a better movie than Interstellar?
I often think reviews grades should express how well the movie achieved what it set out to achieve rather than being a measure of how good movies are comparatively.
For instance Guardians of the Galaxy got 10 10  i think .
Does that mean it is a better film that Interstellar?
Not necessarily, but I would say GotG did what it set out to perfectly.
Where maybe Interstellar is just a little clunky at points.
Just my two cents.
It s usually the films that are so hyped up  like Interstellar, Avatar, Cloud Atlas etc  that ends up being mixed or falls short of expectations.
Regardless if the critic liked it or not, I think some critics would still give it high praise because of the Nolan brand on it.
After reading FS s review on it, I feel as if the author had mixed feelings to it.
He raved about Cloud Atlas in that review, but in this review he seemed more humble in his choice of words.
I don t know if his reviewing style has changed over the years or it could just be the nature of this film, who knows.
Reading some other reviews about the movie have also been somewhat mixed.
It s too early to tell.
My bar is set to Inception.
If Interstellar is just as entertaining and interesting on that level, or even higher, then I would say Nolan succeeded and continues his streak on making original stories that Hollywood needs to do more of.
If it doesn t, then it s just another hyped film.
That s my two cents.
I m glad to hear it s got some heart.
I felt like that s the main thing Inception lacked.
Can t wait to see it.
I don t know why but I think you are little disappointed, it s not what you expected and certainly no inception.
But hey who am I!
Because Inception was so good?
Personally, I like that his review isn t full of hype.
Nolan is good but hes no Spielberg or Scorsese yet.
I still think that the Prestige is still his best film.
Im not into Batman and really did not care for both sequels.
Im hoping that i will like Interstellar more than the Prestige.
I look forward to being amazed by Christopher Nolan yet once again.
Sit back, relax and let your imagination take you away for 3 hours.
Masterful review.
You reviewed this with zero spoilers but it was still thorough and insightful.
Seemed objective, highlights and low lights were both addressed.
Regardless, I ll be watching this as soon as I can!
That s all I ll say for now.
It is time.
Nolan is unstoppable.
Thanks for the review AB.

With Christopher Nolan’s forthcoming film Interstellar, the director of The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception boldly goes into outer space with his most visually spectacular and emotionally resonant movie yet.
We can say that because we’ve seen it.
We also watched Nolan make it, and in this week’s Entertainment Weekly, we bring you onto the top secret set and take you into editing room to chronicle how the man who made Batman fly to new heights pushed himself creatively and personally to produce his sci-fi epic.
Interstellar opens Nov.
5 and stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, and John Lithgow, to name a few.
The plot tracks a quartet of astronauts and scientists—and the most unusual robot to grace the screen in years  meet the fall’s breakout star: a mini-monolith of metamorphic Jenga blocks named TARS —who journey across the universe to search for a new home for mankind: In the near future of the film, Earth is dying, ravaged by blight and environmental ruin.
And yet, Interstellar deliberately veers away from dystopia chic with its depiction of optimistic, adventurous heroism reminiscent of director Philip Kaufmann’s adaptation of The Right Stuff, which not only influenced the tone of Nolan’s movie but the techniques he used to make it.
Informed by the work and theories of renowned astrophysicist Kip Thorne, Interstellar is more akin to the speculative sci-fi of 2001: A Space Odyssey than space opera fantasy like Star Wars, while still remaining accessible pop entertainment.
Mind altering substances are not required to appreciate this trip.
Hathaway with a laugh.
Nolan challenged himself and his team to fill Interstellar with imagery designed to inspire awe in the audience, not to mention a little terror.
Dust storms.
Tidal waves.
Wormholes.
A tiny, fragile spaceship juxtaposed against the monstrous gas planet of Saturn.
Everything in the hush-hush final act.
This is the first film I have made where the actual experience of the film is paramount to the audience,” Nolan tells EW.
You would think that’s the case with Batman movies but it’s not; they’re more dependent on the reaction of characters on screen.
Interstellar is different.
Nolan also aspired to craft a philosophically thoughtful, deep feeling experience, too.
He chased that goal in a number of ways, from an inventive collaboration with composer Hans Zimmer to drawing inspiration from his experience as a father.
The film is about human nature, what it means to be human.
It sounds like a very grand statement, but I don’t intend it to be.
I mean it in the way, say, Treasure of the Sierra Madre is about dramatizing ideas of human nature,” says Nolan, who wrote the script with his brother, Jonathan, and produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, who has produced all of his movies.
When you take an audience far away from human experience as possible, you wind up focusing very tightly on human nature and how we are connected to each other.
The result is Nolan’s most personal movie.
Nobody is able to put more scope, scale, awe on screen than Chris,” says McConaughey.
But I think he was wanting to take the next step, toward something more intimate.

Even the most well respected filmmakers have been known to bend the truth a bit when it comes to depicting science on the silver screen, throwing accuracy to the wind in favor of trivialities like  plot  and  drama.  We kid, of course.
But how does this fall s sci-fi epic Interstellar from director Christopher Nolan hold up under a microscope  no pun intended ?
The folks at Popular Science have taken the Dark Knight helmsman s latest to task, exploring the feasibility of traveling through wormholes, the type of spaceship we d need for humanity to travel  round the stars and a few other concepts explored in the film.
The research was based off of existing trailers, and more to the point, PopSci says that Interstellar s real-world theoretical physicist flat-out refused to speak with its writers.
So, if you re on total media blackout for fear of spoilers, this might not ruin aspects of the flick for you.
Are you lucky enough to live somewhere close to a 70mm IMAX screening of the movie in a few weeks?

One of the most intriguing aspects of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar is that every time we see a new piece of marketing for the film, we end up with more questions than answers.
Such savvy campaigning led us to select Interstellar as our third most anticipated movie of the fall , along with the fact it’s Nolan’s follow-up to the Dark Knight trilogy, starring Matthew McConaughey, in his first film of 2014, after owning 2013.
But after seeing our exclusive IMAX poster above, we may have to bump it up a spot or two.
Today’s poster continues the film’s pattern of mysterious marketing, yet again providing more questions than answers.
Where exactly are McConaughey and his fellow astronauts  presumably Wes Bentley and Anne Hathaway ?
Is that fresh water they’re wading in?
The kind life needs to survive?
Are there alien sharks they should be worried about?
Shall we assume this is one of those worlds?
And is this before or after the biggest wave ever imagined seems to swallow up the spaceship displayed in the poster?

Kip Thorne’s concept for a black hole in Interstellar.
While he was working on the film Interstellar, executive producer Kip Thorne was tasked with creating the black hole that would be central to the plot.
As a theoretical physicist, he also wanted to create something that was truly realistic and as close to the real thing as movie-goers would ever see.
On the other hand, Christopher Nolan – the film’s director – wanted to create something that would be a visually-mesmerizing experience.
As you can see from the image above, they certainly succeeded as far as the aesthetics were concerned.
But even more impressive was how the creation of this fictitious black hole led to an actual scientific discovery.
In short, in order to accurately create a visual for the story’s black hole, Kip Thorne produced an entirely new set of equations which guided the special effects team’s rendering software.
The end result was a visual representation that accurately depicts what a wormhole black hole would look like in space.
Artist’s conception of the event horizon of a black hole.
This was no easy task, since black holes  as the name suggests  suck in all light around them, warp space and time, and are invisible to all but X-ray telescopes  due to the bursts of energy they periodically emit .
But after a year of work by 30 people and thousands of computers, Thorne and the movie’s special effects team managed to create something entirely realistic.
Relying entirely on known scientific principles, the black hole appears to spin at nearly the speed of light, dragging bits of the universe along with it.
Based on the idea that it was once a star that collapsed into a singularity, the hole forms a glowing ring that orbits around a spheroidal maelstrom of light, which seems to curve over the top and under the bottom simultaneously.
To simulate the accretion disk, the special effects team generated a flat, multicolored ring and positioned it around their spinning black hole.
Then something very weird and inspiring happened.
Thorne’s diagram of how a black hole distorts light.
We found that warping space around the black hole also warps the accretion disk,” explained Paul Franklin, a senior supervisor of Academy Award-winning effects house Double Negative.
The Double Negative team thought it must be a bug in the renderer.
But Thorne realized that they had correctly modeled a phenomenon inherent in the math he’d supplied.
This is our observational data,” he said of the movie’s visualizations.
That’s the way nature behaves.
Thorne also stated that he thinks he can get at least two published articles out of it.
But more important than that is the fact that Thorne, a thoroughgoing scientist and lover of the mysteries of space and physics, has a chance to show a mass audience some real, accurate science.
The movie premiers in North America on November 7th.
Christopher Nolan and Kip Thorne explain the science behind creating the movie’s black hole.

Nice article.
Just to clarify: visualizations of accretion disks around black holes have been properly visualized since the early work of Cunningham & Bardeen, in 1972 1973 or Luminet 1979.
Thomas Mueller.
I don’t agree with the white fuzz… I believe we should be seeing a set of airy discs, concentric rings surrounding the singularity, each disc with its own chromatic aberration and so… circular rainbows.
As a ship accelerates towards a singularity, the closest discs should phase blue, so depending on both the Fraunhofer angles and the relative velocities, this shifting would tell us both the off axis and the speed differential.
So no, I don’t agree with the white fuzz.
Really?
Oy!
The title also calls the movie “Intellstellar”.
Looks like it was written in a hurry.
LOL Science?
To begin with wormholes at the center of a spinning black hole are a convenience theory for interstellar space travel.
Just because the mathematics says its possible doesn’t make it so.
To state something is mathematically sound is no different than stating a sentence is grammatically sound.
I’m kind of puzzled.
Perhaps I misunderstand what you are saying?
There is a LOT of observational data which strongly supports the existence of black holes.
Rejection of the idea of black holes would require invocation of either some other object which would likely have to be stranger than a black hole, or a pretty wholesale rejection of our knowledge of Physics.
There is a lot of cosmology which is on rather shaky grounds, the existence of black holes is on surprisingly firm ground.
I should point out that wormholes are, of course, not at all on firm grounds if that was the only point you were making.
You’re wrong and what is absolutely hilarious and horribly sad at the same time is the fact that you are completely unable to recognize how wrong you are because you’ve been totally sold by the pseudo-physicists that are occupying the upper reaches of modern academia in particle physics, gravitational physics, astrophysics and cosmology.
Black holes are now and always have been an intellectual fiction.
To understand what the pseudo-scientists in academia are calling ‘black holes’ would require a wholesale rejection of much of our knowledge of modern physics; not all… but quite a bit.
First you have to learn what is true.
But I can tell you one thing that is taught that is not true at all.
Elementary charged particles don’t always repel each other if they have the same charge and they don’t always attract each other if they have the opposite charge.
They only obey Coulomb’s Law when they are not overlapping in the same momentum space.
Being in the same momentum space or overlapping in the same momentum space is just a fancy way of saying that they are at rest or very nearly at rest with respect to each other.
So, if two deuterons  the nuclei of two deuterium atoms  have a common de Broglie wavelength  calculated from a center of momentum frame  that is equal to or greater than their inter-particle distance then they will behave opposite to the expectation of Coulomb’s Law.
This was only discovered recently  about two decades ago  but you won’t find it in any modern physics textbook.
Yet, it can be proven to be completely true using only one of Maxwell’s equations and literally mountains of well known and universally accepted experimental data concerning the attractive interaction of parallel current carrying wires.
People have looked at the interactive behavior of marco-scale objects like charged pith balls or charged balloons and then they concluded  quite erroneously  that because macro-scale objects like pith balls obeyed Coulomb’s Law then they could reverse-extrapolate that interactive behavior right down to the level of quantum scale objects like protons and electrons.
Yet, there is not a single experiment in all the history of science that elementary charged particles that are at rest with respect to each other will behave in accordance with Coulomb’s Law.
Not one.
Yet.
This one fundamental fact ought to bring down the entire house of modern physics but it doesn’t because it is universally ignored.
That one fact will show that black holes as they are presently conceived to come into being are absolute and total fictions.
Modern physics, especially the Standard Model of particle physics, is a house of cards.
Since cosmology and astrophysics is advised by particle physics … well, you guessed it … they are all houses of cards.
What is keeping them standing?
Ignorance and apathy.
They don’t know and they really don’t care … as long as they can keep the public believing that they are truly the experts then the money will continue to roll in.
They want you to conflate  that means mix up  the real science that is being done by material scientists and experimentalists that end up bringing you cell phones and 3D TV and all kind of wonderful modern conveniences and gadgets with the pseudo-science that they teach.
All they have to do is get you to think that they are the same.
The first group is to be praised for all of the great inventions that they are coming up with.
And you know what?
They are being very well paid by commercial interests to continue to do that sort of thing and to keep the inventions coming.
These people actually work for a living like most of you reading this do.
But the pseudo-scientists in academia who like to brag that they are theoretical physicists or quantum theorists or astrophysicists  who’ve never been to nor seen the inside of a star  or cosmologists ….
Remember that it was the technologist scientists who invent and build the telescopes that they use.
If you lined them all up against the wall and shot every last one of them, the world would be a better place.
First, it would put fear into the next generation so that they’d choose careers that are not just story telling and downright lying to the members of the paying public  that they think are all too stupid to refute what they are saying  but which actually correctly inform us about the universe we live in.
We don’t mind paying people to tell us entertaining lies when we turn on the TV or go to a movie; in fact, we expect that.
We should put the pseudo-scientists on notice right now that we want real science and not intellectual fictions and if they don’t start giving us real science then we’re going to put them all up against the wall and we won’t show them one bit of mercy.
My goodness, I’ve searched high and low for a publication of any sort that might be related to you.
Would you please steer me in the right direction?
With your insights I’m sure you’ve been published, even if it is in the National Equirer.
Black holes are intellectual fictions.
They certainly are not ‘scientific’ even if people  and the number of people doesn’t matter since real science is not consensus based ….
We might as well say that there are magical gnomes living on the moon and that the closer we get to one the more invisible do they become.
How nice to say that quarks can never be torn apart from their union into a particle such as a proton.
It is always convenient to give reasons why something that you believe exists cannot be observed and then call the whole thing ‘science’.
Science comes from the Latin ‘Scientia’ which means ‘to know’.
There is a difference between pseudo-knowledge  that’s what the people who claimed that they could see the Emperor’s New Clothes had  and actual knowledge like when you can observe the actual moon through a telescope.
It is amazing to me that people like Wheeler, Thorne and Misner can write a large book of speculations and it later becomes esteemed as actual science  actual knowledge  when it really is nothing but pseudo-knowledge.
Totally appropriate that this stuff is for science fiction.
By the way… lots of stuff taught in the highest reaches of modern academia today concerning astrophysics, particle physics and cosmology ….
Wow… so even the astrophysics community has to deal with “truthers”?
Mr.
Science Truther, please do tell us then what exactly are the super massive objects at the center of galaxies, along with why light mysteriously bends around objects that emit no light?
I can’t believe you’re suggesting executing scientists skyboltman99.
Tone down your rhetoric or find another place to share your views.
More common than you think!
Though they usually tend to be of a religious bent.
Andrew Schlafly of Conservapedia thinks they were invented to “sell magazines”.
It is always convenient to give reasons why something that you believe exists cannot be observed and then call the whole thing ‘science’.
And it’s even more convenient attacking vast areas of science as non-science without using a single scientific argument.
Of course, don’t be astonished if you get laughed out ot the room.
Always a pleasure to read posts by self-proclaimed scientific experts.
These semi-pseudo-quasi-faux scientists people attack everything and everyone associated with the perceived scientific “establishment”.
Einstein, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Heisenberg, Hawking, Feynman, Wheeler, Thorne, Witten, Bose, Penrose, Dirac, Et al, are all fair game.
It must be very difficult to carry all that additional weight with a head size almost too big to fit through a door.
Please continue to dazzle the community with these conspiracy like posts.
Westerners have this way of painting things black that don’t really understand.
They say that the scientific method has no place for religions, yet they still seek a ‘knowledge’ that is absolute, they still, quite rigorously try to find a truth that is absolute, one that exists all by its own – God.
Western world is quite good at solving problems, but they never arrive at the answers.
They find it not a fundamental error to use invalid concepts for validating others.
Take the definition of Zero for instance.
In western Maths it is defined as ‘nothing’  forgive my English , but they are quite contend of using a symbol to represent ‘nothingness’.
How is it possible?
How can you represent or present ‘nothingness’?
One cannot even grasp it… This brings me to my question, regarding the ‘Black Holes’.
If light does not escape a Black Hole, then accurate or valid, or reasonable, it is to use the color Black to paint its epicenter  for the lack of a better word ?
Well, pure black is an absence of light  there is no emission of any photons  rather than a ‘color’ per se, so it’s an accurate description of a singularity.
I really don’t see any problem here.
Why exactly should the symbol be imbued with the qualities of the thing it is representing?
You might as well complain about the existence of the word “nothing”, that’s essentially the same argument.
Words and symbols are conceptual pointers, not the things themselves they are pointing at.
And wrapping your head around the absence of a numerical value, or just the idea of absence in general isn’t quite as hard as you make it.
As for black holes, I suppose it would be more correct to label them as dark holes, or something else, but keep in mind the word “black” has more than one meaning here.
Sure, it can mean the presence of a color, black marker, black paint, black ink, but it is also used to describe the absence of light.
A black night, or a black sky, or a black room, doesn’t indicate that these things are covered in or filled with black paint or substance.
It means there is an absence of light here.
For these things, light is absent.
Seems like that works just fine as a descriptor for black holes.
And if you’re talking about painting or drawing a black hole…well, you’re no longer dealing with a real black hole, are you?
You’re dealing with a physical medium and pigments in order to create an artistic visual work meant to cognitively suggest something else.
Attempting to say that painting a black hole with black pigment is wrong makes as much sense as criticizing someone painting stars for not adding fusion to the canvas so it emits heat and light.
As for your note on religions…I’m not sure I’m following.
By definition  and as far as we can tell , any kind of religious happenstance, if it exists, defies science.
If God or religious beings or power is the only kind that can circumvent physics and natural laws, then they are supernatural, and above our ability to explain them in ways that can be modeled, replicated, or understood.
Trying to use science to support religion, or religion to support science, tends not to work too well.
Most religious things don’t tend to stick around long enough to be confirmed as existing, measured, and so forth.
They are in books, or ephemeral events.
Can’t really apply science to that.
What we do have are physical things, energetic things, stars, cosmic objects, things that can be detected, observed, and measured in different ways.
And from what we can observe, we can work toward a truth.
Will we always have a truth?
Will we ever arrive at a truth?
We may not.
And yeah, there’s some confusion and some hubris here that can cause some to jump the gun and declare we’ve already reached the truth.
But just because science can’t get us all the way there yet, just because science may not have the maturity in these areas to have the accuracy to grasp truth, doesn’t mean that it’s foolish or worthless to pursue it.
I guess I’m wondering what your alternative would be.
The highly anticipated Christopher Nolan film stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a former NASA test pilot who is asked to join the Lazarus mission and leave Earth behind to find a new life-sustaining planet for mankind.
The film also stars Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Michael Caine, David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Topher Grace, David Gyasi, Mackenzie Foy, Bill Irwin, Timothee Chalamet and Matt Damon.
Mysteries abound!
Do you want to know more about “Interstellar,” the year’s most mysterious movie?
Don’t we all.
Now, you can.
The site is pretty cool and interactive to boot, but perhaps the most pertinent information we can share with you is that the latest trailer for the movie, the one shown last weekend at Comic-Con that kind of exploded Twitter, is on the site.
Even getting into the site is something of a mystery.
To access it, you’ll need a special code: 7201969.
Interestingly enough, 7 20 1969 is the day that Apollo 11 landed on the moon.
A clue.
Interstellar” hits theaters November 7.
Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway also star.
Yes, another space drama — but Nolan’s film is on the other end of the universe from Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity.
The latter was an amusement park ride tinged with philosophy, a relative ditty.
Interstellar is the full orchestra performing a symphony.
The film is a travelogue following Cooper  McConaughey , an ex-test pilot who leaves behind his family to venture into a recently discovered wormhole.
The mission: Find a hospitable planet.
In Interstellar’s near future, Earth has given humanity the shrug emoticon.
Extinction is on the horizon.
The solution is an epic journey into the unknown.
Sandra Bullock averting zero G crisis has its own splendor.
Interstellar chews off more, for better and worse.
Interstellar is and needs to be two hours and 45 minutes long.
Like Inception, its acts—the earthbound drama, the space drama—feel like individual films, a trilogy in one package.
Only in 2014 do we have the technology to set a movie on the fringes of the universe where black holes swirl and theoretical physics run amok.
Relativity is a bitch — an hour spent on one alien planet could mean 23 years flying by back on Earth.
It’s a thrilling substitute for more mundane preoccupations that keep the rest of us distracted from the ones we love.
Time is always passing, Nolan tells us, and never the same way in two distinct places.
Interstellar acknowledges time as a human creation and a human problem.
The film’s lengthy runtime literalizes Cooper’s plight.
All he wants is to go home to his kids.
If Cosmos was the gateway drug , Interstellar is the hard stuff.
Interstellar is meticulously composed — the rotating vessel seen in silhouette against Saturn, vistas of watery nothingness on an oceanic planet, the unimaginable sights beyond a black hole’s event horizon — and yet it is still restrained, focused on the humans and their tiny place in the world.
Where practically achieved effects end and CG begins is a mystery.
Nolan’s spaceships look like the models they used in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Glowing planet surfaces look like Hubble snapshots.
So while the director finds majesty in the photoreal weirdness of a spacetime-warping wormhole, he does it without turning Interstellar into a over-pixelated Transformers sensory overload.
Set to Hans Zimmer’s Bach-styled score , it may prove a near-religious experience for planetarium regulars.
There s been much to-do surrounding the way Nolan shot and will exhibit Interstellar.
Major stretches of the film were captured in proper IMAX format, filling an entire frame with crisp imagery  even in the impossible darkness of space .
Smaller sequences were shot on 35mm, like every movie made before 1999.
Theaters equipped with the right projectors will show film prints of Interstellar.
Why should this tech-babble matter to you?
Because you want to see Interstellar on an IMAX with film projection.
The voluminous film demands the space.
And watching McConaughey s adventure explode into the IMAX format whenever it damn well pleases is as exhilarating as the action being captured on camera.
For those irked by the “little black boxes” of widescreen movies, this may not be the option for you.
For everyone else, it s the only way.
The McConaissance continues with a performance that doesn’t require much capital-A acting yet delivers every ounce of truth needed to sell its oddities.
Something’s always eating at Cooper.
On Earth, he can’t help but dream of his days as a pilot, barreling into the unknown.
When he’s on the mission, every passing second erodes his Hollywood physique.
Nolan tears the handsome, golden-boy McConaughey persona to bits with the film’s wrenching father-daughter story.
A scene where Cooper breaks down while watching logged messages from his kids, his son and daughter growing older before his eyes, grabs us with the gravitational pull of a black hole.
It’s powerful stuff.
If you’re not a sci-fi person, Interstellar may still be for you.
There are no cheesy “futuristic” flourishes nor a setup that’s all indebted to plot  “IN THE YEAR 2020 A METEOR CRASHED AND” — no, none of that .
Interstellar takes a lived-in approach to dystopia.
Cooper’s Earth isn’t far off from our own; Global conflicts wound down when societies depleted their resources.
Everyone eats corn because, well, that’s all that will grow.
Most people become farmers — a rigid testing system prevents most modern children from going to college.
When the Yankees show up to play at a neighborhood baseball field, you know things are bad.
Marvel, you can have your shared universes and menacing Thanos.
Interstellar is the rare action movie without any mustache-twirling evildoer.
The way Christopher and Jonah Nolan shade their characters, everyone is a hero and a villain.
Saving humanity takes sacrifices.
How far Cooper and his crew will go to complete the mission — or not — creates the friction.
Interstellar: 2014’s $150 million morality play.
A film this driven to say something, and on a mega-budgeted scale, will inevitably stir up talking head pundits questioning liberal Hollywood s agenda.
They won t be wrong to notice.
Nolan takes a hard stance in favor of science and exploration.
Interstellar damns government s mismanaged priorities on macro and individual levels, explicitly reckoning with the logic of climate change deniers.
One major character is basically the refusing-to-evacuate-Mount St.
Helen s guy.
The legacy of his farm, his commitment to the land he calls home, cements his world views, despite blight eating up crops and leaving his family malnourished.
It s not a total Midwestern slam — Nolan shows compassion and understanding for those who see science as a manipulation tactic.
He goes so far as to demonize the scientists he sides with.
But it s all loaded, ready to spark as soon as Interstellar plays for the partisan crowds.
There are times when Interstellar is too caught up in its own highfalutin sci-talk.
A stickler for details, Nolan becomes obsessive with unraveling all the knots in its string theories, the film’s bloated conclusion requiring 8 PhDs to understand.
Interstellar never indulges in eight-minute-long, Star Trek:The Motion Picture-like spaceship moneyshots, but it does find all the right angles to explain how the technology works, how a ship would dock into this rotating machine and blast off towards the system’s outer rim.
A scene where the crew enters the wormhole looks unlike anything committed to screen because it’s hard science realized by computer graphics for the first time.
The thoughtful approach to making a space movie makes 2001 an easy parallel for Interstellar.
More apt is Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
If Dad felt compelled to say goodbye to his family and take off into the night sky, where would he go?
Would he return?
There’s a tremendous amount of sap dripping off Interstellar.
Nolan’s filmography is light on tenderness.
Interstellar gives him a chance to rectify that.
The movie’s science may not hold up under intense scrutiny, but the tearjerking scenes will.
No talking computer can rival HAL 9000.
That doesn’t stop Interstellar from giving him a run for his money.
TARS, a prolonged mechanical slab of data-processing and sarcasm, is the movie’s greatest innovation.
He’s ridiculous and inventive, the wry Bill Irwin lending his voice for the automated companion.
TARS instantly joins Wilson from Cast Away as one of film’s great inanimate objects.

Christopher Nolan s epic new sci-fi film Interstellar has received measured acclaim from critics, who have praised its ambitious scale and effects but were less convinced about the story.
Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway play astronauts who must find a new planet to replace a dying Earth.
The Telegraph said the Inception and Batman director had come  agonisingly close to forging his masterpiece .
The Guardian said Interstellar was  a glorious spectacle but a slight drama .
The three-hour film  looks remarkable  but  sporadically sways into the absurd , the paper s critic Henry Barnes wrote.
Barnes declared.
The Telegraph s, Tim Robey marvelled at how Nolan had created  the most eerily beautiful vistas he s ever put on screen  and had tackled  all the big questions in one blockbuster package .
The $165m  £102m  film, which also stars Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine and Matt Damon, is  bound to be a front runner in this year s Oscar race  in the opinion of The Independent  s Geoffrey Macnab.
It makes last year s Oscar winner Gravity seem  like a chamber piece by comparison , he wrote, concluding it  verges on the preposterous at times but... still has a considerable emotional kick .
Scott Foundas, chief critic of Hollywood bible Variety , was fulsome in his praise, describing Interstellar as  an exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan s vast imagination .
The Hollywood Reporter  s Todd McCarthy, meanwhile, said the film was  never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that  and reactions would range  from the mesmeric to outright rejection for arguably hokey contrivances .
The Wrap  s Alonso Duralde said it showed  the very best and the very worst of Nolan as a writer-director .
The  stunning portrayal  of space travel was balanced out by  a third act of staggering wrongheadedness, along with female characters whose intellect takes a backseat to their exploding emotionalism and rage , he said.
Similarly, Indie Wire  s James Rocchi judged it to be  a confused mix of daringly unique space-travel footage like you ve never seen and droningly familiar emotional and plot beats that you ve seen all too many times before .
But maybe that s not what you go to a space opera for?
Meanwhile, writing in the Daily Mail , Brian Viner said Nolan had made  an intellectually-stimulating sci-fi film , although he  felt at times during Interstellar that he might have boldly gone for a stimulus too far .
There were moments when I wished I d brushed up beforehand on my quantum physics.
Interstellar is released on 7 November.

KSP Interstellar is a plugin for Kerbal Space Program, designed to encourage bootstrapping toward ever more advanced levels of technology as well as utilising In-Situ resources to expand the reach of Kerbal civilisation.
Players will first gain access to contemporary technologies that have not been widely applied to real space programs such as nuclear reactors, electrical generators and thermal rockets.
By continuing down the tech tree and performing more research, these parts can be upgraded and later surpassed by novel new technologies such as fusion and even antimatter power.
We attempt to portray both the tremendous power of these technologies as well as their drawbacks, including the tremendous difficulty of obtaining resources like antimatter and the difficulties associated with storing it safely.
The goal being to reward players who develop advanced infrastructure on other planets with new, novel and powerful technologies capable of helping Kerbals explore planets in new and exciting ways.
The principal goal of KSP Interstellar is to expand Kerbal Space Program with interesting technologies and to provide a logical and compelling technological progression beginning with technologies that could have been available in the 1970s 1980s, then technologies that could be available within the next few years, progressing to technologies that may not be available for many decades, all the way out to speculative technologies that are physically reasonably but may or may not ever be realisable in practise.
Before I go any further, I d like to shout out a huge thank you to ZZZ, who has provided almost all of the amazing art found in this plugin.
I m not sure this plugin would have reached near this level of popularity without your excellent work.
Problem?
Maybe the FAQ can give an instant response!
Notes on use: You will not be able to use the advanced technology in this plugin right out of the box.
You need to send an antimatter collector  or several  into the magnetosphere of a planet  look for the biggest particle flux you can find  and use it to fill antimatter storage tanks or upgrade nuclear generators and reactors.
It s possible to achieve some amazingly powerful effects in this plugin but you do have to put in some effort to get access to them.
I hope you enjoy it!
Finally, if you d like to donate to my caffeine supplies to help fuel more sleepless nights spent doing this sort of thing, you re very welcome!

But can your alcubierre drive actually do what an alcubierre drive does?
But can your alcubierre drive actually do what an alcubierre drive does?
What do you mean exactly?
What do you mean exactly?
I think they want to know if it s really contracting space or just simulating the effects.
Also, negative mass.
In terms of game function it applies a temporary velocity change to your orbit which is reversed when you turn it off.
In this way the game correctly plots your trajectory at high speed but it still simulates the effect of an alcubierre drive correctly.
So, can this thing literally warp you to another planet without having to set Delta-V.
So, can this thing literally warp you to another planet without having to set Delta-V.
Correct.
The warp drives needs a certain amount of power depending upon how fast you want to go with it.
So, you can point your ship directly at another planet, click to activate the drive and it will instantly increase your velocity to the speed you have specified.
Whenever you wish, you may then click to disable the drive and it will restore your ship s original momentum.
It is often best to make one warp journey at high speed to get close to the target, turn it off, then switch down to the slowest speed for a final approach toward the target planet.

Once you arrive in the SOI of the destination planet you will then have to make a burn, which does consume delta-v  and often massive quantities of it  in order to enter orbit.
The warp drive is thus a great way of touring the solar system to see all the other planets very quickly but is definitely not a fuel efficient approach to getting from a stable orbit of planet A to a stable orbit of planet B.

We used to look up in the sky and wonder at our place in the stars.
In November, Christopher Nolenâ€™s movie â€œ Interstellar â€� will hit theaters and, last week, a very atmospheric teaser trailer has shown us what to expect.
Starring Matthew McConaughey, the film is set in a not-so-distant future Earth where it seems an ecological breakdown has ravaged our planet.
Amongst scenes of wildfires, choking dust storms and human suffering, personal family ties cause emotional turmoil for McConaughey as he is about to embark on a mission to save the world.
Amidst all the destruction, it appears that a wormhole has appeared in the cosmic neighborhood, creating a relativistic pathway to another part of the galaxy, offering something no other planet in the solar system can: potentially habitable worlds.
From the trailer, itâ€™s not clear whether the wormhole will be an escape route for humanity to settle elsewhere, or if one of these distant worlds holds a key to the reparation of Earth  though another trailer suggests the former , but we see McConaughey, co-star Ann Hathaway and their crew embark on a momentous voyage through the wormhole to save humanity, traveling through space and exploring alien landscapes.
The idea of a traversable wormhole opening up, providing a gateway to another part of the cosmos, is nothing new in science fiction.
But it seems that Nolen has recognized the public fascination with extrasolar planets â€” or  exoplanets  for short â€” that are being discovered at an accelerated rate by space observatories and ground-based telescopes.
Recently, the the science community and public alike were rocked by the discovery of Kepler-186f â€” an Earth-sized world orbiting a sun-like star only 500 light-years away.
This world orbits within its starâ€™s habitable zone, a region where the starâ€™s energy is not too hot or not too cold for liquid water to pool on its surface.
Liquid water, of course, is a key requirement for life as we know it to evolve, so any small habitable zone rocky world will be of particular scientific interest.
Although exciting, the possibility that one day we may visit this world seems unlikely, unless we have some space propulsion breakthrough in the future.
But by introducing a wormhole, Nolen has pulled a sci-fi trick to sidestep the problem of traversing vast interstellar distances to an alien planet.
Although wormholes come from the mathematics of Einsteinâ€™s general theory of relativity, there has yet to be any physical evidence of their existence, let alone whether they can be used to zip through two different locations in space and or time.
But thereâ€™s a catch; nothing larger than a photon would be able to make the trip.
This theoretical wormhole blockage neednâ€™t be the end of the story, however.
As we have little understanding of a wormholeâ€™s properties  let alone whether they actually exist , many different ideas as to their structure are out there.
One extreme hypothesis, for example, is the idea that our galaxyâ€™s central black hole may be the entrance to a wormhole and all supermassive black holes are somehow linked through these relativistic tunnels.
Whatâ€™s more, Chinese theorists have put forward a plan as to how this may be observationally tested .
Wormholes may be a hard-to-prove theoretical construct, but they do provide a wonderful shortcut for science fiction storylines to access the scientific reality of distant habitable zone worlds that exist in our galaxy.
Itâ€™s only a matter of time before we find a bona fide Earth-like world that has the potential to support life as we know it.
And when that time comes, weâ€™ll all wish we had a wormhole to get us there.
Interstellarâ€� is set for release on Nov.
6 in the UK and Nov.
7 in the US and, if Nolenâ€™s other movies are to go by , it will be a dark look into the future of mankind mixed with the hope that is spawned from looking out into the Cosmos as we ponder our place in the stars.

This exhilarating and intriguing spectacle promises to be one of the year s major cinematic events.
Travelling to the stars within a human lifetime via the known laws of physics requires energies millions of times more potent than a trip to Mars, for example.
In our energy hungry modern world the prospect seems fanciful, yet we are surrounded by energies and forces of comparable scale.
Materials are the bedrock upon which we can build starship designs.
Outside of science fiction, there is no use postulating a starship drive that requires materials that do not, or cannot, exist.

The twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft are exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before.
Continuing on their more-than-35-year journey since their 1977 launches, they each are much farther away from Earth and the sun than Pluto.
In August 2012, Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space, the region between stars, filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago.
Scientists hope to learn more about this region when Voyager 2, in the  heliosheath  -- the outermost layer of the heliosphere where the solar wind is slowed by the pressure of interstellar medium -- also reaches interstellar space.
Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their surroundings through the Deep Space Network, or DSN.
The primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn.
After making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on Jupiter s moon Io and intricacies of Saturn s rings -- the mission was extended.
Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets.
The adventurers  current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission  VIM , will explore the outermost edge of the Sun s domain.
And beyond.

When Matthew McConaughey was considering taking the role of a father and former astronaut in the science fiction movie “Interstellar,” he says he thought of his son Levi.
He was into space and I would explain things in the solar system and how we got on the moon and all these things, and  these young, wondrous eyes trying to, you know, work this out in his head,” McConaughey said.
The Oscar winner appears alongside fellow Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway and Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain in the Christopher Nolan film.
They all sat down for an interview recently with ABC News’ David Muir.
The film centers on a team of explorers that travels to another galaxy in search of another planet for humans to live on because Earth is in trouble over climate change.
The movie is due out Nov.
5 in select theaters and in wide release Nov.

Nolan said that he was drawn to the emotion of the script, which was originally written by his brother Jonathan Nolan.
My brother’s original script has this amazing set of characters at the heart of it.
This family who’s sort of tested in this extraordinary way,” he said.
Hathaway revealed that a particular scene during which her character cried had her hugging her castmates even more than usual.
I immediately wanted to go out and find a comedy to act in,” she said with a laugh.
Nolan and his crew turned to Kip Thorne, a renowned US theoretical physicist who has long studied the far reaches of the universe, for help on creating the black hole the astronauts travel through.
Nolan said parts of a spaceship were also built and used on the set, rather than a green screen or special effects.
If you look at this film and you look at where we are right now in the world — and the climate changes that’s happening … You have to push forward and evoke some kind of positive change in your life, in the world,” Chastain said.
She said she also hoped the movie would inspire younger generations.
The idea that there could be a 7-year-old kid and it inspires her or him to want to go into space and explore space, I think that’s incredible,” Chastain said.

Wired has a fun piece about physicist and black-hole guru Kip Thorne’s work on the film Interstellar , which comes out November 7.
We’ve known the premise of the film for a long time: Earth is a disaster, the human race is on the verge of extinction, and mankind must find a new home.
Alas, space is big.
It would take way too many human lifetimes to travel to our nearest possible second homes.
The only way to get there is through a wormhole—a spacetime tunnel linking two distant regions of the universe.
Wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges, are not the same as black holes.
Under normal circumstances, if you fall into a black hole it will crush you out of existence, not fling you to a distant corner of the universe.
But black holes behaving in various ways could, in theory, open up wormholes.
With Thorne’s guidance, apparently Nolan decided that a massive black hole  called Gargantua  spinning at nearly the speed of light would suffice.
What’s interesting is how much the black hole in Interstellar looks like the models that the scientists of the Event Horizon Telescope  EHT  have generated to study the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*.
The EHT is an international group of astronomers who are linking together a worldwide array of radio telescopes to observe black holes at event-horizon scales.
In other words, the black hole in Interstellar is really, truly what scientists expect real-life astrophysical black holes to look like.
Christopher Nolan’s black hole has higher production quality, but both images show the same thing: a glowing accretion disc orbiting the hole; a “shadow” feature caused by gravitational lensing; a thin ring marking the last photon orbit, in which light rays circle the hole many times before either escaping or falling in.
The EHT astronomers use their models to predict what their instrument, once it reaches full strength, might see—how Sagittarius A* should look when viewed from Earth by a worldwide array of millimeter-wave radio telescopes.
So when you watch Interstellar, keep this in mind: that black hole Matthew McConaughey flies through?
Scientists think the black hole at the center of our galaxy might look a lot like that.
And within the next couple of years radio astronomers might be able to take its picture.

I’m looking forward to the movie.
It will be interesting to see how they deal with the time it would take to reach the vicinity of a massive black hole.
The super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is something over 8 kiloparsecs away.
2 .
Looks to be a very interesting and entertaining movie as long as not too many liberties as taken with the data.
3 .
Odd title for something that has never been seen by man.
The effects caused by a blackhole have been seen, but the blackhole it’s self has not.
What is black Hole?
5 .
You can have two scenarios of a naked Black Hole  BH  drifting through space.
The common vision is that it has an accretion disc feeding it.
This would happen in cases where the BH has encountered a ‘point source’ of matter to digest.
If the matter is continually being drawn to the BH, from say a nearby star, the matter will stream along one pathway and as orbiting by the matter source takes place, a disc like what surrounds Saturn will develop.
The next case, a naked BH drifting through stellar barren space will attract matter from all directions.
In this case, a cloud of in-falling matter will surround the BH.
No force will act to compress the matter into a disc.
The matter will cloud like a nebula around the BH.
When two such BHs collide, they will look like the Homunculus Nebula of eta Carina, two solar system sized clouds coming together.
It saddens me when our mindful, gifted astrophysics society limits their concepts to a single possibility.
But then, clouds aren’t dramatic enough for Hollywood either.

1, 2014 – The mission of the  Interstellar  spaceship Endurance is clear — space exploration — at least based on its newly-revealed mission patch.
Paramount and Warner Bros.
Christopher Nolan s upcoming space adventure, in a new trailer released Wednesday  July 30 .
The two and a half minute preview builds upon the footage previously released in May.
Matthew McConaughey says at the start of the new trailer.
McConaughey, who as  Cooper  is an engineer-astronaut, is seen wearing a spacesuit on the Endurance alongside a similarly-outfitted  Brand   Anne Hathaway , a fellow crew mate.

Endurance mission patch on their right sleeve.
The  Interstellar  Endurance mission patch.
The trailer offers a fairly clear view of the Endurance patch — clearer than it provides of the movie s plot — but some fortunate fans got an even better look at the crew badge at the recent Comic-Con convention held in San Diego.
McConaughey and Nolan made a surprise appearance at the conclusion of Paramount s panel discussing its films.
The actor and director did not divulge much about the plot of  Interstellar,  but the movie studio had another surprise in store for the panel s audience, giving out the Endurance patches to them all.
The five-sided, blue, white and silver emblem features the  Interstellar  spaceship at its center.
The mission patch, which mimics the symbol-rich patches employed by NASA, is among a number of nods to real space exploration included in  Interstellar  and revealed in the new trailer.
Another is a rocket launch — perhaps the booster that Cooper rides to leave Earth — which exhibits structural features and markings reminiscent of the Apollo moon missions  Saturn V.
The Endurance mission patch can be seen on the right shoulder of Matthew McConaughey s spacesuit.
Cooper, Brand and their crew mates as they journey through a wormhole in search of  potentially habitable worlds,  is based on the gravity-field research by noted theoretical   physicist Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology  Caltech .
In addition to McConaughey and Hathaway,  Interstellar  stars Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine.
The film opens in theaters on Nov.

It s like a real treat to have a practical set to interact with.
But the movie, in theaters Nov.
5, is also grounded in the personal stories of the humans aboard.
As for acting in a spacesuit?
Both stars were up for the challenge.
McConaughey explained at a press conference earlier.
A real spacesuit s closer to 100.
So they did a lot of work on making it as light as possible.
It was easy to maneuver in.
Couldn t break out into a sprint, no.
Couldn t jump as high, no.
Iceland in a spacesuit on a glacier.
Hathaway decided the spacesuit  was my favorite costume I had ever worn   while noting that thanks to Nolan – who cast her as Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises – she s worn  some pretty spectacular ones  .

At last we got to see the full trailer for Chris Nolan s Insterstellar.
The drama seems centered around a worldwide food crisis fired by climate change and resource depletionâ€”a quite probable future.
The space travel part seems equally plausible, showing what may be the first realistic depiction of a real warp drive.
Of course, warp drives are not real.
But physicist have theorized about it and NASA has a small group of people working on them.
I m firmly in the camp of  if we can imagine it, we can build it.  But we will get to that later.
I completely buy the trailer s vision of a future weather and resource global crisis.
The global data is unquestionable.
Man-made or not, I don t care, the fact is that climate change is happening.
It s drastic and it s accelerating, and we may not be able to stop it at this point.
Computer simulations show that we are headed to a place where humanity hasn t been before.
The projections are so bad that the military have deemed it a national security threat already.
And trust me, the men and women of the Pentagon are not tree-hugging hippies.
As climate changes, everything changes.
We are already seeing the effects on agriculture, with ruined crops and food scarcity in many parts of the world.
Or better said, we are not seeing itâ€”people who live in third world countries are.
Our oceans  fisheries are also dwindling quickly, with many species on the verge of exhaustion.
Combine this with the millions of poor people getting out of poverty conditions in China, India, South America and Africa.
They are consuming more and more of resources that are already scarce.
More food.
More energy.
More oil.
More everything.
Even if the population doesn t go up, the demand will keep increasing at a fast rate.
It s not going to stop.
Still, I m an optimistic person who thinks that science may save us at the last minute.
Perhaps that s Nolan s thesisâ€”or perhaps it s the contrary.
We don t really know yet.
But I have no doubt that we are headed into this direction.
It s been reported that Nolan has been talking to astrophysicists and aerospace experts about it.
I m sure one of them has been Dr.
Harold  Sonny  White, at the Advanced Propulsion Theme Lead for the NASA Engineering Directorate.
Back in 2012 I wrote this article about his efforts, explaining why something like the type of travel portrayed in Interstellar may become a reality.
These are the words of Dr.
Harold  Sonny  White , the Advanced Propulsion Theme Lead for the NASA Engineering Directorate.
Dr.
White and his colleagues don t just believe a real life warp drive is theoretically possible; they ve already started the work to create one.
Yes.
A real warp drive, Scotty.
When it comes to space exploration, we are still cavemen.
We got to the Moon and sent some badass robot to Mars .
We also have those automatic doors that swoosh wide open when you get near them, but that s about it.
It s cool, but we are far from being the space civilization we ll need to become to survive for millennia.
With our current propulsion technologies, interstellar flight is impossible.
Even with experimental technology, like ion thrusters or a spaceship s aft pooping freaking nuclear explosions, it would require staggering amounts of fuel and mass to get to any nearby star.
And worse: it will require decadesâ€”centuries, evenâ€”to get there.
The trip will be meaningless for those left behind.
Only the ones going forward in search for a new star system would enjoy the result of the colossal effort.
It s just not practical.
So we need an alternative.
One that would allow us to travel extremely fast without breaking the laws of physics.
Or as Dr.
The answer lies precisely in those laws of physics.
Dr.
White and other physicists have found loopholes in some mathematical equationsâ€”loopholes that indicate that warping the space-time fabric is indeed possible.
Working at NASA Eagleworks â€”a skunkworks operation deep at NASA s Johnson Space Centerâ€”Dr.
White s team is trying to find proof of those loopholes.
They have  initiated an interferometer test bed that will try to generate and detect a microscopic instance of a little warp bubble  using an instrument called the White-Juday Warp Field Interferometer.
It may sound like a small thing now, but the implications of the research huge.
Although this is just a tiny instance of the phenomena, it will be existence proof for the idea of perturbing space time-a  Chicago pile  moment, as it were.
Recall that December of 1942 saw the first demonstration of a controlled nuclear reaction that generated a whopping half watt.
This existence proof was followed by the activation of a ~ four megawatt reactor in November of 1943.
Existence proof for the practical application of a scientific idea can be a tipping point for technology development.
By creating one of these warp bubbles, the spaceship s engine will compress the space ahead and expand the space behind, moving it to another place without actually moving, and carrying none of the adverse effects of other travel methods.
According to Dr.
There was only one problem with all this: where does the energy come from?
While we knew that warp drives were theoretically possible, physicists have always argued that they would require a ball of exotic matter the size of Jupiter to power it.
Clearly, that was not practical.
But thankfully, Dr.
White has found a solution that changes the game completely.
The Eagleworks team has discovered that the energy requirements are much lower than previously thought.
Ten c!
That s ten times the speed of light, people  remember, the ship itself would not go faster than the speed of light.
But effectively it will seem like it does .
That means that we would be able to visit Gliese 581g â€”a planet similar to Earth 20 light years away from our planetâ€”in two years.
Two years is nothing.
It took Magellan three years to circumnavigate around our home planetâ€”from August 1519 to September 1522.
A four year roundtrip to see a planet like Earth is completely doable.
And there are even closer destinations where we can send robots or astronauts.
The important thing is that there is now a door open to a different kind of exploration.
That, like Dr.
White says,  perhaps a Star Trek experience within our lifetime is not such a remote possibility.  We may be witnessing the very beginning of a new age of space exploration , one that would finally take us from our pale blue dot back to where we belong .
I don t know about you, but I m more excited than when Captain Kirk got his first unobtonanium underpants.
I keep reminding myself not to build up my expectations because I may get disappointed, but I can t.
This movie is going to be scary and exciting.
Scary because this future may be around the corner and we may not find a solution in time.
And exciting because this may be the first science fiction movie that shows interstellar travel in a plausible way.
How interstellar travel is part of the solution to our problems, I have no clue whatsoever.
We will have to wait to see.
We ve been excited about Christopher Nolan s new epic, Interstellar, for some time.
The Mars Curiosity has landedâ€”a phenomenal success that completes an incredible journey against all odds.
3 light years from Earth.
We reached the Moon in a tin can, built a humble space station, and have a plan to reach Mars in a bigger tin can.
The spacecraft was a long way from home.

Out of this world!
Anne Hathaway rocked some stunning star-embellished hand jewels to the world premiere of Interstellar on Oct.
26.
Chinese Theatre on Sunday, Oct.
26, with some truly out-of-this-world hand jewelry!
The Oscar winner, 31, seemed just as excited about the setting of the Christopher Nolan-directed film—a space odyssey—as we are, and she showed it by modeling a lavish James Banks Designs necklace and bracelet covered in gold, bronze, and silver stars.
The bauble dripped over the back of her hand, anchoring itself with rings on four of her five fingers.
But she wasn t the only glam gal on the carpet that night!
Her costar, Jessica Chastain , cozied up in a custom long-sleeved dress by Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy, with one peekaboo detail—an open back.
Her bombshell waves were tucked behind one ear revealing giant green earrings by Fred Leighton, a lovely contrast to her fiery hair hue.
The core of the film is a story about the powerful bonds of love and a story about a father and daughter,  Chastain, who plays Matthew McConaughey  s daughter in the film, told Us Weekly on the carpet.  Yes, I think  should expect incredible visuals in science and action, but maybe they might be surprised by a couple of tears that they have.
And speaking of Chastain s on-screen dad, McConaughey  in Dolce & Gabbana  was joined by his wife, Camila Alves, who chose a high-shine, strapless column dress by Rubin Singer for their high-profile date night.
As for the youngest star on the carpet, Mackenzie Foy, last seen as Kristen Stewart  s on-screen daughter, Renesmee, in Breaking Dawn: Part 2, looked adorable in a ballerina-inspired Marchesa dress and metallic sandals.
Who rocked the red carpet best at the Interstellar premiere?

Short of the one-sentence summary,  Group of astronauts travel through a wormhole,  little was known about Interstellar, Christopher Nolan s blockbuster sci-fi film.
Now, Warner Bros.
Paramount have released the first full-length trailer to the film, set for release November 7th.
The trailer juxtaposes images of dying crops and post-apocalyptic wastelands with celestial scenes of space travel, but ends leaving more questions than answers.
The clip focuses on protagonist Cooper  Matthew McConaughey , an engineer and pilot who must become an astronaut in order to save the Earth after the planet s dwindling food supply.
We must confront the reality that nothing in our solar system can help us,  says Michael Caine with typical gravitas.  We re not meant to save the world.
We re meant to leave it.
Details of that mission are still scarce, but Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, John Lithgow and Ellen Burstyn have all been confirmed to presumably help McConaughey save the planet.
Based on a script co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, Interstellar began shooting in August 2013 and was shot in Canada, Iceland and Los Angeles before wrapping up last December.
Nolan is notoriously tight-lipped when it comes to divulging secrets and reveals about his films before their release.
With the release of the first trailer, Interstellar shouldn t stray too far from the filmmaker s secretive game plan.

This morning I commuted to work through a wormhole.
I drove the interstellar-class spaceship Endurance – after kicking out the previous pilot, Matthew McConaughey.
This fantasy journey felt very real thanks to the Interstellar Oculus Rift experience, an immersive virtual reality trip that puts you inside the new Christopher Nolan film via an Oculus Rift headset .
Just like in the old days , the idea is that you wear goggles fitted with small screens showing a computer-generated world.
But now the technology has caught up with the concept, and when you turn your head to look around, the virtual world moves too.
Games such as Alien: Isolation become completely immersive, and by all accounts, terrifyingly real .
Earth.
I was able to look up, down and around at the interior of the ship surrounding me before a voice informed me that the artificial gravity would soon be switched off in preparation for entry to the wormhole.
There was a pneumatic jerk and suddenly I was unmoored, floating in space.
Although the trip doesn t feature McConaughey or any interactions with the crew, I did see evidence of them as their pens and notebooks drifted past.
I would have been happy to enjoy the pleasant feeling of bobbing along all day, but the experience is only 5 minutes long.
At its conclusion, my body seemed to drift into the pilot s seat, with a view of a monstrous swirling planet floating outside, and it was all I could do not to reach out for the ship s controls.
The voice over the intercom announced something like  prepare to enter the wormhole  and I tensed, waiting for the kind of Han-Solo-jump-to-hyperspace zoom we all know and love.
Then I was thrown towards a blinding white light – which is indeed what going through a worm hole is like , apparently.

Christopher Nolan s sci-fi epic  Interstellar  isn t in theaters for another two weeks; however, fans are already praising the movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway as the must-see film of the fall.
While there aren’t any written reviews yet, a select few have offered up quick thoughts on Nolan’s next film and reactions are overwhelmingly positive.
Screening for #Interstellar was great.
So proud of Chris.
Loved every image on the @IMAX screen.
I just told Christopher Nolan he redefined the way wormholes look.
Likely the last thing he wanted to hear—sorry!
Interstellar was amazing!
IMAX theatre.
Get ready for a new world.
Saw Interstellar last night - what a stunning, crazy film and emotional roller coaster.
Incredible pacing and sound throughout too.
Eric_Mabius I d say it s the best parts of 2001, Contact, Gravity with a pinch of Inception.
Am I allowed to say that  Interstellar  is incredible yet?
So did  Looper  director Rian Johnson.
Interstellar is bold & ballsy.
Huge ideas done in a concrete grounded way, and some of the finest space travel spectacle this side of 2001.
Page Six reported Paramount chief Brad Grey held a private screening of the film Sunday for a crowd that included Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Rock, Kevin Bacon, billionaire Ronald Perelman, and Dr.
Neil deGrasse Tyson.
More screenings have slowly been occuring since then.
Nov.
5 in 35mm and 70mm, and 70mm IMAX.
More than an hour of  Interstellar  was filmed in IMAX while Nolan also shot on 35mm anamorphic film.
It will be everywhere Nov.

We were all knocked out by the Frankie Rose and the Outs album in 2010; the effortlessness of its gorgeous girl-pop mantras, the intimate immensity of its Spector-esque walls of reverb, the beauty of a song sung sweetly over the most graceful two-chord vamps.
But are we ready for the new Frankie Rose?
Interstellar is a revelation, an album that floats free of its maker s history time spent with Vivian Girls, Dum Dum Girls and Crystal Stilts and offers the listener something strangely other, as alien as it is familiar, as compelling as it is enchanting.
Talking with Rose about the record, it s clear she was itching for a new start.
The first big indication: production by Le Chev, remixer supreme  for Lemonade, Narcisse, Passion Pit and Rose s own Candy   and ensemble member of Fischerspooner, etc.
I wanted to make a particular record and I knew Le Chev would be the one who could help me do it.
So, gone is reverb as the holy route to pop-grandeur, scaling a wall of teenage tears, and in its place is the confident swagger of a singer and auteur building the simplest of pop moves into aching, full-blown melodramas, grabbing hold of an emotion and riding its darker waves.
Had We Had It spins the sweetest sugar from chords that ascend into the firmament a heavenly, palatial blur.
Gospel   Grace rumbles with passion, a New Order-esque one-finger guitar figure leading the listener into the depths mapped by the chorus.
Apples for the Sun is breathtaking, with Rose singing out across a lone piano, before a glorious web of voice and organ pirouettes into the air, an arbor of pleasure connecting the verse with its instrumental shadow, a coda slowly slipping from view.
A lot of Interstellar seems to be about disappearing into, or finding and reveling in, this kind of imaginary zone, something Rose confirms: The whole record is about dreaming of some other place.
And as the audience drifts into the heartbreaking closer The Fall, which floats out to sea on a lunar-aquatic cello riff that s pure Arthur Russell, they re ready to conquer those other places, too, to let Rose guide them out of the album s spell and land them back in the sensual world, slightly altered, adrift and in awe.
If you re not familiar with Frankie Rose, let me fill you in: Brooklyn-based Frankie Rose was an original member of garage rock staples Crystal Stilts, Dum Dum Girls and Vivian Girls before going out on her own in 2009.
She released her first full length album under the name Frankie Rose and the Outs in 2010.
She s dropped the Outs, and Frankie Rose is now in.
Frankie Rose s new album Interstellar starts with title track  Interstellar .
It begins with ambient synths and Frankie singing in her best Elizabeth Fraser croon before the song kicks into an all out drum extravaganza, complete with reverbed guitar and thick analog synth strings.
Know Me  is up next with a heavy early 80s sound, a sound which plays a big part on this great new record.
Think Head on the Door-era Cure with Debbie Harry pushing Robert Smith off to the side.
It s a great track that ll make you long for Juno synths and Factory Records heyday.
Gospel Grace  is yet another tapestry of 80s nuggets, with heavy reverbed synths and drums, but with a very organic feel to it.
Daylight Sky  is a gem of a track.
If New Order, The Motels and Gary Numan had gotten together for a weekend recording session on the lower east side in 1981, it might ve sounded like this great song.
Pair of Wings  begins like a nuanced Zombies track with Dolores O Riordan taking vocal duties.
It s a gem of a song, slowly building with synths and timpani till it wavers off into an emotional coda.
With so many artists, the retro game can be a sink or swim sort of situation.
You can take the past and make it your own.
Put a new spin on an old record, if you will.
Or you can flail helplessly amongst vintage gear and out dated fashion.
Frankie Rose does the former with Interstellar.
She takes influences like Cocteau Twins, the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees and New Order and makes them into an artistic statement.
Frankie Rose has the perfect voice and songwriting chops to make this kind of record.
It s a love letter to 80s new wave and alternative.
Frankie Rose has stepped out of the garage and is ready for her close-up.
0 out of 5 stars dreamy, retro, special!
Interstellar has me feeling the way Antony Gonzalez  M83  or Jack Tatum  wild Nothing  did putting my prejudice against retro sounding music in a headlock, whilst delighting me with effervescent synths, warm, clean guitar tones, delicate drum machines and gossamer bass lines.
Frankie s music sounds great inspite of the fact that it s heavily influenced by 80 s synth dream pop.
The Title track has been compared to The Cure s Plainsong with the synth explosions being the obvious point of reference but i think it s more playful and less overtly epic sounding, pulling you in opposed to flooring you.
Know Me can t help be compared to the cocteau twins and the Sundays with the tender vocals, soothing guitar and light synths but it neatly sits along side those bands by pulling all these elements together seamlessly.
Night Swim and Daylight Sky s enticingly New Orderesque bass and synths also sound great with Frankie s dreamy voice other the top of them.
And there are even moments where this album sucessfully leaves 80 s town, take the satie like piano in Apple s For The Sun, or the amiina like ambience to the opening of air Of Wings.
For those already familiar wih frankie Rose s former endeavours this album may sound a little too smooth, considering the vivian Girls or the crytsal Stilts would seldomly be described as pretty, tender or inviting.
But even they d be hard pressed to deny that Frankie s transition to a more accessible sound isn t anytihng but a convincing one and if she has disappointed the riot grrrls and the indie punks she should rest assured that a whole new demographic of listeners is sure to take her to their hearts.
I can t say how much I love this album.
Perfect party atmosphere type music.
Doesn t interfere with having a good time; only enhances.
Frankie s voice is so ethereal and soothing that every song only helps to put you in a good mood.
Plays beautifully, have had no issues as of yet.
Her music is unique and other worldly.
Over all this is a Great Album!
I first heard Frankie Rose s Interstellar on UT Austin internet radio.
I bought the CD as soon as I could find it and am stunned by the amazing, easy, enjoyable music since.

What is the Interstellar Medium?
Simply put, the interstellar medium is the material which fills the space between the stars.
Many people imagine outer space to be a complete vacuum, devoid of any material.
Although the interstellar regions are more devoid of matter than any vacuum artificially created on earth, there is matter in space.
These regions have very low densities and consist mainly of gas  99%  and dust .
In total, approximately 15% of the visible matter in the Milky Way is composed of interstellar gas and dust.
Approximately 99% of the interstellar medium is composed of interstellar gas, and of its mass, about 75% is in the form of hydrogen  either molecular or atomic , with the remaining 25% as helium.
The interstellar gas consists partly of neutral atoms and molecules , as well as charged particles, such as ions and electrons .
This gas is extremely dilute, with an average density of about 1 atom per cubic centimeter.
Even though the interstellar gas is very dilute, the amount of matter adds up over the vast distances between the stars.
Hot ionized hydrogen near hot young stars.
The cold clouds of neutral or molecular hydrogen are the birthplace of new stars if they become gravitationally unstable and collapse.
The neutral and molecular forms emit radiation in the radio band of the electromagnetic spectrum .
The ionized hydrogen is produced when large amounts of ultraviolet radiation are released by hot newly-formed stars.
This radiation ionizes the surrounding clouds of gas.
Visible light is emitted when electrons recombine with the ionized hydrogen, which is seen as beautiful red colors of emission nebulae.
Examples of emission nebulae are the Trifid Nebula or the Orion Nebula  seen in this photograph .
Interstellar dust is not like the dust that you might find under your bed; it is made of very different substances.
These dust particles are extremely small, just a fraction of a micron across, which happens to be approximately the wavelength of blue light waves.
The particles are irregularly shaped, and are composed of silicates, carbon, ice, and or iron compounds.
When light from other stars passes through the dust, a few things can happen.
If the dust is thick enough, the light will be completely blocked, leading to dark areas.
These dark clouds are known as dark nebulae.
The Horsehead Nebula, seen to the left, is an example of this.
Light passing through a dust cloud may not be completely blocked, although all wavelengths of light passing through will be dimmed somewhat.
This phenomenon is known as extinction .
The extinction is caused by the light being scattered off of the dust particles out of our line of sight, preventing the light from reaching us.
The amount that the light is dimmed depends upon a few factors, including the thickness a nd density of the dust cloud, as well as the wavelength  color  of the light.
Because of the size of the dust particles, scattering of blue light is favored.
Therefore, less of the blue light reaches us, which means that the light that reaches us is more red than it would have been without the interstellar dust.
This effect is known as interstellar reddening .
This process is similar to those that make the sun red at sunset.
In turn, a dust cloud that is illuminated by star light, when viewed from the side, appears blue, as in the close-up of the  Egg Nebula  seen at right.
This is similar to the blue sky we see, which is produced by sunlight scattered by the Earth s atmosphere.

From wormhole highways to robotic space companions, scientific experts weigh in on Christopher Nolan s newest sci-fi blockbuster.
Asking a team of journalists to rally around a science fiction movie might sound ludicrous.
To us, science fiction is a lens through which we can explore our place and future in the universe.
So when we found out director Christopher Nolan was making Interstellar , we couldn’t resist.
The film promises to pull habitable alien worlds into reach, bring far-out spaceflight technologies within grasp, and test humanity’s mettle in spectacular fashion.
We wondered aloud: What if?
You won’t find any spoilers here; we have yet to see the movie, which stars Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey and debuts Nov.
7.
But in geeking out with experts over the limited information we extracted from the movie’s trailers  Nolan’s team, including theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, refused all interview requests , we rounded up the latest knowledge about wormhole travel, robotic companions, habitable exoplanets, and, of course, starships.
Without further navel-gazing, we present the science of Interstellar.
In this issue: Will your next best friend be a robot?
Plus: why thousands of people are ready to live--and die--on another planet; how we re building a better soldier; and superlice, coming to a scalp near you.
Welcome to Popular Science Blogs, a platform for some of the sharpest minds in science and technology to sound off about their areas of expertise.
Click the drop-down menu for a list of our bloggers.
Coming to an IMAX theater near you and everyone else, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar will have a record debut in the large-screen format.
According to The Hollywood Reporter , the space adventure is set for 770 IMAX engagements worldwide.
The film is scheduled for a wide release on November 7, but, as previously reported , it will screen two days early in 35mm, 70mm, and IMAX 70mm, so that film purists can spoil the ending for everyone else.
Foster also conveyed his support for a plan to release Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend, which will premiere simultaneously in IMAX theaters and on Netflix next year, circumventing traditional movie theaters .
IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond notes that he had to assuage some exhibitors’ concerns about the strategy.
Between this and digital-only theater owners’ ire about Interstellar premiering early on film, IMAX might not be the most well-liked format in the distribution game right now, but at least it’s still the most expensive for moviegoers.

The depressing answer in every study so far is that interstellar travel is centuries away.
He looks at the energy budget of interstellar missions.
We also know that amino acids are common in interstellar space.
There s this immense gap, as deep and dark as the interstellar night through which the cold wind blows.
The stunning space vistas and intimate moments with astronauts make for a fascinating flash of interstellar eye candy.
As you get outside the solar system, into interstellar space, particles become few and far between.
Galaxies grow as interstellar gases drawn in by gravity cool and condense to form new stars.
Gravitational tugs, orbital collisions, and interstellar jostles occasionally perturb an asteroid or comet onto a wayward path.
Elliptical galaxies contain many older stars, up to one trillion, but little dust and other interstellar matter.
Instead the interstellar cloud of dust and gas reflects light from nearby stars.

A new trailer for Christopher Nolan’s upcoming deep-space epic, Interstellar, was released Wednesday.
This new trailer offers more than sci-fi action scenes among the stars — the clip shows the movie’s soft side, focusing mainly on McConaughey’s relationship with his daughter, played by Twilight actor Mackenzie Foy.
Actors aside — Michael Caine returns with Hathaway — the trailer has an eerie resemblance to the Dark Knight trilogy.

Matthew McConaughey speaks during an interview with Reuters at an advanced screening of the film Interstellar in Fort Hood, Texas October 18, 2014.
KILLEEN Texas  Reuters  - Matthew McConaughey s upcoming film about a journey beyond the stars may as well be about the Texas actor s own stratospheric career these days.
From winning his best actor Oscar in March for  Dallas Buyers Club  to his lead role in the highly anticipated space-exploration drama  Interstellar,  set to become one of the year s biggest movies, McConaughey has rocketed to a level of stardom unlike anything he said he has ever experienced before.
And he loves it, the actor told Reuters.
Fort Hood Army base, a few hours away from his ranch in Central Texas.
McConaughey, 44, takes the lead in  Interstellar,  out in theaters on Nov.
McConaughey plays Cooper, a widowed father and former pilot grounded by his own circumstances, the defunding of space exploration, and other grim developments leading to Earth s fast-approaching demise.
Then Cooper is called upon to head deep into outer space to find a new galaxy for humanity to call home, but he faces leaving his family to pursue mankind s salvation.
And there s no return ticket,  McConaughey says.  That s a hell of a question.
Cooper s everyman status puts him in contrast to McConaughey s recent collection of antiheroes living on the fringe in movies like  Mud  and HBO s crime drama series  True Detective.  Playing homophobic AIDS sufferer Ron Woodroof in  Dallas Buyers Club  earned the actor a Golden Globe and Screen Actor s Guild award.
Once pigeonholed into playing goofy hotshot characters in action movies and romantic comedies, McConaughey s turn towards grittier dramatic roles has been dubbed the McConaissance, a change that he attributes to being more settled and mature in his personal life.
Oscar speech.
McConaughey is being drawn back to his lighter roots, saying he is currently conceptualizing his own comedy.
The actor said his most exciting and challenging role is being a father to his three young children with his Brazilian model wife, Camila Alves.
His decision to star in  Interstellar  was inspired by his oldest, 6-year-old Levi, who wants to invent a spacesuit that will let him walk on the sun.
I m really turned on with what I m doing day to day, in work and personally,  he said.  I m happy to be able to say that.

Welcome to The Multiverse, a new column where ll you ll find Ars  explorations and meditations on the world of science fiction.
The Multiverse covers things we love, the things we hate, and the things we do not yet understand from source materials new and old.
PLEASE NOTE: We’re going to speculate here about a movie that’s not out yet, gleaning information from the film’s two trailers and its Wikipedia page.
We’re not going to be spoiling anything on purpose, but if you want to avoid even inadvertent spoilers or strung-together clues, pull the ejection handle now.
This is your only warning!
I have a shameful admission that will probably cost me some geek cred: I disliked Christopher Nolan’s last film, The Dark Knight Rises.
It was a crowded mess of a movie, so enslaved by its own structure and so in love with its own plodding sense of foreboding spectacle that I found myself engrossed in Bejeweled on my phone as Bane was blowing up Gotham or whatever.
Even my wife, who’s normally so gung-ho about superhero movies, was bored.
We turned it off without finishing it.
And so the visceral reaction I had to the teaser trailer for Nolan’s upcoming Interstellar was totally unexpected.
Interstellar teaser.
The starting imagery is incongruous with the narration: a vista of lush crops gives way to dustbowl images from the Great Depression and burning fields as an unseen Matthew McConaughey narrates about overcoming the impossible.
After a moment we see images much more suited to the narration—Chuck Yeager’s Glamorous Glennis taking flight, followed by NASA launch footage and shots from within a Gemini capsule, and then footage from the Apollo and shuttle programs.
McConaughey sadly over a clip of shuttle Atlantis touching down at KSC for the final time.
We see McConaughey speeding away from a farmhouse in a pickup, and his soft voice offscreen accuses an equally offscreen audience of losing its way.
As the music swells, two figures in the foreground hold hands as a distant rocket lifts itself high over a field.
Who has forgotten?
Is it us, the actual movie audience, or is it the people of McConaughey’s country or world, wherever and whenever that is?
Enlarge   Atlantis and the final landing of the Space Shuttle program.
In mid-May, some questions were answered in the movie’s first trailer—we can now infer quite a bit about the film’s setting and first act, though the rest remains shrouded in mystery.
Interstellar trailer.
McConaughey’s character is named  Coop,  and he s a pilot and an engineer.
He has two children, including a plucky-looking redhead named  Murphy,  after  Murphy’s Law.  But McConaughey and his engineering and piloting isn’t what the world needs anymore—the world, we learn almost immediately, is starving.

Paramount Warner Bros.
Things begin to come together.
There is a plan.
Someone—possibly a government, or possibly a rogue research institution or something—has a working spacecraft, and they need McConaughey to fly it.
Following a tearful set of family goodbyes, McConaughey next appears suited up inside the spacecraft, which amidst soaring strings is shown first next to an enormous ringed gas giant and then approaching a warped and distorted lens-like phenomenon.
Wiki page .
As the ship skims closer to the distortion and huge swaths of sky flow beneath like churning white-water rapids made of suns, it becomes clear that this is what we’re seeing—this is a wormhole.
And at the music’s crescendo, the ship vanishes into it.
I’ve watched both trailers many times, and each time I shed a few tears.
The why is easy: exploration and discovery are deep and profound human drives.
With a modern audience, those drives are most directly tied to NASA and space travel, but the themes of leaving a home behind and flinging oneself into the unknown can be found in human literature and culture for just about as long as there’s been human literature and culture.
The best stories are the simplest, and behind the set and setting of Interstellar we find the outlines of an archetypical hero’s journey—at least, we see the outlines of its first act.
But the fact that we’ve seen this story before makes it no less compelling—in fact, in the face of a familiar beginning, the mind leaps to form connections and fill in blanks about what is to come.
There are strains of Odysseus woven through McConaughey’s Coop, just as Interstellar echoes strains of Homer’s Odyssey, though he leaves behind a daughter named Murphy instead of a son named Telemachus  in the leaked draft of the script floating around the Internet,  Murphy  is a boy, not a girl .
The dying, starving Earth needs an avatar for Coop to save, and what better avatar than his daughter?
Enlarge   Coop and Murph.
British accent:  We’re not meant to save the world,  he tells us.
It’s a freeing explanation.
The Earth of Interstellar cannot sustain us, and perhaps it does not even want us anymore.
We must go find a new home, and to do so we must leave the cradle and sail on that ocean of black above—a wine-dark sea infinitely more vast than Homer’s Aegean.
The journey will be of unknown length, and the chance of success isn’t addressed.
It’s implied heavily that as a species we’re doomed if we don’t try.
Enlarge   The tiny ship against a vast ringed world, like a mote in the eye of a god.
The trailers don’t offer much beyond that; they deal with only the movie’s first act.
However, the purpose of the trailers is to generate desire to see the movie, and these two masterfully pluck at the strings of our explorer hearts.
They latch onto one of the central facets of humanity—to go and see and find.
This drive to learn and know runs deep.
It might ultimately find its roots in the fact that every person living must eventually die, and regardless of whether or not one holds with religion and believes in an afterlife, death remains a veil to be lifted only at the end of life  to brutalize Shelley .
We ache to know that which we cannot know—it’s baked into our genetics, and we run toward the unknown from the moment we can first crawl under our own power, all as a proxy for our yearning to see behind that veil.
Of course, the globe-spanning information ecology we re building feels sometimes like it takes all the fun out of things—as the philosopher Hans Gruber once famously uttered,  When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.  The borders of our own world are pretty well known now.
Even hiking around in whatever woods are near where you live doesn t have the same sense of mystery it used to have before you could fire up Google Earth and see that they do in fact end.
We have little outlet for our desire to go and see—it s one of the things that makes movies and television popular.
But there are still vast oceans beneath us and boundless sky above—and those too are things we explore through computers and movies and TV.
You don t have to go far on the Web to see every photograph taken by all 12 human beings who walked on the moon , for example.
We can slake some of our desires to pierce that veil by gazing through NASA s lens into space, or through other agencies  lenses to peer underwater into the equally terrifying abyss there—but we still venerate those who actually go.
What child doesn t want to be an astronaut at some stage?
And if the average person now can consult Google and Wikipedia and whatnot, how much more do we envy the few who slip those damned surly bonds?
One of the most eloquent passages ever written about the undeniable, unswerving urge to explore was spoken by former President George W.
Bush at the memorial for the space shuttle Columbia’s crew.
This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose—it is a desire written in the human heart.
We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all creation.
We find the best among us, send them forth into unmapped darkness, and pray they will return.
They go in peace for all mankind, and all mankind is in their debt.
Behind the Interstellar teaser and trailer lurks the press of that desire—the need to see for ourselves and conquer the overwhelming, threatening, tantalizing unknown.
If we set aside the curiosity that drives us beyond horizons, we starve—spiritually and physically.
Even though it seems an easier path to turn inward, doing so lessens us.
It makes us small.
The trailer closes with the last ship sent by a dying people from a dying Earth vanishing into the unknown—a timeless picture in spite of the sci-fi trappings.
It takes a small amount of dramatic hammering to retrofit Tennyson’s  Ulysses  onto the journey.
In the small glimpse of Interstellar we’ve been shown, McConaughey’s Coop leaves his uncaring kingdom to his child, and though he may not be the driving force behind the mission to explore beyond the wormhole, he is its catalyst.
The man in the beginning of the trailer is wrong: a spiritually dead people who do not explore, cannot survive.
McConaughey’s ship with its mariners leaves the port of our solar system as the warp of space-time puffs their vessel’s sail; though instead of an aged king and his old companions setting out to again to find that which ultimately cannot be found, here it is the human race itself that is old and tired.
But there is still within a few of them desire, and will, and a yearning to go out there.
The end of Tennyson s poem’s dovetails with the trailer’s, and my heart leaps to know what happens next.
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
Interstellar comes to theaters on November 7, 2014.
