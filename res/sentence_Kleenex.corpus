This article is about the Kleenex brand.
For the band, see Kleenex  band  .
Often used as a genericized trademark , especially in the United States, the name Kleenex is a registered trademark of Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.
Such Kleenex brands include VIVA, Cottonelle and Huggies .
In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing  the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars.
A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the company s head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever .
The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief.
By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan “Don’t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket” and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant.
In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.
The original Kleenex trademark application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  was filed in the class of Medical, Beauty, & Agricultural Services by Cellucotton Products Company of Neenah, Wisconsin on Saturday, July 12, 1924.
Kimberly-Clark Corporation of Neenah , Wisconsin is the current registered owner of the Kleenex trademark.
In the USA, the Kleenex name has become, or as a legal matter nearly has become, genericized : the popularity of the product has led to the use of its name to refer to any facial tissue, regardless of the brand.

Companies place messages in trade publications targeted to journalists reminding them to include the ® when they re writing about products like Kleenex  sorry, Kleenex® , Botox  BOTOX® , and Tabasco  TABASCO® .
Herewith, a few notable examples of the quixotic pleas that have graced the pages of trade publications like the Columbia Journalism Review and the ABA Journal—reminders to the world that Botox is not  a generic term for botulinum toxin,  that  rollerblade  is not a verb, and that Kleenex is, on top of everything else, a  brand name that we ve worked so hard for all these years.
The KLEENEX® Brand promises to constantly innovate to consistently deliver superior product performance and premium quality.
Mizrahi will contribute to the style-focused Style Studio microsite for Kleenex, which is wrapped up with the celebration of the brand s 90th anniversary.

But Kleenex still lost a tenth of a share point as private label and a new value entry from Georgia-Pacific s Angel Soft gained ground.

Schiff zusammen mit der Sängerin Regula Sing die Band Kleenex und begannen in einem Bunker in Zürich ihre Instrumente zu erlernen.
Das erste Konzert von Kleenex fand am 29.
Mai 1978  spielten Kleenex zum ersten Mal in Viererbesetzung als reine Frauenband, was von nun an ihr Image in den Medien bestimmte.
Im September 1978 gingen Kleenex für zwei Tage ins Sunrise-Studio in Kirchberg , um eine Single mit vier Songs aufzunehmen, die Anfang November 1978 auf dem Schweizer Label Sunrise Records erschien.
Im November 1978 traten Kleenex zum ersten Mal mit einigen ihrer Songs im Schweizer Fernsehen auf.
Die UK-Tour bedeutete das Ende von Kleenex, da man sich danach in gegenseitigem Einvernehmen von der Sängerin Regula Sing trennte, mit der es schon seit längerem Differenzen gab.
November 1979 erreichte Klaudia Schiff dann ein Anwaltsschreiben, in dem der Band auch die künftige Verwendung des geschützten Markennamens Kleenex untersagt wurde.
Das Interview fand immer noch unter dem Namen Kleenex statt, da ein neuer Name noch nicht gefunden war.
Anfang Juli 1980 erschien dann auf dem englischen Rough Trade-Label die erste LiLiPUT-Single  Split Die Matrosen , die wieder im Sunrise-Studio in Kirchberg aufgenommen worden war und einen deutlich chaotischeren Sound bot als die alten Kleenex.
Die Musik hatte sich von der kantigen New Wave-Rhythmik der frühen Kleenex über den chaotischen Sound der 1980er LiLiPUT-Besetzung nunmehr weiterentwickelt zu leicht jazzig-improvisatorischem New Wave mit verspielten Weltmusik -Anklängen.
Sie veröffentlichte ihre Erinnerungen Ende 1986 in dem Buch  Kleenex LiLiPUT - Das Tagebuch der Gitarristin Marlene Marder , das immer noch erhältlich ist.

I want to start this off by thanking Kleenex for selling these in 36-packs.
I have three reasons for needing this much Kleenex, and their names are Liam, Samuel and Hank.
First the Kleenex disappears.
The other day my husband was watching me unload the groceries, and he asks me, all sweetness and light,  Honey, what re you doing with all that Kleenex?
So there s way more where that Kleenex review came from.
In 1924, the Kleenex brand of facial tissue was first introduced.
Early advertisements linked Kleenex to Hollywood makeup departments and sometimes included endorsements from movie stars   Helen Hayes and Jean Harlow   who used Kleenex to remove their theatrical make-up with cold cream.
By 1926, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the manufacturer of Kleenex, became intrigued by the number of letters from customers stating that they used their product as a disposable handkerchief.
Ads were run depicting the two main uses of Kleenex; either as a means to remove cold cream or as disposable handkerchief for blowing noses.
Results showed that 60% used Kleenex tissue for blowing their nose.
By 1930, Kimberly-Clark had changed the way they advertised Kleenex and sales doubled proving that the customer is always right.
In 1929, colored Kleenex tissue was introduced and a year later printed tissues.
In 1932, pocket packs of Kleenex were introduced.
That same year, the Kleenex company came up with the phrase,  The handkerchief you can throw away!
During World War Two, rations were placed on the production of paper products and the manufacturing of Kleenex tissues was limited.
In 1941, Kleenex MANSIZE tissues were launched, as indicated by the name this product was aimed at the male consumer.
In 1986, Kleenex atarted the  bless You  advertising campaign.
By the 00s , Kleenex is selling tissues in over 150 different countries.
In 1924, when Kleenex tissues were first introduced to the public they were intended to be used with cold cream to remove make up and  clean  the face.
The Kleen in Kleenex represented that  clean .
The word Kleenex is now commonly used to describe any soft facial tissue  see third photo .

It s called THE DIARY OF THE GUITARIST MARLENE MARDER, KLEENEX LILIPUT  which says it all .

The Kleenex Xperiments campaign asked middle school students to perform experiments using Kleenex tissues and posted the results online.
Just in time for back to school season, tissue brand Kleenex is demonstrating the strength of its product in Kleenex Xperiments, a campaign that asked science students to conduct experiments using Kleenex Everyday Tissues and filmed the results.
According to Kleenex, the brand reached out to more than 100 schools that excel in math and science and asked 10 to participate in the program.
These schools challenged their 4th to 8th grade students to use critical thinking to show how the brand s  thicker, more absorbent Kleenex Everyday Tissues  hold up against challenges like sneezes, nose blows, and runny noses.
The brand ultimately helped five of the 10 schools bring their experiments to life and captured the effort on video, which can be seen on the Kleenex Xperiments site .
According to Kleenex, the effort allows kids to see how Kleenex  can help keep the wet stuff off their hands  and inspires them to practice healthy tissue habits.
It also prominently features Kleenex Everyday Tissues, which the brand says are now 15 percent thicker and more absorbent.
In exchange for their participation, Kleenex says the 10 schools will receive $5,000 worth of Box Tops for Education, which they can use for textbooks, playground equipment, supplies, field trips, and classroom parties.

In 1924, the company came out with  Kleenex Kerchiefs, which were billed as the “Sanitary Cold Cream  Remover.
Ads  featured actors like Helen Hayes and Ronald Colman removing makeup the  “scientific way” with the Kleenex Kerchiefs.
That underground use grew even more rapidly when the  company started packaging Kleenex in the “Serv-a-Tissue,” the new pop-up  tissue box invented by Andrew Olsen.
Only in the early 1930s did Kimberly-Clark finally begin to market  Kleenex as disposable handkerchiefs.

Kleenex and Studiocom, the latter of which recently gave us the “Hand Washing Station” for the Kimberly-Clark brand, channeled this concept into their latest campaign, proving Kleenex’s added strength and absorbency with Kleenex Xperiments.
At Highland Oaks Middle School in Miami, FL the students piled egg yolks onto tissues, comparing Kleenex and “Brand X.
Brand X broke after 8 yolks, while Kleenex withstood the weight of 32 yolks.
It’s clear that the kids involved in these projects had fun being inventive, and  perhaps due to the brand’s selectivity  their experiments showcased Kleenex’s upgrade.
A good time was had by all, and I bet–at the very least–when these kids grow up to be parents, they’ll remember their results and buy Kleenex, not Brand X.

When it comes to softness, shapes and styles, only Kleenex Brand has it all.

Cannes, 18th June, 2013:  Mindshare, the global media agency network, has been awarded the Gold Media Lion in Cannes for Kimberly-Clark’s Kleenex Adaptive Marketing campaign in the UK.
By taking slow moving data on historical flu outbreaks, sourced from the NHS  the UK national healthcare service , and mixing it with fast moving data garnered from Google ad words auctions on keywords linked to illness such as ‘flu remedy’, Mindshare was able to adapt the media spend on the Kleenex winter flu campaign by geographic region in real time – only planning media where there was a live flu outbreak.
The name “Kleenex” is derived from the product’s intended purpose, to clean  Kleen-  up after autoerotic sex  -ex .
The sock was the standard post-masturbatory aid prior to the launch of Kleenex tissues.
Prior to the introduction of Kleenex, it was standard for a man to use a dirty sock or socks  preferably white so your mom can’t tell  to remove testicular wastes from bodies after wrestling with the tube snake.
This practice continues in impoverished areas of the world where Kleenex is not available or affordable, and is occasionally still used in developed countries in a pinch, and especially in a failure to pinch.
The history of Kleenex dates to 1945, when chronic masturbators Joe Kimberly and Bob Clark shared their mutual frustration with the use of the sock for cleaning up and began researching with paper products to meet the goal of developing a dry yet absorbent disposable wipe for clean-up which could be packaged for ready use and sold to their fellow man.
Experimenting on a 3:1 mayonnaise and water stand-in, they settled upon the material that they would later patent as Kleenex.
Launched in 1949, the first-generation Kleenex consisted of a single-ply tissue that could be easily dispensed from a box using one hand.
The latter feature was key to end-user satisfaction, in that a non-soiled hand could be used to reach for a waiting Kleenex tissue, while the soiled hand awaited cleansing.
Within one year, boxes of Kleenex tissues appeared in homes and college dormitories around the globe, generally located next to beds, toilets, TVs, and other places in the home where meat was most frequently beat.
Since the mid-1990s and the expansion of the pornography-choked internet, the Kleenex box has been found next to personal computers with increasing frequency.
By the late 1940s, women began to notice boxes of Kleenex tissue distributed stragetically around their homes.
In this act, women held a Kleenex tissue tightly below their noses to remove mucus from the nasal turbinates.
Despite the immediate global success of Kleenex, customers occasionally complained of the sheer number of Kleenex tissues and resulting labor that was required for their average post-masturbatory clean-up task.
Responding to this customer demand, Clark, head of R&D at the time, developed a manufacturing method which allowed two sheets of Kleenex tissue to lightly adhere together.
This event further drove demand for Kleenex, owing to the fact that like all new media technologies, the purpose of the VCR was to more easily provide pornography to the masses.
At this point in their history, Kimberly suggested development of a portable Kleenex packet “for the wanker on the go”.

The battle over the environment has found a new front: the inside of a Kleenex box.
Here s a little secret that Kimberly-Clark , the largest tissue maker in the world and parent company of Kleenex, does not want you to know.
The note found by a reporter purportedly came from Greenpeace and referred to its nearly three-year  Kleercut  campaign against the company, which has included disrupting Kleenex commercials as they were being taped in a public area and driving around in a truck shaped like a giant Kleenex box.
A reporter was able to slide a folded piece of paper underneath the perforated cardboard of an unopened box of Kleenex.
For the life of me, I guess I m struggling to figure out how anything, if you will, will get inside a Kleenex box,  he said.
