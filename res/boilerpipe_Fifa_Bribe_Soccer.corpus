ZURICH --  FIFA s bribery scandal spread Monday beyond allegations about the presidential election to include the selection of Qatar as the 2022 World Cup host, with evidence that FIFA s second in command suggested the desert nation had  bought  the right to host the world s biggest single-sport event.
Qatar s World Cup organizers swiftly denied the implication made in a private email from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.
Valcke said later Monday that by using the word  bought,  he meant Qatar was using the  financial strength  of an energy rich nation to lobby for backing, but he did not mean to claim any unethical behavior on its part.
Still, Valcke s message left the impression the World Cup was up for the highest bidder.
Valcke said in a statement about his email to FIFA vice president Jack Warner, who was provisionally suspended Sunday.
FIFA about the statement from their General Secretary.
The issue compounded the problems for FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who spoke publicly Monday for the first time since Warner and his former challenger Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar were suspended.
After years of dismissing claims of corruption, FIFA caved in Sunday, an extraordinary day in its 107-year history.
Warner and bin Hammam were suspended after an inquiry into allegations that Caribbean soccer leaders were paid $40,000 each to back bin Hammam s now-abandoned presidential bid.
At the same time, FIFA s ethics panel cleared Blatter of ignoring the alleged bribery plan, and left him as the sole candidate Wednesday for the biggest job in the world s most popular sport.
But the fallout from the two suspensions is clearly only just beginning.
Warner -- the suspended head of the 35-nation North, Central American and Caribbean  CONCACAF  regional body -- told British broadcaster Sky he would consult a Swiss judge about the legality of the suspension, even though FIFA statutes prohibit soccer officials from seeking verdicts at a national court.
Valcke confirmed Monday that he sent a private email hinting Qatar had  bought  the right to host the 2022 World Cup.
The email was made public by Warner just after he was suspended.
For MBH, I never understood why he was running,  Valcke told Warner in the email.  If really he thought he had a chance or just being an extreme way to express how much he does not like anymore JSB  Blatter .
It was a private email and we will discuss it.
You would have to ask Jerome Valcke what he was thinking,  he told the BBC when asked about the email s contents.  I don t know why he has said that.
CONCACAF was meeting Monday morning to plan a future without its president of 21 years.
Whistle-blowers and suspected bribe-takers gathered together as FIFA seeks more evidence in the next 30 days for the inquiry.
FIFA s gravest corruption crisis was sparked by a file of evidence submitted by Chuck Blazer, the American general secretary of CONCACAF and a longtime FIFA executive panel member.
Blazer told The Associated Press on Sunday there was  much more evidence  to come detailing what happened when bin Hammam and Warner arranged a May 10-11 election trip to meet 25 Caribbean Football Union members in Warner s native Trinidad.
FIFA s suspension of bin Hammam has been met with widespread anger in the Middle East.
Asian Football Confederation Vice President Yousuf al-Serkal, an ally of bin Hammam from neighboring United Arab Emirates, said he didn t believe the charges and saw them as a bid to remove him from the presidential race.
Serkal said.
Newspapers in Egypt were especially critical of the 75-year-old Blatter, who is seeking a fourth term as leader of world soccer s governing body.
The Al-Dustour daily said bin Hammam had  surrendered to the tyranny of Blatter.  Al-Gomhuria called the Swiss president a  sly fox who cannot be easily hunted  and compared him to Egypt s longtime president, Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted from office earlier this year.

German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer received a 90-day ban from scandal-plagued FIFA on Friday.
BRASILIA — German World Cup-winning player and coach Franz Beckenbauer was banned for 90 days by FIFA on Friday after failing to cooperate in a corruption inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Beckenbauer was part of the FIFA executive committee which voted to give the tournament to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, with the Qatari bid marred by allegations of vote buying.
S.
Michael Garcia is investigating the decisions on behalf of world soccer’s ruling body and is due to file his findings next month.
Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper reported that Beckenbauer’s former Exco colleague Mohamed Bin Hammam bribed fellow members to ensure Qatar would win the vote.
Bin Hammam has been banned from football for life over separate corruption allegations.
Qatar has denied any wrongdoing.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter has insisted only his ruling executive committee can change hosting decisions.
The evidence that could strip Qatar of the 2022 World Cup has landed at FIFA.
The governing body of world football said Friday it received three reports from ethics investigator Michael Garcia and his team after their year-long probe of alleged corruption in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests.
Qatar and Russia, the 2018 host, were chosen in December 2010 by FIFA s widely discredited executive committee.
FIFA didn t say if Garcia s 350-page report, drawing on 200,000 pages of evidence, has put Qatar s hosting rights into question.
FIFA said in a statement.
Garcia sought to interview all the FIFA board members involved in the 2018-2022 bid contests, though it is unclear how many cooperated.
Garcia and his investigation team met with officials from all nine bid candidates in a tour which started last October.
S.
Attorney — or the American bid, which lost to Qatar in a final round of voting.
Separate investigations on those bids were submitted by Cornel Borbely, a Swiss lawyer who is a deputy chairman on the ethics committee.
The reports, delayed since July, will now be examined by FIFA ethics judge Joachim Eckert, who can impose sanctions.
It is unclear if Eckert has authority to remove hosts or order re-votes.
Eckert, however, can seek follow-up interviews or  return the final report to  Garcia s  investigatory chamber for amendment or completion,  according to FIFA s code of ethics.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter has insisted only his ruling executive committee can change hosting decisions.
Eckert could apply sanctions against any of the nine bid candidates, their staffers or officials who were FIFA executive committee members in 2010.
Russia beat England and joint bids from Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium for the 2018 tournament.
Qatar beat the United States 14-8 in a final round after Australia, Japan and South Korea were eliminated.
Blatter has since acknowledged it was a mistake to run two contests at the same time because it invited collusion.
Within days of the vote, the integrity of Qatar s bid was in question from suggestions soccer could not be played in 40-degree desert heat of June and July.
FIFA has since begun consultations to switch the traditional World Cup dates to cooler months, with a November kickoff favoured.
Qatar has been the subject of more damaging allegations, often from British media and including whistleblowers claims, that it bought support and influence from FIFA voters.
Its World Cup organizing committee denies wrongdoing.
In 2010, Qatari official Mohamed bin Hammam was a key powerbroker on the FIFA board.
A former longtime Blatter ally, he was accused of bribing Caribbean voters during his failed bid for the FIFA presidency in 2011.
Bin Hammam won a legal fight to overturn a FIFA life ban in that case, but was expelled again in 2012 over financial management when he was Asian Football Confederation president.
Several voters in 2010 have since resigned from FIFA while under investigation for financial wrongdoing, and others have been subject to unproven allegations for seeking favors.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter, seen with the World Cup trophy in Brazil last week, is facing increasing pressure over the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
There is little doubt that FIFA would have wished for more positive headlines entering the latest staging of their showpiece event.
The 2014 World Cup has already proved one of the most problematic for soccer’s governing body, with delays over the building of stadiums and protests in Brazil about the way in which public money has been spent, distracting coverage from the potential action on the pitch and causing plenty of headaches at FIFA headquarters.
While events in Brazil will be the immediate concern, there is another issue that refuses to go away and threatens to cast a far bigger shadow over the organization.
The release of documents by Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper last week, detailing fresh allegations about bribes changing hands in order to secure Qatar the 2022 World Cup, has ramped up the controversy about the award of the competition to the small desert nation with little history of soccer.
Such accusations have been rife from the moment president Sepp Blatter announced Qatar as having won a vote among FIFA’s executive committee in December 2010.
The scrutiny has been such that FIFA, no stranger to allegations of impropriety, have even launched their own investigation, led by former New York attorney Michael Garcia.
His findings are set to be released next month, although, with the revelation that the Sunday Times’ findings will not be considered, there are fears of a whitewash.
From their base in Zurich, Switzerland, FIFA has thus far been allowed to run almost as a law unto themselves.
Such an attitude is perhaps understandable, given that there has been little to suggest FIFA’s flagship product has yet been tainted by a widespread suspicion about the activities of the organization.
Indeed, they will garner record profits from the World Cup in Brazil.
Going forward, however, there are growing signs that the pressure for meaningful action will prove telling.
Anyone in Brazil over the next month will not be able to move for paraphernalia promoting FIFA’s blue-chip sponsors.
5 billion over a four-year World Cup cycle.
While FIFA may be able to ignore the common fan in the stands or in front of television sets across the globe, in the knowledge that they will continue to absorb the product on the pitch regardless of the unsavory distractions off it, a threat to their sponsorship revenue will surely be taken seriously.
And such threats may be forthcoming, with several of FIFA’s sponsors voicing their concerns about the recent revelations.
Adidas, FIFA’s longest-serving sponsor.
Coca-Cola followed suit.
For the time being it remains a problem down the road.
Scrutiny over the Qatar World Cup in eight years’ time looks unlikely to do anything to turn people off the action in Brazil, which begins on Thursday.
1 million available.
Of those, just shy of 3 million had been sold, as of last Friday.
It may surprise many that, outside of host nation Brazil, the country to have brought most tickets is the United States.

ESPN is stepping up its coverage once more this time around.
More than 290 hours of original programming will be screened across ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC, including the broadcasting of all 64 matches live.
FOX Sports has backed on that interest growing.
In 2011, the network paid $400 million for English-language rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, more than four times the $100 million it took for ESPN to secure the 2010 and 2014 editions.

FIFA.
Although there has been no indication yet that the negative press regarding the Qatar World Cup bid, including the rights of workers’ building the infrastructure around the tournament, has impacted interest, the more long-sighted among FIFA’s members will be well aware of the risk of slowing the growth of the game.
FOX has already voiced its concerns about the idea that the Qatar World Cup will be moved to the winter in order to avoid the blazing-hot summer temperatures.
Having paid so much for summer programming, the idea of marketing the World Cup near the Winter Olympiocs and at the climax to the NFL season will not impress.

A customer watches a replay of a soccer game at Sony s showroom in Tokyo on Monday.
FIFA s Asian commercial partners, including Sony, said the same day that they expect a  thorough investigation  into corruption allegations over Qatar s 2022 World Cup bid, reflecting concerns that their multi-million dollar sponsorship deals might be tainted.
LONDON RIO, DE JANEIRO – Sponsors Adidas, Sony, Visa and Coca-Cola called on soccer’s rulers Sunday to deal thoroughly with allegations that bribery was used to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar, an issue overshadowing this week’s kickoff in Brazil.
With its showpiece event only four days away, soccer’s governing body FIFA is on the defensive, conducting an internal investigation into the decisions to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 Cup in Qatar.
Both countries have denied any wrongdoing.
The event is held every four years.
Qatar’s bid has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the Cup is played and the tiny country’s lack of domestic soccer tradition.
If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European club soccer clubs.
The signs of unease from some of FIFA’s paymasters will raise pressure on the body, led by its 78-year-old Swiss president Sepp Blatter, to get to the bottom of the allegations and tackle underlying concerns about how it is run.
The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,” said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970.
Coca-Cola concurred.
Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us,” a company statement read.
But we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee.
The FIFA World Cup is a platform that unites people all over the world, inspiring and celebrating the world’s most popular sport while creating memorable experiences for athletes and fans.
Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper has over the last two weekends printed what it says are leaked documents showing bribes were paid to secure the event for Qatar, which Qatar denies, while the New York Times has been running in-depth stories on match-fixing.
S.
Michael Garcia, leading FIFA’s internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after this year’s World Cup final.
FIFA issued a statement from the body’s marketing director Thierry Weil as it sought to take heat out of the situation.
We are in constant contact with our Commercial Affiliates including Adidas, Sony and Visa and they have 100 percent confidence in the investigation currently being conducted by FIFA’s independent Ethics Committee,” Weil said.
Credit card company Visa, which has a contract as a FIFA sponsor until 2022, said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation.
We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,” it said in a statement.
It is unusual for sponsors to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue and the comments reflect concern over the knock-on effects on their image.
This underlines that companies need to make sure that any high profile association enhances their reputation rather than damages it,” said Andy Sutherden, Global Head of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies.
4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from the sale of broadcasting rights and more than $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners.
Sony, Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola are among six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year.
Sony’s sponsorship agreement, which also included the 2010 World Cup, expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal.
Airline Emirates, whose sponsorship deal is also up for renewal at the end of the year, declined to comment.
South Korean carmaker Kia Motors Corp.

The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari, had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals.
Qatar denies Bin Hammam was connected to its bid for the Cup.
Bin Hammam has not commented.
FIFA has already banned Bin Hammam for life from soccer over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president.
That ban was overturned but another was imposed for conflicts of interest.
FIFA is now facing calls to strip Qatar of the World Cup should Garcia’s investigation prove that it bought the votes needed to host the tournament.
The United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea were the rivals who lost out to Qatar in the 2010 vote, and are all safer choices as former hosts of major sporting events, boasting developed markets for consumer brands.
S.
Fox, which paid an estimated $425 million for rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, was already unhappy with plans to switch the dates of the Qatar tournament to later in the calendar year when it would clash with the schedule for the National Football League.
Both fans and sponsors would be likely to cheer a switch to a different venue, although Qatar would be certain to mount a legal challenge to keep the Cup.
None of the sponsors would want it to be held in Qatar,” said David Peters, managing director of marketing company Dentsu Aegis Network Sport & Entertainment.
FIFA haven’t given a great deal of consideration to sponsors.
The sport is so big, they are less beholden than other sports,” he added.

FIFA has banned Franz Beckenbauer for 90 days for failing to cooperate with its investigation into the Qatar bribery scandal.
FIFA has suspended German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer for refusing to cooperate with its investigation into allegations of corruption related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.
Michael Garcia, the chief investigator for FIFA’s ethics committee, requested a 90-day ban for Beckenbauer, the Associated Press reports.
He’s the first person to be suspended as a result of the investigation.
The decision was taken pursuant to the FIFA Code of Ethics art.
83 par.
1, the ground that a breach of the Code of Ethics appears to have been committed and a decision on the main issue may not be taken early enough,” FIFA said in a statement .
The apparent breach related to Mr.
Beckenbauer, 68, was part of the FIFA executive committee that voted to give the World Cup hosting rights to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, BBC reports.
He’s a revered figure in Germany, having played on the country’s World Cup-winning team in 1976 and coached the national team when they won again in 1990.
He has since stepped down from the executive committee, but still serves as a special advisor to FIFA.
Beckenbauer claims that he didn’t cooperate with investigators because he was asked to answer questions that were written in English.
Earlier this month, a report by the Sunday Times revealed that former FIFA executive Mohamed Bin Hammam bribed top soccer officials with $5 million to secure support for Qatar’s successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
It’s unclear if Beckenbauer’s 90-day ban will prevent him from attending games at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.
In a shocking revelation, The Guardian newspaper reports that Michael Garcia, FIFA’s lead ethics investigator, has opted not to examine documents revealed in The Sunday Times explosive report .
Garcia is in the process of finishing a comprehensive report on the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and the allegations of bribery.
It appears with fresh evidence that could give more clarity to the situation, FIFA is more interested in imposing its own arbitrary deadline than getting to the bottom of the evidence in this matter.
Examination of the new evidence would only delay release of the report by a few weeks but FIFA seems determined to shove the issue under the rug once the 2014 World Cup begins on June 12.
But the fact that Garcia will not properly analyze the evidence from the Sunday Times database, which will form the basis of further allegations about the Qatar bid in the weeks to come, will raise concerns that he has already formed a view.
Jim Murphy, the shadow secretary for international development, said: ‘If the Garcia investigation refuses to accept the Sunday Times evidence the process will be a sham and Fifa will be forever tainted.
Meanwhile, Michel Platini, the president of the European football federation, Uefa, is discussing the possibility of leading a sit-down protest when Blatter announces his intention to stand again as Fifa’s president in Brazil next week.
One thing is for sure.
Life is never dull at FIFA headquarters.

A lifelong lover of soccer, the beautiful game, he served from January 2010 until May 2013 as the Director of Communications and Public Relations for the North American Soccer League  NASL .
Raised on the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the old NASL, Krishnaiyer previously hosted the American Soccer Show on the Champions Soccer Radio Network, the Major League Soccer Talk podcast and the EPL Talk Podcast.
His soccer writing has been featured by several media outlets including The Guardian and The Telegraph.
He is the author of the book Blue With Envy about Manchester City FC.
In addition to his shameless corruption, Platini is a dinosaur.
He fought tooth and nails against goal line technology.

Meanwhile, David Cameron, who was one of the so-called  three lions  involved in the final push in December 2010 for England s doomed £21m bid to host the 2018 World Cup, said Garcia s inquiry should be allowed to take its course.
We will see what happens with this inquiry into the World Cup.
There is an inquiry under way, quite rightly, into what happened in terms of the World Cup bid for 2022.
We should let that inquiry take place rather than prejudge it.
Cameron said he, David Beckham and the Duke of Cambridge were assured by numerous Fifa members of their support.
But in the end England secured only one vote among the 22 executive committee members apart from that of their own Fifa vice-president, Geoff Thompson.
What is ironic and obvious in this excerpt is that the Prime Minister admits that Prince William, Beckham and him had bought  or attempted to buy  “numerous Fifa members” votes, yet noone dared call him out on it.
Mr Cameron, how did you get “assured by numerous Fifa members of their support”?
Mr Cameron what was your meeting with FIFA members about?
Mr Cameron, how did your final push went?
What lead you to feel confident that you had secured numerous votes before the voting even happened?
The exco members answered: “Yes Mr.
Cameron, yes Mr.
Williams, yes Mr.
Beckham we will vote for you”.
Of course nothing was promised in return, no bribery was necessary.
Just showing your face was enough, I am sure.
What difference does any of this make, to be honest?
Perhaps I’m being too cynical, but reports and papers mean nothing to these people.
They have their heads buried so deep that the only thing they could ever listen to is a mass boycott.
So long as stadiums are being filled and FIFA’s pockets are being lined, then there will be no change.
Say Blatter is kicked out, what difference would it make?
He would just be replaced by another rich so-and-so who will continue with the status quo.
We should not even care where the World Cup goes.
FIFA is the only one making any money off of this tournament.
Host nations get the “honor” of hosting meaning that they get to spend millions of dollars on bribing FIFA officials then millions more to build stadiums and meet FIFA requirements.
Then FIFA gets to take home the majority of profits from the matches they put on.
It is unfortunate.
I wish I could simply be a fan of sports, but no matter what, money is the name of the game now.
For me, I would love to get all indignant over this, but what’s the point?
All of this is just a fact of life and to think that soccer  or sports in general  is somehow above it all, is just being naive.
FIFA will do nothing.
The only way the 2022 WC won’t be played in Qatar is if the European Teams balk at playing in Dec-Jan-Feb due to league and boycott.

How about this: The USA starts planning to host the WC 2022  hell, we could hold the tournament tomorrow .

FIFA has banned Mongolian Football Federation president Ganbold Buyannemekh from soccer for five years for taking bribes, soccer’s governing body announced Wednesday .
FIFA said Buyannemekh  solicited and accepted payments  from Mohamed bin Hammam on two occasions.
FIFA alleged Buyannemekh accepted payments from bin Hammam prior to FIFA Executive Committee elections in 2009 and the FIFA presidential election in 2011.
Bin Hammam challenged FIFA president Sepp Blatter in 2011 but withdrew his name from contention just days before the election.
FIFA found Buyannemekh guilty of six violations of the FIFA Code of Ethics: general rules of conduct; duty of disclosure, cooperation and reporting; conflicts of interest; offering and accepting gifts and other benefits; bribery and corruption; and general obligation to collaborate.

Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Brazilian football confederation, has resigned, saying he had  done what was within my reach .
The intrigue enveloping Fifa has deepened with the resignation of Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Brazilian football confederation  CBF  for 22 years and a long-time powerful figure within football s world governing body.
Under pressure in Brazil over the organisation of the 2014 World Cup and at Fifa following a series of corruption allegations, Teixeira s resignation has been predicted for months.
When it came, however, he said it was on the grounds of ill-health.
Last year Teixeira took temporary leave of absence for diverticulitis, a bowel condition.
Teixeira s path to football s power-broking was smoothed by the former CBF and Fifa president João Havelange, whose daughter, Lucia, Teixeira married, although they later divorced.
Both men have pointed out that the CBF was poverty-stricken, despite running the game in a most glamorous football country.
Yet, although they brought fortunes to it, their regimes have been tainted by allegations of corruption.
Most immediately in Zurich is the likely publication of a settlement made in court in the Swiss canton of Zug, in connection with alleged bribes paid to senior Fifa officials in the late 1990s by the marketing company ISL.
1m , along with Havelange.
Fifa says it does want the settlement to be published but some parties named in it have applied for it to remain confidential.
The International Olympic Committee, of which Havelange was a member, began an ethics investigation into him and he resigned before it reached its conclusion.
Both men have denied wrongdoing.
Teixeira has faced mounting political pressure at home because of construction delays and doubts over Brazil s practical ability to host the World Cup.
Fifa s general secretary, Jérôme Valcke, last week sought to extricate himself from a row with the Brazilian government, claiming he was misquoted over comments that the country needed a  kick in the ass  to meet its commitments.
In 2001 the Brazilian congress called on Teixeira and other senior CBF figures to be prosecuted for 13 alleged crimes including tax evasion, money laundering and misleading lawmakers but no charges were brought.
Last year Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the Football Association, said in parliament that Teixeira had asked him, regarding the vote to host the 2018 World Cup:  What can you do for me?  Teixeira denied that and no action was taken.
Teixeira has also faced two federal police investigations, into the ISL allegations and whether he diverted public money from a friendly Brazil played against Portugal in November 2008.
Romario, the former Brazil striker in the World Cup victory of 1994 and now a member of congress, said on Twitter of Teixeira:  Today we can celebrate. We exterminated a cancer from Brazilian football.  Yet none of these investigations has produced any charges against Teixeira and, when he resigned, he claimed he had been a success.
Football in our country is associated with two things: talent and disorganisation,  his statement said.  When we win, talent is praised.
When we lose, it s about disorganisation.
He is succeeded, without an election being held, by José Maria Marin, 79, a former politician.
Marin vowed that little would change.

When FIFA, the organizer of soccer s World Cup, announced in 2010 that Qatar would host the tournament in 2022, the decision was roundly mocked.
Qatar had a tiny population, no history in international soccer, no domestic soccer league, no infrastructure to handle the massive crowds and the summer temperatures routinely above 110 degrees.
British newspapers quickly accused Qatar of using its massive petroleum wealth to bribe FIFA s voters to gain the World Cup.
Four years later, FIFA is on the verge of stripping Qatar of the 2022 World Cup.
FIFA has commissioned a broad investigation into allegations of corruption in the 2010 vote.
Even before the results of FIFA s investigation were announced, Qatari billionaire Mohamed bin Hammam was accused by the Sunday Times Of London of paying millions of dollars in bribes.
A Qatari official stands near the FIFA World Cup trophy following its arrival in Doha.
Qatar has been accused of massive human rights abuses of the guest workers who are building the infrastructure from scratch.
Five of the six leading sponsors of the World Cup  adidas, Coca-Cola, Hyundai, Sony and Visa  have publicly demanded that FIFA expose and remedy any corruption.
Only Emirates Airlines  based in nearby Dubai  has not joined the call to investigate how Qatar ended up winning the 2022 World Cup.
S.
Soccer and advised them to have their organizing committee ready in case FIFA withdrew the 2022 World Cup from Qatar.
S.
Soccer has denied that any approach has been made, but the soccer world is abuzz with anticipation.
It appears that all of the stars are lining up to move the tournament.
The Sunday Times of London provided a preview of Garcia s report when it recently published the damning results of its independent  investigation.
Millions of emails and other documents revealed that Qatar s bin Hammam set up a multi-million dollar slush fund that made payments into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African soccer federations.
7 million in payments through bin Hammam.
The investigation also uncovered million-dollar payments to Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice-president who sat on its executive committee.
It s too hot.
Qatar bakes under 110-degree desert heat during the summer, when the World Cup is traditionally played.
Those temperatures would be dangerous for spectators, and could be deadly for players.
Air conditioning is not feasible.
Qatar s bid was predicated upon building ten air conditioned open-air stadiums that would reduce temperatures to a cool 78 degrees.
It turns out that air-conditioning technology is inadequate for the job.
Qatar now expects to build non-air-conditioned venues that use traditional fans to alleviate the heat.
But the new plan would call for the playing surface to be a sweltering 87 degrees.
Playing in similar temperature when the air conditioning broke in game one of the NBA Finals, Lebron James fell victim to violent cramps that kept him from playing the crucial final minutes of the game.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter has already conceded that it was a  mistake  to plan to hold the 2022 World Cup during the summer in Qatar.
His potential solution, moving the World Cup to November 2014, would create entirely new problems.
The World Cup was always held during the summer so that it would not conflict with the European soccer leagues.
In America, the World Cup would conflict with the NFL juggernaut.
Too many stadiums and training facilities need to be built.
There is not a single World Cup sized soccer stadium in Qatar.
Qatar initially planned to build 10 stadiums, at a total cost of $4 billion.
Under budget pressure, Qatar has cut back planning to eight stadiums.
In addition, it will need to build training venues for each of the 32 teams.
Too much infrastructure needs to be built.
Qatar does not have the airports, ports, roads or mass transportation systems to handle the World Cup.
It is planning to spend more than $40 billion building the infrastructure necessary.
Tiny population.
Qatar has only 2 million residents and fewer than 300,000 citizens.
7 million residents are guest workers, largely poor manual laborers from Pakistan and India.
Massive human rights abuses.
According to the International Labor Organization, Qatar s guest workers are horribly exploited by low wages, dangerous working conditions and sometimes outright slavery.
Published reports estimate that at least 1,000 guest workers employed as part of the World Cup construction have died of heart attacks and other diseases.
Instability in the Middle East.
One of the ostensible purposes of awarding the World Cup to Qatar was to expand soccer s popularity in Arab and Muslim countries.
Since the World Cup was awarded in January 2010, those countries have been roiled by the Arab Spring, which led to revolution in Egypt  the most populous Arab country , Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and civil war in Syria.
It is hard to imagine FIFA wanting to place its premier event into this cauldron.
The evidence of rampant corruption in awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar  and the insurmountable logistical problems with staging a soccer tournament in the summer desert heat   will almost certainly lead to a  re-vote.   Particularly in light of the massive parallel investigations that have commanded headlines around the world, FIFA s investigation will have to acknowledge the massive misconduct.

Soccer governing body FIFA contributed about a quarter of the budget of a newly released movie on its history that avoids corruption issues that tainted the organization in the past four years.
United Passions, which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival last week, features Pulp Fiction actor Tim Roth as FIFA President c while Frenchman Gerard Depardieu plays World Cup creator Jules Rimet.
Sam Neill stars as Joao Havelange, the former president who turned the organization into a money-making machine before being exposed in retirement for taking bribes from a marketing partner.
Frederic Auburtin, who worked on  The Man in the Iron Mask  with Leonardo DiCaprio, directed the film, which is based on conversations with officials and information from the Zurich- based organization s archives.
The 78-year-old Blatter, who may announce plans for a fifth term before the start of next month s World Cup, was heavily involved and made himself available for several interviews, said Louise Maurin, chief executive officer of Paris-based Leuviah Films, one of the co-producers.
When the project was artistically born, they let us do what we wanted.
Maurin said in an interview from Paris.
5 million-euro  $32 million  budget.
The month-long World Cup starts June 12 in Sao Paulo, and ends July 13 with a final in Rio de Janiero s iconic Maracana stadium.
FIFA has in recent years made changes in an effort to improve an image battered by corruption cases amid a continuing investigation into the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Gulf emirate Qatar in 2010.
Absent from the film are figures including Mohamed bin Hammam, the Qatari ex-head of Asian soccer and a former Blatter ally.
He was expelled after a 15-year stint on the board following claims he tried to bribe voters with envelopes stuffed with cash ahead of his challenge to unseat the FIFA president in 2011.
Our movie is not an investigation about FIFA,  Maurin said.  Our movie is a historic movie about the history of FIFA from birth up until now.
It s a fiction.
Blatter had said he would stand down following his most recent election, when he ended up as the only candidate.
In recent weeks he s said he ll be a candidate again if FIFA s 209 member associations ask him to.
Mr.
Maurin said.
Roland Buechel, a member of the Swiss parliament who once worked for FIFA s defunct marketing partner ISL, said the movie is an example of Blatter s efforts to raise his profile, speculating it s part of a push to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
The movie hasn t received rave reviews.
Guardian newspaper correctly predicted that it wouldn t win any prizes at Cannes in France.
The Mirror said the film could be the worst- ever soccer movie.
Blatter, who is Swiss, joined FIFA in the late 1970s as a development officer, before moving on to become its general secretary under Havelange.
The Brazilian attracted sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co.
Adidas AG to sponsor the World Cup and got broadcasters to pay increasing amounts to cover the quadrennial event.
The World Cup is now worth about $5 billion.
Backed by the support and financial assistance of Bin Hammam, Blatter was first elected president in 1998.
Maurin said she was unaware of who Bin Hammam was.
Jack Warner, another long-time former Blatter ally, also doesn t feature in the film.
Warner, a former FIFA vice president, quit the governing body in 2011 amid a bribery investigation and denied wrongdoing.
Buechel said.
FIFA declined to say how much it contributed toward the movie.
Producers were given access to FIFA s film archive and were supported by its marketing and press departments as well as the office of general secretary Jerome Valcke, Maurin said.

Ganbold Buyannemekh has been banned for five years by Fifa.
A senior figure in Asian football has been banned for five years for “soliciting and accepting” bribes from the former Fifa executive Mohamed bin Hammam .
Ganbold Buyannemekh, the head of the Mongolian FA and a former member of the Asian Football Confederation’s executive committee, was banned by Fifa’s ethics committee for accepting the payments to back Bin Hammam’s campaign for the Fifa presidency in 2011.
He also accepted money from Bin Hammam when he was involved in an election to Fifa’s executive committee in 2009, narrowly beating Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa – the current AFC president – by 23 votes to 21.
A statement from Fifa said : “The adjudicatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee, chaired by Hans-Joachim Eckert, has decided to ban the president of the Mongolian Football Federation, Ganbold Buyannemekh, from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level for a period of five years.
Buyannemekh was found guilty of several ethics codes violations including article 21 which covers bribery and corruption.
Bin Hammam’s challenge against Sepp Blatter for the Fifa presidency ended weeks before the vote after allegations surfaced of payments to officials in the Caribbean.
He was later banned for life by Fifa’s ethics committee.

There are the comic strips that you read out of the Sunday newspaper as a kid, and then there are the comic strips laden with satirical critiques of current events, politics, and agencies.
The latter more likely produces awkward chuckles rather than hearty laughter because they point to underlying societal problems, which makes people uneasy.
While satire does exaggerate situations, there is always some truth behind them.
That brings us to FIFA, the premier governing body of international football.
Since football is the most popular sport in the world, FIFA basically runs the world.
Countries suspend their laws for FIFA, as South Africa did for the 2010 World Cup ; and FIFA sponsored matches have both incited and stopped wars, as in the cases of The Soccer War between Honduras and El Salvador after 1969 World Cup qualifiers  and the ceasefire between warring parties in the First Ivorian Civil War after the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup .
Having been founded in 1904 , FIFA is younger than many nations, and yet is arguably one of the most influential institutions in the entire world.
With great power comes great responsibility.
However over the years, FIFA has been marred by valid accusations ranging from corruption and money laundering to media suppression and election rigging.
Critics have called out FIFA and its current President Sepp Blatter an immeasurable number of times on these controversies, but as a governing body without official subjects, FIFA needs to answer to no one.
In its mission statement , FIFA describes itself in a good light, but the following satirical comic strips do not give that impression.
Instead, they pinpoint major issues in the way FIFA is run and how it runs football.
Does that mean FIFA is rotten to the core?
Accusations of corruption among FIFA officials have circulated for decades.
Now, they are being confirmed as court systems formally indict high-ranking officials of FIFA with fraud, bribery, or embezzlement.
Earlier in 2013, once a Swiss court ruled that  João Havelange, FIFA’s president from 1974 to 1998, took millions of kickback dollars  from FIFA’s financial partners ,  he resigned from his position as FIFA’s honorary president  .
At least 5 members on the ruling executive committee that decided the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were also convicted of bribery .
More specifics about key players in FIFA’s financial mismanagement can be found in  The Dark Side of FIFA: Selected controversies and the future of accountability in the organization .
Piling onto the accusations, former players who are no longer affiliated with FIFA have spoken out against current FIFA president Sepp Blatter and other high-ranking officials as well.
In 2013,  Brazilian congressman and former soccer player Romario called Blatter “a thief” and secretary general Jerome Valcke “a blackmailer”  .
For a more in-depth look into corruption within FIFA, consider viewing  Part 1  and  Part 2  of the documentary FIFA’s Dirty Secrets, created by investigative reporter Andrew Jennings with BBC Panorama.
The first comic depicts Blatter as the source of bribes, who “cleans up” his act by paying others off with a trail of money.
Interestingly enough, Blatter was has yet to be indicted with bribery charges.
The second comic shows Blatter as a player ignorantly trying to play in a field of corruption, which implies he thinks he can ignore the problem, but in reality it will be his own downfall.
Many have agreed with Wilmots and believe that both World Cups were bought.
According to BBC’s Panorama, prior to the 2018 and 2022 voting, discoveries had already been made that four members on the voting committee had taken bribes in the 1990s .
It would not be too far of a stretch to believe that they could have been bribed again.
Two members were also suspended when The Sunday Times exposed them for trying to sell their votes .
The first comic below touts that FIFA only chose countries with governments that are equivalently undemocratic and corrupt, which reiterates the corruption within FIFA itself.
To top it off, recent controversies in both Russia and Qatar have brought up major concerns over the well-being and rights of both workers and citizens of both nations.
Russia is hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, but recent anti-gay laws have tainted the Olympics’ credibility of equality , and lead many to wonder if this is a prelude to the 2018 World Cup.
Qatar also has anti-gay laws, but considering that FIFA has the power to temporarily override national laws during World Cup  as previously mentioned in the case of 2010 South Africa , FIFA could force Russia and Qatar to temporarily suspend of the anti-gay laws during the World Cups .
While that does not create any permanent solutions, it is still something to consider.
Additionally, accounts of horrific working conditions and forced labor leading to death in Qatar  has angered many who have outright suggested the possibility of moving the 2022 World Cup to the United States .
Similarly in 2010, South African workers went on strike over terribly long hours and minimal pay .
Unfortunately, the above comic is a social commentary of the awful irony that Qatari laborers, many whom do not have the ability to leave the country, are working in the deadly heat to build an air-conditioned stadium for FIFA.
Although it is somewhat late for the 2018 World Cup to be moved, there is still plenty of time for the 2022 World Cup.
In addition, if it were to be moved to the United States, the infrastructure is already in place, so the three-year delay would not be much of a concern.
However, knowing FIFA’s history, they will likely come up with some excuse or another and delay the decision until it is too late to move the 2022 World Cup from Qatar.
Blatter and FIFA’s role in vote-buying is hazy at best.
However, people are catching on.
Lennart Johansson, a previous opponent of Blatter, publicly requested investigations into vote-buying during the 1998 election, in which Blatter beat Johansson 111 to 80 .
Other people continue urging an in-depth internal investigation into the 2011 elections to determine whether Blatter exploited his position , but until anything is set in stone, Blatter will continue calling the shots until 2015.
That is reflected in the comic immediately above, as Blatter is compared to historical rulers who could not, in their reigns, dominate the entire world the way that Blatter currently does.
In the midst of everything, FIFA has pulled its fair share of Big Brother moments in attempts at silencing its critics.
The public has responded angrily to their restrictions, which has led FIFA to back down a bit.
However with every World Cup, FIFA tries to limit the freedom of journalists.
And each time it tries, FIFA only attracts negative attention towards itself.
FIFA supposedly supports freedom of press, but prior to the 2006 World Cup, the organization placed restrictions on digital publication of photographs during the World Cup and had a clause stating that news organizations “may not bring FIFA into disrepute” .
The comic below represents FIFA’s media restrictions crushing the world’s freedom of press.
For the most part, journalists ignored this during 2006.
The World Association of Newspapers  WAN  finally challenged and convinced FIFA to write in a new clause relating to press freedom in 2009 .
If it were not for WAN pressuring FIFA into a corner, it is doubtful that FIFA would have done anything.
Before the 2010 World Cup, South African journalists questioned FIFA’s press accreditation rules, which included that newspapers could not publish photographs or videos relating to events on their websites and that newspapers could not be sold within a radius of 800 meters around stadiums .
Come Brazil 2014, journalists will likely once again question FIFA’s media regulations, and for good reason.
If they do not push FIFA to change their restrictions, no one will.
Things are not looking so great for FIFA.
Not that it ever has outside of its bank account.
Despite the allegations and controversy, FIFA is still the major ruling body of international football and the FIFA World Cup is still one of the most anticipated events in the world.
Regardless of everything, people continue to attend FIFA-sponsored events and FIFA will continue to make millions off its agreements with its sponsors.
FIFA does have something to worry about, though.
If they are not careful, their legacy can be irreversibly tarnished.
With the advent of the Internet and social media, it is becoming increasingly difficult for FIFA to hide behind its false do-good publicity stunts .
People are becoming more and more vocal about the obvious corruption in FIFA, and there is nothing that FIFA can do to quiet them.
The thing is, FIFA does have the ability to be an actual force in change.
However, due to the track record of current FIFA officials, it seems that the only way things will change is with the inauguration of a new crop of officials.

In soccer the gears that player used are very important.
It can affect the way they play the game.
For example, the soccer shoes if they use defected shoes the tendency is they could not perform well in the field.
Germany won 7:1 against Brazil.
Israel is currently in the lead with 6:0 against Gaza… What a strange world!
Fifa, hah!

SAO PAULO – Thursday was declared a national holiday here because, well, if the Brazil national team playing in the opener of a Brazilian-hosted World Cup in this soccer-mad country’s largest city isn’t cause to just shut everything down … then what exactly is?
This was sporting perfection, or should have been.
Sixty-eight thousand packed Arena Corinthians.
Almost all wore Brazilian yellow, except for JLo who wore next to nothing  no one complained .
Flags were unfurled.
Songs were sung.
The weather was perfect.
The play between Brazil and Croatia was fast-paced, creative and competitive.
Yet there in the second half, even after Brazil took the lead en route to a 3-1 victory, an orchestrated and audible chant arose that marks a mood that can apparently cut through any jubilation and may cast a pall over this entire tournament.
Expletive] you, Mrs.
President,” some Brazilian fans chanted at Dilma Rousseff, who was in attendance.
Expletive] you, Mrs.
Perhaps only the combination of a corrupt FIFA and desperate politicians who do business with soccer s global governing body are capable of ruining a night that should otherwise have been so ideal.
Brazil won a World Cup game in Brazil for the first time since 1950 and in the midst of the madness fans couldn’t help but voice their disdain that it was even happening.
Oh, Brazilians still love the World Cup.
It’s the FIFA World Cup in Brazil they despise, an impossible-to-ignore boondoggle that’s seen a precious $11 billion spent on unnecessarily opulent  or just unnecessary  construction.
It d be despicable in a wealthy nation, let alone a developing country rife with poverty and crime, especially when basic social services such as hospitals and schools are so desperately needed.
Just miles away near the city center of this sprawling metropolis, rubber bullets flew and clouds of tear gas floated as police tried to contain protesters raging at the spending and graft.
Similar outbursts occurred in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday and organizers promise there will be no let up as the tournament fans out across 12 venues.
The idea that Brazilians would curse and march against the playing of a soccer game is both unfathomable and the starkest sign yet at the public’s growing disdain for FIFA and its way of doing business.
World Cup spending isn’t the only reason some Brazilians dislike their president here in an election year.
Every elected official has detractors, including extreme ones.
Rousseff is no exception.
However, the government writing huge checks to stage international sporting events – Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio as well – has become the touchstone for varying political factions.
In short, doing business with the FIFA and IOC, both of which command lopsided contracts, makes little sense to most everyday people.
FIFA awards the Cup to nations that can meet their regal tastes with elaborate bids long on flashy construction projects that seem preposterous.
Brazil has built state-of-the-art stadiums across its country, spreading the graft to even smaller, out of the way cities with no logical reason to host.
That includes a $270 million monstrosity in the Amazon city of Manaus that even defenders can’t claim there is a good use for after it holds four Cup games  and the wet season may ruin the playing surface anyway  .
Meanwhile, FIFA takes all of the global television and local ticket revenue, leaving host countries awash in debt and trying to justify the expense on the benefits of increased global publicity and some tourism.
Economic study after economic study has shown this is an illusion.
FIFA demands host nations pass laws to protect itself from all taxes, even local levies.
It has a famously corrupt bidding process.
Yet Brazil went along with it.
The awarding of the Cup to its next two host nations – Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022 – is already under investigation for bribery accusations.
The Qatar event has already descended into unforgivable evil as over 1,000 migrant workers have died constructing facilities and infrastructure, and they aren t close to done.
As soccer grows in popularity around the world and technology brings fans closer together and the action to everyone, FIFA has managed to find a way to squeeze a measure of joy out of the game even among its most passionate fans.
Not even the 64-years-in-waiting thrill of seeing the Brazilians dazzle in World Cup play in Brazil could stop fans inside and outside the stadium of forgetting the cost, of ignoring the endless troubles that watching sports are supposed to allow to temporarily fade away.
The Brazilians and Croatians played a brilliant game that had a bit of everything, including referee conspiracies.
It will be the start of a month of greatness that will entertain the globe.
But when a night that should have been without blemish finds fans so obsessed with fiscal policy and national politics that they figure late in a 2-1 game was a necessary time to tell their president to “ off,” the problem is real and not abating.
The game remains beautiful.
FIFA and their complicit politicians have just made the rest of it so damn ugly.
The 2022 FIFA World Cup will be the 22nd FIFA World Cup , an international football tournament that is scheduled to take place in Qatar in 2022.
It will be the first World Cup in the Middle East, and the first Arab country to host the FIFA World Cup, and the first in Asia since 2002 .
The tournament will involve 32 national teams, including that of the host nation, and will consist of a total of 64 games, assuming the current format of the finals is maintained.
The scheduling of the event remains uncertain; however owing to the climate in Qatar , concerns about holding the event during the traditional months for the World Cup finals of June and July have been expressed since the bid was made.
In October 2013, a taskforce was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
1] The host Qatar has also been the subject of intense criticism because of the way it has handled many of the construction projects; hundreds of workers have died since the country was awarded the competition in 2010.
Furthermore, accusations of corruption and bribery have been made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event.
FIFA is conducting an ongoing investigation into these allegations.
There have also been calls to have the World Cup moved to another country.
2] On 22 September 2014, Theo Zwanziger , a member of the executive committee of FIFA, stated that he believed the 2022 FIFA World Cup will not be held in Qatar due to scorching heat.
The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.
4] Initially, eleven bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings,  and Indonesia  s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.
6] Indonesian officials had not ruled out a bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , until Qatar took the 2022 cup.
During the bidding process, all non-UEFA nations gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, thus making the UEFA nations ineligible for the 2022 bid.
In the end, there were five bids for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea and the United States.
The twenty-two member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.
7] Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.
There have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving members of FIFA s executive committee.
These allegations are being investigated by FIFA.
See below: Bidding corruption allegations .
Qatar is the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup – the next smallest by area is Switzerland, host of the 1954 FIFA World Cup , which is more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of the current 32.
7 million.
8 million by 2020.
The qualification process for the 2022 World Cup has not yet been announced.
All FIFA member associations , of which there are currently 209,  are eligible to enter qualification.
Qatar , as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament.
A Qatar may still qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup .
If they do, they will appear in the World Cup for the first time in 2018 and for the second time in 2022.
Otherwise, they will make their debut appearance in 2022.
The first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010.
The stadiums aim to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 °C  36 °F , and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.
15] All of the five stadium projects launched have been designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners .
The Al-Khor Stadium is planned for Al Khor , located 50 kilometres north of Doha .
The stadium will have a total capacity of 45,330, with 19,830 of the seats forming part of a temporary modular upper tier.
The Al-Wakrah Stadium , to be located in Al-Wakrah in southern Qatar, will have a total capacity of 45,120 seats.
The stadium will also contain a temporary upper tier of 25,500 seats.
The stadium will be surrounded by large solar panels and will be decorated with Islamic art .
The Al-Wakrah and Al-Khor stadiums would have been built regardless of whether Qatar was awarded the World Cup, according to the bid committee.
However, the temporary upper-tier sections will now also be added as Qatar has won the right to host the tournament.
A report released on 9 December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that other nations could host some matches during the World Cup.
However, no specific countries were named in the report.
17] Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA s executive committee.
18] Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding games in Bahrain , United Arab Emirates , and possibly Saudi Arabia would help to incorporate the people of the region during the tournament.
According to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch ; the investment banking division of Bank of America , the organizers in Qatar have requested from FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs.
Qatar wishes to cut the number of venues to 8 or 9 from the 12 originally planned.
A number of groups and media outlets have expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event,   with regard to interpretations of human rights , particularly worker conditions, the rights of fans in the LGBT community ,    climatic conditions and accusations of Qatar for supporting terrorism both diplomatically and financially.
The selection of Qatar as the host country has been controversial; FIFA officials were accused of corruption and allowing Qatar to  buy  the World Cup,  the treatment of construction workers was called into question by human rights groups,  and the high costs needed to make the plans reality were criticised.
The climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to winter.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter later remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a  mistake  because of the extreme heat.
The issue of migrant workers  rights has also attracted attention, with an investigation by The Guardian newspaper claiming that many workers are denied food and water, have their identity papers taken away from them, and that they are not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves .
The Guardian has estimated that up to 4,000 workers may die due to lax safety and other causes by the time the competition is held.
28] These claims are based upon the fact that 400 Nepalese  and over 700 migrant Indian  workers have already died on various building sites in the country since 2010, when Qatar s bid as World Cup s host was won.
Qatar has faced growing pressure over its hosting of the World Cup in relation to allegations over the role of former top football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid.
5m by Qatar  She later retracted her claims.
35]  More suspicions emerged in March 2014 when it was discovered that disgraced former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2 million from a firm linked to Qatar s successful campaign.
The FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.
Four of FIFA s six primary sponsors, Sony , Adidas , Visa and Coca-Cola , have called upon FIFA to investigate the claims.
38]  The Sunday Times published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents.
40] FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce has gone on record stating he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven.
Despite the claims, the Qataris insist that the corruption allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by those who do not want the World Cup staged in such a country.
Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup and that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy .

CNN  -- FIFA has employed a pair of high-profile crimefighters to help tackle corruption in the game, after a wake of scandals that have engulfed soccer s world governing body.
President Sepp Blatter announced that former United States attorney Michael J Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert had joined the organization to probe allegations of wrongdoing.
Their first task will be to investigate a Swiss court document after an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner International Sports and Leisure  ISL  to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira.
64 million  from marketing partner ISL.
Last week Blatter admitted that he did know about the alleged bribes handed to former FIFA executives, but insisted he didn t think they were illegal at the time.
As well as the new appointments, Blatter also announced a new FIFA Code of Ethics which includes provision to remove time limitations for the prosecution of bribery and corruption cases.
Kickbacks and cover-ups at FIFA?
A turbulent period for FIFA began in May 2010.
Whilst most of the world s soccer fans were more concerned with Africa s first World Cup finals that June, FIFA was presented with official bid documents by Australia, England, Netherlands Belgium, Japan, South Korea, Qatar, Russia, Spain Portugal and the United States for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.
During the ceremony at its Swiss headquarters, FIFA announced dates for inspections of the bidding nations from July-September.
British newspaper Mail On Sunday reveals that English bid leader David Triesman was secretly recorded making comments about alleged attempts by Spain and Russia to bribe referees at the imminent 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Russia s Prime Minister Vladimir Putin meets the visiting FIFA inspection team in Moscow.
Qatar is the last country to receive the inspectors in September.
FIFA provisionally suspends Amos Adamu, pictured, and Reynald Temarii three days after Britain s Sunday Times newspaper claimed they offered to sell their World Cup votes.
Adamu, head of the West Africa Football Union, denies the charge that he asked for $800,000 to be paid to him directly so four artificial pitches could be built in his native Nigeria.
57-year-old says in a statement.
4 million to build a youth academy for the Oceania Football Confederation, of which he has been head since 2004.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter, pictured here meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron a week earlier, tells reporters in Zurich.
FIFA releases its bid inspection reports, and it s bad news for Qatar.
The tournament would be held in the middle of Qatar s summer where temperatures regularly hit 50 degrees Celsius.
Despite a hi-tech pitch that included state-of-the-art cooling technology to keep players and fans safe, FIFA gave one part of the bid a  high  risk rating.
In the report it stated that hosting the World Cup in June and July would be  considered as a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken .
FIFA confirms the suspension of executive committee members Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, along with four additional officials.
Ahead of the December 2 ballot to decide the host of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments, Adamu receives a three-year ban and $11,947 fine and Temarii a 12-month ban and a $5,973 fine.
However, the organization rules that there is no evidence to support allegations of collusion between rival bid teams.
Adamu plans to appeal.
Issa Hayatou from Cameroon is one of three FIFA officials -- the others Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay and Ricardo Teixeira from Brazil -- who are named in a BBC program which alleges they took bribes from the ISL marketing company who secured World Cup rights in the 1990s.
All three had votes voting in the December 2 decisions on the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
The International Olympic Committee announces it will launch an investigation into allegations on BBC s Panorama program that Issa Hayatou, who is also an IOC member, took bribes.
Hayatou says he is considering legal action against the BBC.
Football world governing body FIFA says the allegations have already been investigated and the matter is closed.
The winning bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals are announced.
Russia wins the bid to host the 2018 tournament, with England garnering just two votes despite a last minute meet-and-greet blitz involving UK Prime Minister David Cameron, David Beckham and Prince William.
But the big shock came when Blatter announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup.
After months of speculation, Asian Football Confederation chief Mohamed bin Hammam announces he is to stand against Blatter in FIFA s presidential election.
Bin Hammam, a Qatari, was a key figure in ensuring that Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup.
Just a few weeks before FIFA s presidential vote, former FA chairman David Triesman gives evidence at a UK parliamentary enquiry into England s failed 2018 bid.
Under the cover of parliamentary privilege Triesman accused FIFA Ex Co members Warner, Nicholas Leoz, Ricardo Texeira and Worawi Makudi of trying to secure cash and privileges in return for their vote.
5 million by Qatar for their World Cup vote.
All those accused strenuously deny the allegations.
FIFA announces that it will expand its corruption probe to include Sepp Blatter, after AFC president Mohammed bin Hammam claimed Blatter knew about cash payments he was accused of giving to national football association in exchange for pro-Hammam votes during Qatar s 2022 World Cup bid.
Blatter maintains that the allegations are  without substance , and is subsequently exonerated by FIFA s ethics committee two days later.
Crisis?
But FIFA s ethics committee upholds the complaints against Bin Hammam and Warner.
Hammam is effectively barred from standing in the election.
Warner s football  tsunami  turns out to be an email, which Warner releases to the press, where secretary general Jerome Valcke seems to suggest that Qatar  bought  the right to host the 2022 World Cup.
After initially threatening legal action, Qatar withdraws its complaint when Valcke explains he was referring to Qatar s large, and legal, campaign budget, rather than bribes.
Warner will face no further action following his resignation and the presumption of his innocence will remain.
Just a few days before the vote, both Warner and Blatter s presidential rival Mohamed Bin Hammam are suspended after fellow Ex Co member Chuck Blazer submits a report alleging that the two men paid $40,000 worth of bribes to secure the support of members of the Caribbean Football Union.
Both deny the claims, with Warner promising a  tsunami  of revelations to clear his name.
Despite a last minute attempt by the English FA to postpone the vote - a proposal which garnered just 17 out of the available 208 votes -Sepp Blatter is re-elected for a fourth term as president of FIFA at the 61st FIFA Congress at Hallenstadion in Zurich.
He vows to learn from past mistakes and undertake a reform agenda.
Former head of the Asian Football Confederation Mohamed Bin Hammam was banned for life by FIFA after a two-day hearing into bribery allegations.
Chuck Blazer announces he will step down from his role as general secretary of CONCACAF at the end of the year.
American Blazer was one of the men who voted on the location for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces the introduction of four new task forces and a  Committee of Good Governance  aimed at reforming the organization and repairing its reputation.
He said the new two-chamber court would help to prosecute cases more quickly and could look retrospectively at old cases, including the process surrounding the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively.

I remain 100% committed to reforms and FIFA fully backs Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert, the two new independent chairmen.

Meanwhile, Mohamed bin Hammam, a former challenger to Blatter for the FIFA presidency, has been suspended for 30 days over new corruption allegations.
The Qatari was banned from soccer for life after a FIFA probe found him guilty of offering bribes in return for votes during his challenge to Blatter, which he withdrew hours before his ban.
He was temporarily replaced as head of the Asian Football Confederation, after serving for nine years as president.
Bin Hammam has repeatedly protested his innocence and has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport with a verdict due this week.
But the AFC announced on their website that he had been suspended after an inspection of the organization s accounts.
The audit concerned  the negotiation and execution of certain contracts and with the financial transactions made in and out of AFC bank accounts and his personal account during the tenure of Mr Bin Hammam s presidency,  it said.

Norway s Martin Odegaard is being sought by Europe s top clubs.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter has long been known for having a loose tongue.
This time, the most powerful man in soccer may have told too much of the truth for his own good.
Over the course of this year,  France Football  and England s Daily Mail  have published stories investigating the deep links between Qatar s government, France s government, and the dramatic infusion of cash into French soccer.
France Football even accused Sarkozy of directly colluding with Qatari leaders to ensure that Platini would vote for that nation s bid.
In addition to the allegations of corruption, awarding the World Cup to Qatar has sparked a worldwide uproar because of the oppressive summer heat in that country.
Though that would solve the weather problem, it would cause upheaval across the sport.
Many leagues around the world, including all of the top leagues in Europe, play a winter-centric schedule.
A World Cup in December or January would force a years-long reconfiguration of the soccer calendar.
There are many people who want the tournament taken out of Qatar entirely.
Ever since the hosting rights were won was won - indeed, before the vote to award them was even taken - there were many allegations of bribery and corruption in the bidding process.
More recently, Football Federation Australia chairman Frank Lowy asked for over $40 million in compensation from FIFA for its failed 2022 bid, and also damages relating to uprooting the soccer calendar.
Not surprisingly, FIFA denied that request .
FIFA s executive committee is scheduled to vote on the big move at its next meeting, which will take place in October.
S.
Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati, a newly-elected member of FIFA s executive committee, has called for delaying the vote until the entire situation can be fleshed out.
I don’t see at this stage, frankly, how I or any member of FIFA’s executive committee could make a sensible decision,  Gulati told the New York Times .  We don’t have enough information, and there are too many questions.
The last force against moving the 2022 World Cup to winter could be television companies - and they could be a powerful force, given how much money they pay for broadcasting rights.
Fox Sports, which paid $425 million for English-language rights to air the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in the United States, has said publicly that the value of its deal comes from playing the tournament in the summer.
FIFA has informed us that they are considering  voting on moving the 2022 World Cup,” Fox said in a statement to Bloomberg and other media outlets.
Just how much influence Fox really has with FIFA isn t clear.
Given FIFA s history of doing whatever it wants, the governing body might not think much of being threatened with one breach-of-contract lawsuit.
But if more TV companies around the world start making the same threat, FIFA might have to pay attention.
That could be the only force stopping Blatter, Platini and Qatar from having their way.

FIFA s decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has come under further scrutiny on Saturday.
FIFA s decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar came under further scrutiny as a British newspaper published new allegations that Mohamed Bin Hammam used his wealth and top level contacts to buy support for the oil-rich country s successful bid.
7million to secure key Asian votes.
Thailand   and that he was invited to visit Vladimir Putin before Russia and Qatar s victories in the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Under a front-page headline of   Gas deal turns heat on World Cup,   the newspaper alleged that Bin Hammam arranged meeting and favors for voters in the months leading to the ballots.
The 2010 vote, which awarded football s biggest tournament to the tiny desert state, is under investigation by FIFA s independent ethics prosecutor.
Qatar organizers deny any wrongdoing.
According to the newspaper, which says it had access to millions of secret documents during its investigation, Bin Hammam brokered two secret meetings with Qatari royals to discuss a major gas deal with a senior aide to Makudi.
The exact nature of the deal on the table is unclear, but it came as Thailand sought to save tens of millions of pounds by renegotiating an arrangement with Qatar to purchase 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas each year at a contractual price it considered too high,   the newspaper said.
Bin Hammam is no longer a committee member of world football s governing body after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed campaign for its presidency in 2011.
7 million Bin Hammam paid to Asian officials from funds controlled by his private company Kemco were used as he was campaigning for both the Qatar World Cup bid and for his own re-election to the post of president of the Asian Football Confederation.
The newspaper said he was invited to a meeting by Russia to discuss   bilateral relations   in sport between Qatar and Russia on October 30, 2010, a month before the vote on the bids.
Two days later, Qatar s ruling emir also flew to Moscow for talks about joint gas production deals between the two countries,   the Sunday Times said.

Global soccer leaders head to Sao Paulo Tuesday for FIFA s annual congress, but the event is being eclipsed by bribery allegations against a former Qatari soccer boss and sponsors  calls for a full investigation.
As soccer s most prominent delegates descended on Sao Paulo Tuesday, FIFA s annual congress was overshadowed by sponsors  unusual frankness over corruption allegations facing Qatar s winning bid to host the games in 2022.
German sportswear maker Adidas said.
The mood was also tainted after FIFA president Sepp Blatter lashed out the day before against people he said were  plotting to destroy  soccer s governing body, suggesting racism was behind the bribery claims.
Blatter told the Asian Football Confederation, without specifying who  they  were.
On Monday, two major backers of the World Cup - oil giant BP and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev - joined five of FIFA s biggest commercial partners in calling for an investigation into claims that a former Qatari soccer leader paid millions of dollars in bribes to secure his country s bid.
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of sponsor Budweiser beer - known in most of the EU as Bud - said in a statement.
The fact that five of FIFA s official partners - Adidas, Coca-Cola, Visa, Sony and Hyundai - have been so outspoken is rather unusual.
Traditionally big corporations would remain tight-lipped over something so sensitive and controversial.

6, 2011.
Qatar s 2022 World Cup organizing committee has denied being aware of any  alleged payments by the former head of the country s national soccer association to an ex-vice president of FIFA, soccer s international governing body.
2 million to Jack Warner, the former president of North American soccer s governing body CONCACAF and a member of the FIFA committee that chose the 2022 World Cup host.
Both men had left FIFA in 2011 after having been suspended by the organization during investigations into previous bribery allegations.
According to the Telegraph, one of Warner s companies had requested that payment in December 2010, two weeks after a FIFA vote selected Qatar to stage the 2022 tournament ahead of rival bidders the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea.
Qatar s organizing committee on Tuesday inisted that it had followed the rules of the bidding process.
The committee declined to comment on further questions asked by Reuters.
It was reported in March 2013 that an FBI probe into corruption in international soccer had recruited Warner s son Daryan as a cooperating witness.
Warner himself is currently a politician in Trinidad.
Opting to host the world s largest soccer tournament in a  desert climate  where daytime summer temperatures rarely fall below 104 degrees Fahrenheit has provoked widespread concern among Europe s leading soccer clubs, while human rights groups have drawn attention to  dire working conditions  in Qatar s construction sector.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter previously said soccer s  governing body had made a  bad mistake  over the bid processes for choosing the 2018 and 2022 World Cup venues, which were held simultaneously and led to the suspension of two executive committee members who attempted to sell their votes for cash.
Bin Hammam, the former president of the Asian Football Confederation and a former member of FIFA s executive committee, had challenged Blatter s reelection as president, but days before the 2011 vote the Qatari official was accused of trying to bribe Caribbean officials to vote for him in a plot orchestrated by Warner.
Bin Hammam and Warner both denied wrongdoing, but Warner subsequently quit his FIFA and CONCACAF positions, while Bin Hammam was banned for life from all FIFA and soccer activities.

World soccer s governing body, FIFA, is facing new allegations of corruption over its contentious decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
Britain s  Sunday Times  newspaper recently revealed it had evidence that a Qatari football official spent $5 million in bribes to FIFA officials in exchange for their support for the country s bid to host the event.
And, sadly, their politicians don t say:  Who is this person? Who is this person telling us that our governments, our laws, and our police are not allowed to look at corruption in football?  And if they started standing up to him, he d be finished.

2022 World Cup.
As FIFA was launching its own investigation into the bribery claims against Qatar, pressure was mounting to stage a redo of the bidding process and find a new location for the 2022 World Cup.
It’s a path that could lead to the United States as a logical destination, although Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati reaffirmed in an email to the Daily News that he won’t submit another bid until FIFA changes the voting policies that have come under fire since a bombshell report exposed international corruption.
At least one FIFA official said he is on board with a revote for 2022 if, as reported by the London Sunday Times, Qatar won the bid with the assistance of bribe money.
S.
Qatar in the voting four years ago and already has the necessary infrastructure in place.
But Gulati said he’s sticking by his assertion from last month, when he called for changes that included transparency in the voting, an emphasis placed on the technical reports from each bid and “clearer and tighter” rules.
The procedures would need to be very different to what they are now,” Gulati said recently about making a future bid.
FIFA had already started to overhaul the process, and presumably the vastness of the Qatar scandal will hasten those changes — and perhaps take the World Cup away from the Middle East nation.
I, certainly, as a member of the executive committee would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a revote,” FIFA vice president Jim Boyce said on BBC Radio.
If  FIFA chief investigator Michael Garcia  comes up with concrete evidence and concrete evidence is given to the executive committee and to FIFA, then it has to be looked at very seriously.

Meanwhile, the scandal involving Qatar spread across continents as more details were reported Monday.
According to the Daily Telegraph in the UK, Frenchman Michel Platini, the former president of European soccer’s governing body, held a secret meeting with Mohamed Bin Hammam, the Qatari at the heart of the bribery accusations, just before Platini voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
Platini’s emergence in the scandal makes France the first nation outside of Caribbean and African countries to be implicated.
The London Sunday Times reported Sunday that it obtained millions of documents demonstrating that bin Hammam, a Qatari former FIFA executive committee member, paid the equivalent of $5 million in cash and gifts to senior officials to ensure Qatar’s bid.

They said that the witness is Daryan Warner, the son of former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner.
The sources declined to further discuss the role of Daryan Warner, who could not be reached for comment.
They also would not say who might be charged, if anybody, or when.
While the exact scope of the investigation is not clear, among the matters under scrutiny are two previously reported allegations involving Jack Warner, who is currently national security minister in his native Trinidad and Tobago.
The deepening of the probe indicates that a succession of corruption scandals involving FIFA and other international soccer bodies in the past few years may continue to cast a cloud over the sport for some time.
Jack Warner was formerly head of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football  CONCACAF , as well as previously being one of a number of vice-presidents of FIFA, soccer s global governing body.
He has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
S.
Chuck Blazer.
That was a period during which Jack Warner was also head of the CFU, a position he held from the early 1980s until 2011.
The precise reasons for many of those payments is unclear.
In 2011, Blazer said that the payments were meant to be repayments to him by Warner of  a significant amount of money  which Blazer said he loaned to Warner in 2004.
Warner told the media in Trinidad that the payments were above board.

In a telephone interview from Trinidad, Francis Joseph, a spokesman for Jack Warner, said that neither Jack nor Daryan Warner would have any comment on the investigation.

Jack Warner quit his FIFA and CONCACAF positions in June 2011 in the wake of allegations of bribery in a report by a lawyer commissioned by Blazer, a member of FIFA s executive committee and former general secretary of CONCACAF.
The report alleged that Warner collaborated with another FIFA vice president at the time, Mohamed Bin Hammam of Qatar, to bribe Caribbean soccer officials so that they would back a bid by Bin Hammam to become FIFA s president.
Bin Hammam and Warner both have repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

CONCACAF issues, Bin Hammam had not been contacted about the probe.

FIFA s executive committee and will leave the position in May, said in a telephone interview that he had been advised by lawyers not to make any further comment.
Blazer said.
Bin Hamman was banned for life from all FIFA and soccer activities in 2011 for trying to bribe soccer officials in the Caribbean in the run-up to the election.
The ban was then reinstated in December last year for a separate matter concerning  conflicts of interest  while he was president of the Asian Football Confederation.
At one point recently, investigators from the FBI and the IRS traveled to the Caribbean and interviewed a witness regarding the alleged cash payoffs for more than two and a half hours, said a person who was in recent contact with the witness.
Andrew Jennings, a British journalist and author of the book  Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote Rigging and Ticket Scandals,  said he has had several meetings with FBI investigators working on the case and provided the FBI and IRS with what Jennings describes as confidential documents he obtained related to payments from soccer organization funds to offshore bank accounts.
A law enforcement source confirmed that investigators had held discussions with Jennings.
In an email, FIFA s media department said the Swiss-based organization was  unaware  of any FBI investigation related to the Americas and Caribbean.
The New York-based FBI squad which is conducting the soccer investigation is a squad that specializes in  Eurasian Organized Crime.  It is unclear why this particular squad is involved in the probe.

Top sports officials are alleged to have collected more than 18 million Swiss francs in bribes for TV and merchandising deals.
The soccer association FIFA is involved, and the case in Switzerland will expose a system of bribes -- and perhaps those who accepted them.
For Joseph Blatter, the world football association FIFA is an outfit that unites the planet, an organization in which values like decency, morality and mutual respect hold sway.
Batter is Swiss, and he s led the association of 208 national clubs  or 260 million soccer players  since 1998.
Blatter views FIFA as a complex, ethical work of art -- somewhere between the United Nations and Amnesty International, one that long ago should have won a Nobel Peace Prize.
But there s also another view of the organization, one that paints FIFA as a global money-printing machine, raking in hundreds of million Swiss francs a year, with revenues of more than 3 billion Swiss francs between 2003 and 2006 alone.
Just under a year ago Blatter dedicated FIFA s new headquarters in Zurich, which cost 240 million francs.
Now he can spend his time there dreaming of the Nobel Prize.
Five of the building s eight floors are underground -- evidence for his adversaries that megalomania and obfuscation are the real principles behind his tenure.
Since his election 10 years ago, Blatter has had to defend himself against the charge that FIFA can be bought.
He consistently denies the existence of any corruption.
But now Swiss investigators have found that sports officials, including representatives of FIFA, may have taken bribes numbering in the millions.
The district attorney s office in the Canton of Zug in Switzerland has drafted a 228-page complaint, which includes extensive testimony and evidence of a bribery system.
The prosecutors compiled this information for a case against six former managers of ISMM, a holding company dealing in sports media and marketing rights.
The case is scheduled to go to trial in Zug on March 11.
Apparently the company used secret payments to buy the support of key decision-makers in connection with the awarding of exclusive football rights.
The case also involves the second-largest bankruptcy in Swiss economic history.
ISMM had to file for bankruptcy in May 2001, after the company had upgraded its portfolio in previous years to prepare to take itself public, and had overextended itself while attempting to expand.
2 billion Swiss francs for television and marketing rights to the football World Cup Tournaments in 2002 and 2006; ISMM also used its subsidiary, ISL Worldwide, to secure rights to almost all major sports events, often at inflated prices.
2 billion over a 10-year period, got ISMM into a financially precarious situation.
According to investigators, ISMM and ISL Worldwide lost more than 860 million francs in the 2000 fiscal year alone.
The court will now have to decide whether executives of the two companies resorted to any crimes to prevent the collapse of their sports-rights empire.
The district attorney s office in Zug is charging the defenders with embezzlement, fraud, several counts of preferential treatment of a creditor, harming creditors and fraudulent bankruptcy.
It will call for prison sentences of between three and four and a half years.
The attorneys for the defense argue that their clients should be acquitted on all counts and demand compensation for their clients  legal fees.
Thomas Hildbrand, the extraordinary investigative judge who, like Blatter, comes from the tiny Swiss town of Visp in Canton Wallis, has spent three years researching the reasons behind the ISMM bankruptcy.
He has flown as far as Brazil and Japan to question witnesses.

Hildbrand s business trips also took him to Liechtenstein, where he discovered transactions that prosecutors believe ISMM used to bribe sports officials.
As in the recent tax-scandal case of Klaus Zumwinkel, a former German postal executive, shady foundations play a key role here.
One was called Nunca, established in the Liechtenstein capital Vaduz in 1998.
Sunbow, the second foundation, was established more than a year earlier in the British Virgin Islands, until it was acquired by Nunca on Feb.
8, 1999.
Even at ISMM, which went by the name Sporis Holding AG in the late 1990s, only a select few were aware of these connections.
The two foundations do not appear on balance sheets or organizational charts of the complex group.
Investigators believe, however, that they were clearly  economic business units  of ISMM.
Sunbow became a customer of LGT, the same bank German business executives like Zumwinkel apparently used to dodge German taxes.
Sunbow s account No.
31 soon became a busy place.
In late May 1999, the sum of 36,130,220 francs was deposited into the account.
The payment had come from Sporis Holding AG s account with Banque Nationale de Paris.
Between June 3, 1999 until Jan.
90.
ISMM Group concluded.
That s what it says in the file.

ZURICH, Switzerland -- FIFA has banned the Mongolian football federation president from soccer for five years for taking bribes from Mohamed bin Hammam ahead of the FIFA presidential election.
FIFA says Ganbold Buyannemekh twice  solicited and accepted payments  linked to one of the most damaging corruption scandals to hit governing body.
Bin Hammam withdrew his bid to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency in 2011 just days before the election after allegations he offered bribes.
Bin Hammam, who has always denied wrongdoing, resigned from all football-related posts in 2012 and received a new lifetime ban from FIFA.
FIFA says Buyannemekh took payments from Bin Hammam  in the context of the elections  of the Qatari s election to the FIFA executive committee in 2009 and then the presidential election two years later.

Did bribes have anything to do with FIFA s choice to give the 2022 World Cup to Qatar?
When the Fédération Internationale de Football Assn.
Qatar four years ago to host the 2022 World Cup soccer championship, it seemed an odd choice.
The tiny oil-rich emirate has neither a history of nor the infrastructure for top-level soccer, and the summertime matches would be played in life-threatening triple-digit heat.
On the other hand, FIFA s decision meant that for the first time, a Middle Eastern country would host the world s largest sporting event, an important milestone for the quadrennial tournament.
FIFA s problems run deeper than Qatar.
Australia and other larger nations: some $5 million in alleged bribes to secure FIFA site-committee votes.
The key figure in the scandal, the report said, is Mohamed bin Hammam, a former Qatari soccer official and FIFA vice president.
If true, that means that the culture of bribery reached high into the organization s leadership.
FIFA has already banned Hammam over unrelated conflicts of interest, and a ban even before that — related to allegations that he tried to bribe his way into the FIFA presidency — was voided on appeal.
Others allegedly involved in the events reported by the Times of London, including Qatar s bid committee, have denied wrongdoing.
But FIFA s problems run deeper than Qatar.
5 billion that country is spending to meet FIFA demands for hosting the 2014 World Cup, which begins next week.
And then there are allegations of match-rigging.
According to an internal FIFA report obtained by the New York Times, a Singapore-based gambling ring tried to rig as many as 15 international scrimmages before the 2010 World Cup in South Africa — a scandal FIFA has allegedly kept under wraps.
FIFA has tremendous power in international sports, and that brings with it significant responsibilities.
Yet these reports call into question the body s professionalism.
If governing votes can be bought and if matches can be rigged, then FIFA s core credibility is in doubt.
A full investigation into FIFA s governance and management should be undertaken by disinterested outsiders, seeking an open accounting of what has occurred — and a blueprint for how FIFA could be reformed.
2m  from    a Qatari firm linked to the country’s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup,    The Telegraph can disclose.
2 million  £720,000  from a company controlled by a    former Qatari football official shortly after the decision to award the    country the tournament.
Payments totalling almost $750,000  £450,000  were made to Mr Warner’s sons,    documents show.
A further $400,000  £240,000  was paid to one of his    employees.
It is understood that the FBI is now investigating Trinidad-based Mr Warner    and his alleged links to the Qatari bid, and that the former Fifa official’s    eldest son, who lives in Miami, has been helping the inquiry as a    co-operating witness.
The awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was one of the most controversial    decisions in sporting history.
The intense summer heat in the desert nation    has raised the prospect of the tournament being moved to the winter for the    first time.
Although Qatar has repeatedly denied wrongdoing during the bidding process, it    has long been suspected that the decision was flawed, and several members of    the Fifa committee have faced corruption allegations.
2 million  £720,000  to Mr    Warner in 2011.
2 million in payment for work carried out between 2005    and 2010.
The document is dated December 15, 2010, two weeks after Qatar won the right    to host the tournament, and states that the money is “payable to Jack    Warner”.
Mr Warner’s two sons and an employee were paid a further $1 million  £600,000     by the same Qatari company.
One document states that payments are to “offset legal and other expenses”,    but a separate letter claims that more than $1 million cover “professional    services provided over the period 2005-2010”.
At least one bank in the Cayman Islands initially refused to process the    payment amid fears over the legality of the money transfer.
The money was    eventually processed via a bank in New York – a transaction that is    understood to have come to the attention of the FBI.
A well-placed source    said: “These payments need to be properly investigated.
The World Cup is the    most important event in football and we need to be confident that decisions    have been made for the right reasons.
Mr Warner was one of the most experienced members of the executive committee    until he stood down in 2011 and served as vice-president of the organisation    for 14 years.
He was one of the 22 people who decided to award Russia the    2018 World Cup and Qatar the 2022 tournament.
It is understood that the FBI    is investigating payments to Mr Warner and that one of his family members    has been acting as a “co-operating witness”.
The investigators are thought to be focusing on Mr Warner’s American and Grand    Cayman accounts.
Michael Garcia, the joint chief investigator of Fifa’s ethics committee, is    also investigating irregularities surrounding the bidding process.
He is expected to deliver his report to the committee later this year.
The disclosures will add to concerns that some Fifa executive committee    members were not impartial when they cast their votes in December 2010.
England suffered a humiliating defeat when it secured only two votes to host    the 2018 World Cup and was eliminated after the first round.
Even before the decision was made, there were persistent allegations of    corruption.
Six weeks before the vote in Zurich, a World Cup official was    caught in an undercover investigation agreeing to sell his vote to one of    England’s rivals.
5 million for a sports academy.
Both officials were suspended,    meaning that 22 people voted instead of the usual 24.
A whistleblower also claimed that one of the bidders had bought the votes of    three African executive committee members.
The former Fifa employee later    withdrew the allegations.
Following England’s defeat, a parliamentary committee held an inquiry into the    failed bid.
Lord Triesman, the bid’s former chairman, gave evidence stating    that four Fifa executive committee members had asked for business deals and    favours when negotiating their support.
One of those he named was Mr Warner.
The Labour peer said that the then Fifa vice-president had asked for money to    build an education centre in Trinidad, with the cash to be channelled    through him, and £500,000 to buy World Cup television rights for Haiti.
In June 2011, Mr Warner resigned from all football posts after he was accused    of facilitating bribes to members of the Caribbean football union on behalf    of Mohamed Bin Hammam, who was standing against Sepp Blatter to be Fifa    president.
A report by the Fifa ethics committee found that there was “compelling” evidence that Mr Warner was “an accessory to corruption”.
Mr Warner was caught on tape apparently urging fellow Fifa officials to accept    cash gifts from Mr Bin Hammam, the disgraced former presidential candidate.
The documents seen by The Telegraph raise further questions about Mr Warner’s    activities.
One email, which appears to have been sent by one of Mr Warner’s    employees, shows that the staff member personally received $412,000 from the    Qatari company and that Mr Warner’s son, Daryll, was paid $432,000.
Daryan,    his other son, was paid $316,000 via a company called We Buy Houses.
Regarding the payments to Daryan, the email states that he was “contracted … based on his understanding, contacts and history with the regional players    who make up an integral part of the defence team … pursuant to Fifa bribery    allegations.
2 million” were wire transferred to J&D International, another of Mr Warner’s    companies, by the same Qatari firm.
It states that this is to “offset legal    and other related expenses associated with regard to an ongoing matter”.
Mr Warner and his family declined to comment.
A spokesman for Qatar’s 2022    World Cup organising committee said: “The 2022 bid committee strictly    adhered to Fifa’s bidding regulations in compliance with their code of    ethics.
The series of scandals have not only tainted FIFA, but undermined trust in the game as well.
Does FIFA’s corruption hurt the beautiful game?
FIFA, international soccer’s governing body, is corrupt.
The degree of corruption may be debatable, but its existence at the highest levels is not.
Over the past three years, at least a dozen of the organization’s 24 Executive Committee  ExCo  members have been accused of serious improprieties stemming from bribes, illegal ticket sales and other scandals.
While Sepp Blatter, FIFA’s president since 1998, has escaped punishment—so far, at least—many of his colleagues have fallen or resigned.
The endemic corruption not only compromises the quality of play on the field, but reduces fan support of the sport and tarnishes the beauty of the beautiful game.
For example, Jack Warner, the president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football  CONCACAF , resigned in 2011 after facing numerous corruption and bribery charges.
In 2006, FIFA’s Ethics Committee censured Warner after an audit revealed he made at least $1 million illegally selling World Cup tickets.
Warner’s deputy, CONCACAF General Secretary Chuck Blazer, earned the nickname “Mr.
10 Percent” for his rumored skimming on deals and was suspended for “fraudulent” behavior in 2013.
The accusations, however, extend beyond CONCACAF.
Paraguayan Nicolás Leoz, then-president of the South American Football Confederation, resigned after he reportedly took $130,000 from a marketing partner and requested knighthood in exchange for his vote supporting England’s 2018 World Cup bid.
Brazilian Football Confederation President Ricardo Teixeira stepped down from the ExCo after allegations surfaced that he took $41 million in bribes.
João Havelange, Teixeira’s former father-in-law, was also implicated.
The 97-year-old, who served as president prior to Blatter, resigned from FIFA and the International Olympic Committee just before both organizations planned to take disciplinary action against him.
Still, despite the corruption, the game continues to grow.
Selling the rights to the World Cup, which brings in nearly 90 percent of FIFA’s revenue, becomes a bigger business each quadrennial.
Africa and other new markets.
It is, increasingly, the world’s game.
So who cares if a bunch of old guys line their pockets while overseeing an era of expansion and growth?
Does the corruption matter?
Yes, for a number of reasons.
First, corruption creates a disconnect between the game’s governing body and the fans.
Even the presumption of unethical activity undermines confidence that real change will come to FIFA.
And with reason: efforts to overhaul FIFA’s leadership structures and introduce genuine reforms continue to stall.
In April, Alexandra Wrage, the chair of the anti-corruption body Trace International, resigned from FIFA’s Independent Governance Committee  IGC  after noting her frustration that the panel, set up in 2011 to encourage transparency, had little to no impact.
Wrage wrote a scathing article for Forbes blasting Blatter for ignoring IGC recommendations.
IGC head Mark Pieth stayed on, and while he continues to advocate for FIFA to make salaries public, no one expects that to happen.
Second, corruption at the highest levels of FIFA reduces the incentive to deal with problems on the field that affect fan experience, namely racism on the pitch and match-fixing.
ExCo members won’t take on more responsibility and accountability, jeopardizing their current comfortable situation, if they can instead continue to offer lip service to improving the game while doing little behind the scenes to affect real change.
In January, AC Milan’s Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the field during a friendly-match against Pro Patria after being subjected to racist chants from fans.
His teammates joined the protest and the incident made international news.
A few weeks later, supporters of Dutch club Den Bosch gave Haitian-American Jozy Altidore similar treatment.
The incidents were the latest in a series of ugly moments in the treatment of black players.
While FIFA created the Task Force Against Racism and Discrimination and even approved stiffer penalties for offenders, the leaders of the sport simply lack the moral authority to make deeper change, such as systemicly weeding out of racism on a club-by-club basis.
Match-fixing has also run rampant.
In February, Europol released the results of its 19-month Operation Veto that found 680 games with suspicious results, including 150 international friendlies and 380 World Cup and European championship qualifiers between 2008 and 2011.
The Europol investigation found that the fixing activity implicated 425 people, including referees and players, some of whom received bribes of over $136,000.
While the majority of the fixing happened at the club level, the sport’s most powerful body should take ultimate responsibility for cleaning up the game.
But fans won’t have faith that the ExCo will do so, when the committee itself is morally bankrupt.
And if nothing is done to address past fixing, why should they believe it won’t rear its ugly head in the future?
Those who think FIFA’s current scandals will be forgotten in a few years should look no further than the cautionary tale of Major League Baseball.
MLB’s steroids scandal of the late 1990s and the early 2000s still casts a shadow over the sport, even though the league has stepped up testing and enforcement.
Now, if a player produces beyond what is expected of him for any significant period, whispers about performance-enhancing drugs follow quickly.
Similarly, any time the calls in a FIFA match seem overtly tilted to favor one side over another, it will trigger suspicion of foul play.
The details of MLB and FIFA’s transgressions are different, but the lesson is the same: break the public trust at your own risk.
There is no hope of cleaning up FIFA until Blatter is no longer president.
But he isn’t going anywhere soon.
The best-case scenario is that FIFA will take baby steps toward resolving the problems that lie below the surface.
Every fan should be concerned that FIFA’s rotten core may have permanently stained the beautiful game.

Jennings has turned his unerring attention to the bun fight that masquerades as the global governance of football  Independent  The appalling Sepp Blatter and his cronies  activities are laid bare in a mind-boggling web of deceit.
Andrew Jennings is an internationally respected journalist, writer and film-maker.
His seminal book exposing Olympic corruption  The Lords of the Rings  was an international bestseller in 1992.
He has written for The Times, Daily Mail, Sunday Times and New Statesman as well as for publications all over Europe.
For many years he produced and reported for Granada TV s World in Action and also for BBC radio and television.
There is no doubt that Andrew Jennings did his research and has solid contacts inside FIFA, that lead to him writing his book Foul.
But sometimes I felt like he jumped to conculsions that some of the evidence didn t present.
On the other hand, because of FIFA s lack of transparency, there may be no other way to prove some of the points.
Over all it is still an entertaining and interesting book.
Opens the curtains to how cut-throat the politics inside the orgainizations are, and why it takes some bad people to navigate it.

This book is what I see as an almost continuation of another book called  Badfellas  FIFA Family at War.
It take over where it left off with the election of Blatter and a continuation of the research done discovering all the atrocities of soccer s governing body.
Only now in July of 2012 does most of this information come to public light as the Swiss courts just exposed Blatters mentor Havelange & his step son Texeira of Brazil.
It was eye opening then and sort of funny to see it all come to fruition as those who made Blatter in the last decade or more are the ones he is turning on and burying to save his own skin.

This book focuses on FIFA, the organization that manages soccer throughout the world.
They are best known in the US for the World Cup, but the tentacles of this group reach into every aspect of pro and amateur soccer in the US and the world.
If you like financial intrigue and organizational shenanigans, you will probably find many parts of this book interesting.
My problem with it is that the author seems to try to hard to tell a compelling story, and it makes reading the book tedious.
Having said that, the author has obviously researched the material and has done a fantastic job of uncovering some very bad behavior, and he should be commended for pointing out the wrong doings of this powerful organization.

Aside from wondering which national team will be crowned champion, for astute soccer fans the burning question of the upcoming 2014 World Cup is not can matches be fixed by gamblers, but will they be?
FIFA assures us that every precaution has been taken to prevent match fixers from corrupting any games played in Brazil.
The organization has begun an  Integrity Initiative  among players, featuring the catchy mantra  Recognize it, resist it and report it.  To aid in this program, FIFA instituted a hotline for players, team officials and referees to report  suspicious activity  anonymously.
The hotline also offers educational material  in five languages  catered to each group match fixers tend to target.
FIFA also has its Early Warning System  EWS  in place.
Launched in July 2007, the EWS, according to FIFA s website ,  monitors betting on all FIFA matches and competitions in order to prevent negative influences from betting. EWS also works to evaluate any opportunities and risks presented by sports betting for the game of football.  Staffed by dedicated personnel in Zurich, the EWS monitors every single FIFA-sanctioned match, searching for unusual movements within the odds and betting that may signal a fix is in progress.
Despite these efforts, there are still huge, gaping holes.
Ralf Mutschke, FIFA s head of security and a former INTERPOL executive, told the BBC that FIFA has already circled certain World Cup matches that they feel may become suspect.
Mutschke also revealed that specific teams have been identified as being vulnerable to fixers.
Worse yet, approaches to these teams and players have already occurred.
Mutschke told the BBC.
Given the amount of money at stake in the World Cup gambling market, players -- if tempted -- should be holding out for larger bribes.
According to the Guardian , the 2014 World Cup is shaping up to be the biggest betting event in United Kingdom history.
Perhaps more than £1 billion will be wagered through the legal sports books there.
Here in the United States, Las Vegas will see a healthy amount of soccer wagering as well.
In general, FIFA has maintained an ambivalent view toward fans gambling upon their sport.
The organization has not come out against gambling, nor has it actively encouraged it.
Gambling websites, including sports wagering operations, have sponsored teams and tournaments.
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa -- where warm-up matches undoubtedly were fixed  perhaps with the aid of South African soccer officials  -- FIFA allowed bookmakers to set up shop right outside the event venues.
The primary area of concern for Mutschke and the rest of FIFA isn t the legal gambling; it s what they cannot monitor or control: the vast, illegal gambling market in Asia.
No one can say with any certainty how much money is being wagered there on soccer matches, but estimates for this World Cup run as high as $1 billion in wagers per match.
Is it any wonder that Asia is where the majority of match-fixing syndicates originate?
4 million in cash was collected in raids relating to illegal gambling.
According to law enforcement officials, this soccer gambling ring booked over $6 million in bets in the course of just two weeks.
Arrests like these are a mere bump in the road for match fixers.
Like the Greek myth of the Hydra, if you cut off one head, two regenerate in its place.
Two of the most well known match fixers, Dan Tan and Wilson Raj Perumal, may be in custody, but that doesn t mean the problem is under control.
In February 2012, FIFPro, the worldwide union of professional soccer players, released the results of a survey of thousands of its members from Eastern and Southern Europe.
6 percent  admitted to being aware of match fixing in their respective leagues.
Nearly 45 percent of respondents in Russia  home to the 2018 World Cup  answered similarly.
Even worse, approximately 12 percent of players admitted to being approached to fix a match.
The root cause for much of this corruption is the non-payment of players.
Few soccer fans realize that athletes don t necessarily get paid to play in the World Cup.
FIFA hands the money that s intended to go to the athletes to the executives of each national team.
This cash is then to be transferred to the players.
Of course, given the state of corruption within FIFA, what is supposed to happen often differs greatly from what does happen, nationalism be damned.
Without pay, many players  especially from Third World countries  are not going to trot onto the field and give their best effort.
Not when they witness the amount of money being shelled out by fans, bettors and corporations on each and every match as it s televised across the globe.
With the proper bribe, the wise fixer can profit easily from this disparity.
We may have already seen this process in action.
The recent World Cup warm-up match between Scotland and Nigeria allegedly was influenced , even though it ended in a 2-2 draw.
While fixing a match to end in a tie may seem strange, the actual machinations of a fix are not necessarily what one expects.
Fixers often are interested in the total number of goals scored  the under over  or the margin of victory, but spot fixing targets smaller aspects of the game, such as throw-ins, corner kicks and penalties.
These sorts of manipulations are much more difficult for the EWS to detect.
While FIFA s security division will be in Brazil, ready to meet with each player, team official and referee as they step off the plane, there is one dark corner that remains unexplored.
That resides within each respective country s national soccer federation.
For the World Cup, allegations of nations fixing the outcomes of soccer matches -- including the championship game itself -- are not unheard of.
One person adding fuel to what most may chalk up as  conspiracy talk  is perhaps the most surprising: former FIFA president Joao Havelange.
In 2008, Havelange stated in an interview with Folha de Sao Paulo that both the 1966 and 1974 World Cups were fixed.
The 92-year old Havelange just may have been bolstering his own national team -- this year s host Brazil -- by making these claims, or he might have been revealing a long-held secret.
Led by soccer legend Pele, the Brazilian team appeared unstoppable, winning both the 1962 and 1970 World Cups.
But Havelange alleged that England and Germany conspired to break the country s dominance by rigging the 1966 and 1974 tournaments.
There is a case to be made for Havelange s claim.
Hosted by England, the 1966 World Cup tournament saw Brazil bow out in the first round.
One of the main reasons for the quick departure was that two of Brazil s opponents, Bulgaria and Hungary, repeatedly fouled Pele to the point of injuring him.
Argentinean captain Antonio Rattin had to be escorted off the field after disputing questionable calls in the 1966 World Cup.
England went on to win the 1966 World Cup, but not without help.
In England s quarterfinal match against Argentina, German referee Rudolf Kreitlein red carded Argentinean captain Antonio Rattin for arguing a call.
Rattin was so angered by this that British police were needed to escort him from the field.
Shorthanded, Argentina fell 1-0 in what the country labeled  the robbery of the century.  Lending more credence to Havelange s claim is the fact that West Germany beat Uruguay in the quarterfinals 4-0, thanks in part to English referee Jim Finney.
Here, the English referee not only sent off a pair of Uruguayan players, but he overlooked a handstop by a German that would have given Uruguay a goal.
Havelange alleged that the 1974 World Cup was a repeat of 1966, only with host country West Germany swapping places with England.
In Germany, in 1974, the same thing happened.
Interestingly, the final pitted home Germany against the same Holland team that ended Brazil s run.
The referee for this match?
Englishman Jack Taylor.
Germany won 2-1, coming back from a 1-0 deficit with the help of a goal scored on a penalty kick.
Four years later, Brazil was again on the short end of the stick, albeit due to a fix with more political motives.
Two years prior to hosting the 1978 World Cup, Argentina endured the overthrow of its government, as Jorge Videla became the nation s dictator.
Despite the nation s circumstances, the Argentinean team played well enough to advance to the second round.
One team stood in the way of reaching the finals: Brazil.
In this era of the World Cup, teams did not play a single-elimination tournament after the first round to determine a champion.
Instead, another round of three games was played, with the two teams possessing the best record advancing to the final.
In the case of a tie, each team s total goal differential acted as the tiebreaker.
As it happened, Brazil won two of its three of its games  tying Argentina 0-0 in the other  by a margin of five goals.
Argentina won its first game, but only by a score of 2-0.
To advance to the final, it would have to not just defeat Peru, but win by four goals.
That s when a deal was struck, in an incident confirmed in 2012 by Peruvian senator Genaro Ledesma.
More concerned with the rebelliousness of its citizenry than soccer, Peru s president Francisco Bermudez struck a deal with Videla.
The Peruvian team would lose by the four-goal margin; in exchange, Videla would allow Bermudez to exile 13 Peruvian political dissidents to Argentina, where they would be held as prisoners.
As Senator Ledesma explained,  Videla needed to win the World Cup to cleanse Argentina s bad image around the world. So he only accepted the group if Peru allowed the Argentina national team to triumph.  They did, beating Peru 6-0 to advance to the final match versus the Netherlands.
Argentina went on to win the championship.
More shenanigans followed.
In the 1982 World Cup, a first-round match between Austria and West Germany apparently was fixed.
Both clubs would advance to the second round if West Germany won by the exact score of 1-0.
Eleven minutes into the match, West Germany scored.
From that point on, the match was an exercise in futility, as that 1-0 score held -- to both teams  benefit.
Despite a protest from Algeria, whose national team wound up on the outside looking in thanks to the fix, FIFA allowed the result to stand.
Skip ahead to the 2002 World Cup, and once again a host nation appeared to be given favorable treatment.
Tournament co-host South Korea surprisingly advanced out of the first round to the Round of 16  knockout  stage.
There, its miraculous run continued by beating Italy and then Spain, on what many felt were questionable calls in South Korea s favor.
South Korea would not reach the final match, however, settling for a fourth-place finish.
At the 2006 World Cup, allegations surfaced that France paid Brazil $25 million to throw its quarterfinals match.
An email supposedly was leaked reading,  The Brazilians have taken compensation from the French that exceeds the winners  trophy prize, so they re now very cautious.  France won 1-0, with Brazil managing only a single shot on goal.
Adding to suspicion, none of the Brazilian star players would speak with the press after the match.
Then, just prior to the last World Cup, Lord Triesman, who was the head of the English Football Association, resigned his post after a recording surfaced of him speaking about how Spanish football authorities were attempting to bribe referees in the upcoming tournament.
As it turned out, perhaps coincidentally, a Spanish referee controversially red carded a German player, costing the heavily favored German team a 1-0 loss to Serbia in the first round.
While the defeat didn t prevent Germany from reaching the knockout stage, the irony of the controversy came when Germany lost 1-0 to Spain, who went on to win the entire tournament.

The president of FIFA, arguably the globe’s most important sporting body, had just made an announcement that would disappoint, among others, Prince William, David Beckham, Morgan Freeman and Bill Clinton.
Every one them had pressured, schmoozed and lobbied FIFA’s 24-member executive committee to select their countries as host of soccer’s World Cup.
But instead, the executive committee tapped Russia for the 2018 slot.
And for 2022, 14 of its voting members chose Qatar, the only country deemed a “ high-risk ” option.
Concerns about Qatar are  legion .
Nor has Qatar ever qualified for a World Cup.
FIFA stands for Fédération Internationale de Football Association, and its selections of Russia and Qatar have drawn criticism for years — along with whispers about unsavory wheeling and dealing.
Over the weekend, two explosive reports went well beyond whispers.
The Qatar choice was the target in a story Sunday that filled 11 pages of London’s Sunday Times.
The story itself is behind a paywall.
A detailed description of the story is available on the BBC Web site.
The paper said it had obtained and reviewed millions of documents that allegedly show how former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar — who was banned from soccer for life in 2011 for attempted bribery — bought the World Cup.
According to the report, bin Hammam funneled $5 million to soccer officials so they would support Qatar’s bid in a sprawling act of corruption that spanned the globe, but focused primarily on Africa.
According to the Sunday Times, Bin Hammam agreed — though, last week, Muinjo said the money had never reached his account.
Next up was the New York Times.
It, too, took a swing  at FIFA on Sunday.
The paper got hold of an internal FIFA investigative report that allegedly showed how match fixing had corrupted South Africa’s World Cup in 2010.
It provides extensive details of the clever and brazen ways that fixers apparently manipulated ‘at least five matches and possibly more’ in South Africa ahead of the last World Cup,” according to the paper.
Corruption in international sporting events is nothing new.
Russia’s Olympic Games in Sochi were called the  “most corrupt ever, “  and it’s believed hundreds of millions of dollars disappeared in preparations for the Games.
Allegations of corruption also marred  Beijing’s 2008 Olympics .
The International Olympic Committee is also no stranger to bribery allegations.
The Olympics landed in Salt Lake City after the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  showered millions  on Olympic officials, paying for vacations, plastic surgery and Super Bowl tickets.
Nagano, Japan, threw a  $240,000 party  for Olympic committee members before it locked up the 1998 Winter Games.
But in some ways, the recent revelations of FIFA’s allegedly corrupt selection process shine a harsher light on it than any international sporting scandal before.
That’s because the decision to give Qatar the World Cup comes with a profound human cost.
Under kafala, which pervades Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and a number of other smaller Middle East states, employers have total authority over workers.
They dictate whether a worker can go or stay and sometimes confiscate passports, all but imprisoning workers.
We are trapped in a nightmare,” one migrant laborer working on World Cup preparations  told the Daily Record  in April.
The system played a significant role in the  tragic deaths  of nearly 1,000 migrant workers constructing World Cup facilities.
Working in crushing heat, hundreds died of unexplained illnesses, including “sudden cardiac death,” which killed 246, while 28 more killed themselves, according to a report released by Qatar two weeks ago.
In the days after the report’s release, FIFA did some backpedaling.
He said the problem with Qatar was apparent from the beginning — hot summers.
But despite that the executive committee decided, with quite a big majority, that the tournament would be in Qatar,” he said.
If the allegations are true, World Cup officials said Sunday, there may be a re-vote for the 2022 World Cup host.
I certainly as a member of the executive co would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a re-vote,” FIFA Vice President Jim Boyce  said .
Others had harsher words.

World soccer body FIFA has opened an investigation into potential wrongdoing in Qatar s successful but controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
As has been publicly announced, certain allegations regarding events surrounding the bidding for the World Cup 2018 and 2022 were referred to the ethics committee by FIFA following media reports.
FIFA ethic investigator Michael J.
Garcia in a statement.
Nevertheless, with a proven track record of not wanting to rock the boat or truly tackle fundamental governance issues, FIFA is likely to ensure that the investigation, which will also look at Russia s winning of the right to host the 2018 tournament, will not result in either country being deprived of the honor.
The investigation will however have to further address the worst albeit politically loaded corruption scandal in the history of world soccer in which the bids are inextricably meshed.
The investigation follows more than a year of legal and political battle that late last year led to the final demise of Mohammed Bin Hammam, the highest placed Qatari national who was ultimately stripped of his membership in FIFA s executive council as well as his presidency of the Asian Football Confederation  AFC  and banned for life by FIFA from involvement in soccer.
The allegations of corruption and bribery against Mr.
Bin Hammam raise questions about the degree and nature of his involvement in the Qatari bid.
Qatar has so far successfully denied allegations that its bid may have involved corrupt practices.
And to be fair, much of the Qatari efforts, including funding facilities in home countries of FIFA executive committee members and friendlies of some of their national teams, do not violate the world soccer body s bid rules, but raise questions about the integrity of those guidelines.
Qatar has consistently denied that Mr.
Bin Hammam was involved in its World Cup bid.
While it seems strange that the highest Qatari soccer official in world soccer who enjoyed the backing of Qatari emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani at least until he announced that he would challenge FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the group s presidential election, that may be true for the final phase of the Qatari bid.
Mr.
Bin Hammam s presidential challenge sparked the allegations that ultimately led to his downfall.
To some degree, the interests of Qatar and Mr.
Bin Hammam diverged with the announcement of his presidential bid.
Mr.
Bin Hammam is believed to have felt that an almost simultaneous Qatari winning of World Cup hosting rights and the FIFA presidency may have been too much for world soccer to stomach.
As a result, he may have not been really involved in the final phases of the Qatari bid.
That leaves nonetheless the question open of his involvement prior to his presidential campaign against the background of multiple allegations and questions about bribery and corruption in his election campaign as well as the financial management of the AFC.
While there seems little doubt that Mr.
Bin Hammam violated international standards of financial good governance, his actions, with the possible exception of his negotiation on behalf of the AFC of a controversial $1 billion master rights agreement with Singapore-based World Sports Group  WSG  seem largely the result of sticking to a back-slapping way of doing business in the Gulf that is not internationally accepted rather than greed.
Whether that applies also to the WSG deal will only be clear once Mr.
Bin Hammam and WSG justify the negotiation procedure for the agreement that did not involve a tender as well as payments made to Mr.
Bin Hammam, according to an internal AFC audit conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC , by a WSG shareholder in advance of the signing of the contract.
WSG, which has so far refrained from commenting on much of the PwC audit, including the payments, has initiated legal proceedings against this reporter in a bid to squash reporting and intimidate sources.
While FIFA may steer clear of a renewed look at Mr.
Bin Hammam s AFC dealings in its investigation of the World Cup bids, the ball will be in the court of the AFC once it has elected in April a new executive committee that will be expected to demonstrate that it is making a clean break with the past.
Qatar has paved the ground for separating inquiries into its bid from Mr.
Bin Hammam s dealings by pressuring him late last year to give up his fight to maintain his position in world soccer.
Mr.
Bin Hammam s banning by FIFA coincided with his resignation from his posts in FIFA and the AFC.
Nonetheless, the FIFA inquiry makes Qatar more vulnerable to criticism of its hosting of the world s largest sporting tournament, including the rights and working conditions of the country s foreign labor force, who constitute a majority of the population as well as human rights following the sentencing to life in prison in November of a poet for a poem that was critical of Sheikh Hamad and the royal family.
Qatar has in recent months demonstrated that it is not insensitive to criticism and foreign pressure.
In a bid to fend off a boycott campaign of the World Cup by the International Trade Union Confederation  ITUC  which has 175 million members in 153 countries, Qatar has agreed that it would not penalize workers who form independent unions.
The ITUC plans to put that promise to the test later this year.
Similarly, in a rare concession to human rights groups, Qatar recently backed away from deporting to Saudi Arabia a dissident Saudi diplomat.
Instead, the diplomat, Mishal bin Zaar Hamad al-Mutiry, who accused his government of involvement in terrorism, was allowed to go into exile in Morocco.

PHILIP REEVES: Our Game Is Fair Play, so says the motto on the flag over FIFA s headquarters in Zurich.
These days, it has a hollow ring.

Allegations of corruption are flying faster than ever before.
Tomorrow, FIFA s members decide who ll be their next president.
Switzerland s Sepp Blatter, who s 75 and has held the job for 13 years, wants another term and is unopposed.
He had a challenger, Mohammed Bin Hammam from Qatar.
Bin Hammam withdrew Sunday.
Shortly afterwards, he was suspended from FIFA s executive committee, along with veteran member Jack Warner, pending a bribery inquiry.
The two are accused of offering big bundles of cash to officials in the Caribbean in return for votes.
Both deny it.
More than a third of FIFA s executive committee has been accused of one form of skullduggery or another in the recent past.
FIFA s decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a tiny desert nation some says is ill-suited to soccer -with its rowdy, boozy fans - has aroused particular suspicion.
There are calls for tomorrow s election to be postponed.
Two of FIFA s largest sponsors, Coca-Cola and Adidas, have expressed concern about FIFA s feuding.
The one man who doesn t seem worried is Sepp Blatter himself, the president.
There s no crisis, he said yesterday, just some difficulties that can be settled within the FIFA family.
Those words are unlikely to reassure anyone.

Fifa is facing fresh allegations of corruption over its controversial decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
The Sunday Times  has obtained millions of secret documents - emails, letters and bank transfers - which it alleges are proof that the disgraced Qatari football official Mohamed Bin Hammam made payments totalling US$5m  £3m  to football officials in return for their support for the Qatar bid.
Qatar 2022 and Bin Hammam have always strenuously denied the former Fifa vice-president actively lobbied on their behalf in the run-up to the vote in December 2010.
But, according to emails obtained by the Sunday Times and seen by the BBC, it is now clear that Bin Hammam, 65, was lobbying on his country s behalf at least a year before the decision.
The documents also show how Bin Hammam was making payments directly to football officials in Africa to allegedly buy their support for Qatar in the contest.
Qatar strongly denies any wrongdoing and insists that Bin Hammam never had any official role supporting the bid and always acted independently from the Qatar 2022 campaign.
When approached by the Sunday Times to respond to their claims, Bin Hammam s son Hamad Al Abdulla declined to comment on his behalf.
Although the vast majority of the officials did not have a vote, the Sunday Times alleges Bin Hammam s strategy was to win a groundswell of support for the Qatari bid which would then influence the four African Fifa executive committee members who were able to take part in the election.
The Sunday Times also alleges that it has documents which prove Bin Hammam paid 305,000 Euros  £250,000  to cover the legal expenses of another former Fifa executive committee member from Oceania, Reynald Temarii.
Bin Hammam was initially banned from football for life in July 2011 after being found guilty of attempted bribery.
The allegations centred around bids to buy votes in the Fifa presidential election of that year.
However his ban was annulled a year later by the Court of Arbitration for Sport which said there was insufficient evidence to support the punishment.
Bin Hammam then quit football saying he had seen the  very ugly face of football .
Fifa issued him with a second life ban in December 2012 for  conflicts of interest  while he was president of the Asian Football Confederation.
In March 2014, the Daily Telegraph reported a company owned by Bin Hammam had paid former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner and his family more than £1m.
Payments were claimed to have been made shortly after Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup.
Temarii, from Tahiti, was unable to vote in the contest as he had already been suspended by Fifa after he was caught out by a Sunday Times sting asking bogus American bid officials for money in return for his support.
But the paper now alleges that Bin Hammam provided him with financial assistance to allow him to appeal against the Fifa suspension, delaying his removal from the executive committee and blocking his deputy David Chung from voting in the 2022 election.
The paper claims that had Chung been allowed to vote he would have supported Qatar s rivals Australia.
Instead there was no representative from Oceania allowed to vote, a decision which may have influenced the outcome in Qatar s favour.
The paper also makes fresh allegations about the relationship between Bin Hammam and his disgraced Fifa ally Jack Warner, from Trinidad.
6m was paid by Bin Hammam to Warner, including $450,000 in the period before the vote.
The new allegations will place Fifa  under fresh pressure to re-run the vote for the 2022 World Cup, which was held in conjunction with the vote for the 2018 tournament, in which England were eliminated in the first round with just two votes.
Fifa s chief investigator Michael Garcia is already conducting a long-running inquiry into allegations of corruption and wrongdoing during the 2018 22 decisions.
He is due to meet senior officials from the Qatar 2022 organising committee in Oman on Monday.
But that meeting may now have to be postponed in light of the Sunday Times revelations which have raised important new questions about the link between Bin Hammam and the successful Qatari World Cup campaign.
Even in soccer-loving Brazil, citizens rail against FIFA and ask why desperately-needed resources are going to the tournament.
Beijing and London, England  CNN  -- No one thought anything was particularly amiss when Happy Valley lost 2-0 to Fourway Rangers in the Hong Kong First Division last October.
After all, Happy Valley was enduring a miserable season, which would end in a humiliating relegation.
The match would have remained an obscure result in one of soccer s most obscure backwaters, watched by just 442 people at the Sham Shui Po Sports Ground, had it not been revealed that there was something far more sinister than Happy Valley s ineptitude at work.
Earlier this month five soccer players were arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from gambling syndicates to throw the match.
Four have since been released on bail but one, Yu Yang, was sentenced to 10 months in prison for attempted bribery on 20 May according to the official Chinese press agency, Xinhua.
This was not an isolated incident either.
Soccer on the Chinese mainland is in crisis, mired in seemingly endless corruption scandals off the pitch, and dogged by woeful performances on it.
China has missed out on this summer s World Cup in South Africa, plummeted down the FIFA world ranking and, even worse, the state-run Chinese Super League  CSL  is experiencing its own corruption scandal that has spread to Hong Kong.
As well as the five players in Hong Kong, a further 20 officials have been arrested, including former Chinese Football Association  CFA  boss Nan Yong and his deputy Yang Yimin.
Two CSL clubs, Guangzhou and Chengdu were relegated from the top division for match fixing, postponing the start of the soccer season.
Most damaging of all, however, was the arrest of Lu Jun, a former international World Cup referee known as the  Golden Whistle  for his impartiality, on suspicion of taking bribes.
If found guilty he could face the death penalty.
There s corruption at every single level of the game, from the top to the very bottom.
Tang Yue, a sports journalist for the government-run China Daily, told CNN.
It really shouldn t have been like this.
Soccer, after all, is China s most popular sport.
It is estimated that anywhere up to 30 million people watch the English Premier League every weekend while 180 million watched last year s CSL on television.
Sepp Blatter, the president of football s governing body FIFA, was so keen to shore up support for the game that when China hosted the 2004 Asian Cup Blatter flew in for the final and controversially declared that it was the Chinese, and not the English, that had invented soccer.
Blatter told a soccer expo in Beijing, giving FIFA s official seal to claims that the ancient sport of  cuju  was the great-grandfather of the modern game.
In 2004 money was poured in and the CSL set up with much fanfare.
3 billion-strong soccer-crazy population -- China seemed destined to be the game s next global super power.
But now the national team languishes on a world rank of 85, between Moldova and Angola, and there are fears that the true extent of the influence of Chinese betting syndicates has only just begun to be revealed.
Rowan Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts, a recent book about soccer in China, told CNN.
There s corruption at every single level of the game, from the top to the very bottom.
It s an indictment of wider Chinese society and representative of a much bigger problem with corruption and nepotism.
It s more visible with football because your results are taken by your performance in international competition.
So there is nowhere to hide.
Xinhua reported earlier this year that 106,626 government officials were found guilty of corruption by the Central Commission For Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party s anti-corruption watchdog in the first 11 months of 2009.
Still, according to Transparency International s Corruption Perceptions Index China is ranked 79th in the world.
According to Simons, corruption in Chinese football is so ingrained that even players at the national level have to pay bribes to get a game.
There was even a rate card published in the press,  he said.  £10,000  $14,960  to get selected for the national squad.
To get a run out as a sub its £20,000  $17,950 .
When CNN put these concerns to the CFA they declined to comment.
The scandal has generated such bad headlines, however, that the government is now taking the problem extremely seriously.
A replacement has been found in the shape of Wei Di, who was in charge of China s water sports federation and who has no previous experience in soccer.
Even the sports minister had to be involved, and President Hu Jintao,  explained Tang Yue.  He has said he wants to improve soccer in China.
But this in itself presents another problem.
FIFA rules seek to protect soccer officials from government interference.
Chad, Kenya, Iraq and Iran have all faced suspension after FIFA claimed they suffered from such meddling.
But in China, where the line between government and private involvement has become blurred, no action has been taken.
It is this government interference, according to Simons, that has created the space for corruption and match fixing to exist in the first place.
Sport is government-owned and government-controlled,  Simons said.  People don t have the same personal responsibility for sport.
They don t think sport is theirs.
Others looking at the role of the Chinese government in sport agree that it is this relationship that has helped to undermine the game.
Christopher Renner, president of sports consultancy Helios Partners China.
Obviously, that s never going to happen entirely, but they should focus on policy and not the day-to-day running of sports, especially when commercial elements are involved.
This is where money comes in and the temptation is too great for these underpaid bureaucrats.
At least with football, they need to let market forces have more of an impact on leadership, owners, coaches and players.
Brazil 2014?
Tens of millions of Chinese fans will still tune in to June s World Cup in South Africa, cheering on adopted teams from South America and Europe.
But as Simons points out, whether the Chinese national team makes it to the 2014 finals in Brazil depends largely on their ability to keep soccer clean locally.
This is a central government crackdown which you get periodically: lots of people are arrested and  syndicates broken up,  he said.  The football crackdown is wider and deeper than many had predicted.
Has it ended everything?
No.
It has killed everything dead, for now.
Sports news,  hot takes,  playbooks, gambling advice, dunks, GIFs, and more.
TV, movies, music, the Internet, videos, recaps, precaps, pop culture, and more.
On December 2, 2010, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stood before a giant blue screen at his organization’s headquarters in Zurich and announced the two countries that had won the rights to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
After hours of presentations and last-ditch lobbying efforts from Prince William, David Beckham, Morgan Freeman, and Bill Clinton, FIFA’s 24-man executive committee — down to 22 after two members were caught trying to sell their votes to undercover journalists — had elected Russia and Qatar to follow Brazil as the next hosts of soccer’s biggest tournament.
On the face of it, the choices were surprising.
FIFA’s inspection team had evaluated all nine bids 1 and rated Russia and Qatar as the riskiest of the lot.
Russia presented major infrastructure problems.
Nevertheless, Blatter, a winking, bald-pated 75-year-old from FIFA’s home country of Switzerland, looked overjoyed as he read out the results.
I am a happy president,” he gushed.
FIFA has a longstanding reputation for corruption, and even before the executive committee convened, there was widespread concern that the voting would be rigged.
Alarming details had been leaking out for months.
In October, Sunday Times reporters posing as American lobbyists had secretly videotaped two ExCo members, Tahiti’s Reynald Temarii and Nigeria’s Amos Adamu, demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars for their votes.
They each claimed that the money would be used for development projects — a soccer academy in Auckland, New Zealand, four artificial fields in Nigeria — but wanted the money to be paid to them directly.
Three days before the vote, the BBC’s Panorama program broadcast an investigation into FIFA corruption that accused three current ExCo members of taking bribes in the 1990s.
In the weeks after the vote, the suspicion intensified.
It was noted among the losing nations that the committee had handed the World Cup to two oil-rich countries with troubling, arguably outright authoritarian governments.
In doing so, it had voted down bids — including those from the United States, England, and Japan — that outperformed the winning nations in both tournament-readiness and revenue potential.
England’s bid, one of the most highly praised by the inspection team, received a paltry two votes.
Multiple newspapers reported that the delegates from CONCACAF, the governing body of North American soccer, had voted against the country from their own confederation, the United States.
FIFA had faced this sort of suspicion before.
Both Blatter’s election as president in 1998 and his first reelection campaign were dogged by allegations of bribery.
The old boys on the ExCo — it has never had a female member — had long been rumored to buy votes, manipulate TV deals, get fat on corporate kickbacks.
Sometimes there were more than rumors.
In 2006, Jack Warner, the head of CONCACAF, was censured by FIFA’s Ethics Committee when an Ernst & Young audit found that he’d made a million-dollar profit selling World Cup tickets in Trinidad.
None of this had ever really fazed FIFA.
But the rumblings about Russia and Qatar persisted for months, and they came at the worst possible time for Blatter.
His third term as president was up in June, and he faced an unexpected challenger in the election: Mohammed bin Hammam, the Qatari head of the Asian soccer confederation and a key mover behind Qatar’s successful World Cup bid.
Bin Hammam had once been known as a Blatter loyalist; now, somewhat breathtakingly, he was capitalizing on the widespread mistrust of Blatter by running for the presidency on an anticorruption platform.
By May 22, when the allegations followed Blatter on a trip to South Africa, the normally merry president was reduced to pounding his hand on a table and exhorting journalists to “stop please to say FIFA is corrupt.
FIFA is not corrupt!
Three days later, however, under pressure from bin Hammam, FIFA surprised the soccer world by launching a major corruption investigation.
Its target: bin Hammam himself, whom a curiously timed report had accused of trying to buy the votes of Caribbean officials for $40,000 each.
Bin Hammam insisted he was innocent.
They didn’t.
On May 29, bin Hammam was suspended from FIFA.
On June 1, Sepp Blatter was reelected as an unopposed candidate.
Should it matter to soccer fans if FIFA is corrupt?
By almost any measure the game is thriving, with more fans in more corners of the world, every day.
If the combined audience for just the final two rounds of the 2010 World Cup were a country, it would be, by far, the most populous nation on earth.
Most of these fans seem to be enjoying themselves, so if a cabal of scheming old men in Zurich happens to be pulling strings behind the scenes, why should the rest of us worry?
It’s easy to see FIFA as unimportant in part because, as the Blatter-bin Hammam wrangle illustrates, there’s something deeply silly about many of the organization’s Machiavellian twists.
One of the common misconceptions about FIFA corruption is that it flourishes because the organization is rolling in money.
In fact, if FIFA were a corporation, its revenue of just more than $1 billion a year wouldn’t get it within a Tim Howard goal kick of the Fortune 500.
6 billion; Blockbuster Video, the 500th company on the list, had revenues more than four times the average for world soccer’s governing body.
By the global scale on which it operates, FIFA is at best a medium-sized outfit.
And it’s the organization’s middlingness, combined with its exposure to much larger economic powers, that determines the peculiar character of its scandals.

FIFA executives tend to be vain bureaucrats and unctuous politicians rather than cutthroat businessmen.
From an economic standpoint, their only real purpose is to control the point of access to the World Cup, from which the organization derives 87 percent of its income.
FIFA’s top executives are thus in a position to be courted around the clock by massive corporations, which want to secure one of the competition’s prized sponsorships, and by governments, which want the prestige of hosting the tournament.
It’s easy to imagine how a sports administrator’s ego would unfurl under these conditions; the majestic, indomitable beard of Chuck Blazer , the American functionary who wrote the report accusing bin Hammam, 2 provides a useful visual aid.
As a result, the FIFA corruption stories that become public — and there are presumably many that don’t — tend to be silly, tawdry, or decadent rather than chilling or deeply outrageous.
They’re just a bit of glitzy filth, the mildew of globalization.
The best recent example of this is the case of Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association and head of England’s 2018 bid.
In May 2010, Triesman was ousted from both roles after a former aide secretly taped him saying that Spain and Russia were trying to bribe World Cup referees.
A year later, as bin Hammam and Blatter were plotting against each other in Zurich, Triesman appeared in London, testifying before a parliamentary committee about the failure of England’s bid.
The location was significant.
Under Europe’s stringent libel laws, making accusations, even against public figures, can lead to heavy penalties.
Speak under parliamentary privilege, however, and you’re immune from legal action.
Triesman thus had the perfect stage from which to take revenge on FIFA.
He cheerfully obliged, offering up a series of anecdotes that were hilarious, unsubstantiated, and off-putting, all in about equal measures.
Best of all was Triesman’s meeting with Nicolás Leoz, the six-term president of the South American soccer confederation.
In the book were facsimiles of the honors Leoz had been given by various countries — knighthoods, photos of streets that had been named after him, and so on.
Instead, Triesman continued, “I was shown the facsimile of his Légion d’honneur.
4 I was then told, through the translator but directly after he had spoken, that he believed that a knighthood from the United Kingdom would be appropriate.
And it was put to me that as a former Foreign Office minister, I must know how these things are organized and could probably achieve it.
I said that it was completely impossible, that we didn’t operate in the United Kingdom like that.
Mr.
Did any of this really happen?
It almost doesn’t matter.
Triesman’s portrait of FIFA as a rogues’ gallery of parasites accorded deeply with what everyone already sensed about the organization.
On the other hand, his portrait of himself as a lion of British rectitude, shocked and outraged by each hint of impropriety, was so absurdly implausible that even if Triesman’s accusations against FIFA weren’t true, FIFA could still be regarded with suspicion simply for consorting with men like Triesman.
5 The whole narrative sank into a soft bottom of rottenness.
Like a scene in a comic novel, it felt detached from reality — something that sounded like the truth told in a way that sounded like lying.
The pivotal moment in the history of FIFA corruption came in the summer of 1974.
That year, West Germany upset Johan Cruyff’s Netherlands at the World Cup; the Jules Rimet trophy, which was actually held by the winners, was retired in favor of the FIFA World Cup trophy, which was awarded only in replica; and João Havelange, the tall, grim-faced head of the Brazilian Sports Confederation, was elected as FIFA’s seventh president.
Under Havelange’s predecessor, the Englishman Sir Stanley Rous, FIFA was not notably corrupt, only racist and Eurocentric.
Rous, who was born during the reign of Queen Victoria, championed values of amateurism; as a young man, he had served as a referee.
As president, he alienated FIFA’s non-European contingent by resisting efforts to expand the World Cup — in the 1966 tournament, there was one spot reserved for Asia and Africa combined — and by supporting apartheid South Africa’s right to a place in world soccer.
6 Rous’ FIFA was hopelessly outmoded, an artifact of the game’s colonialist past.
João Havelange had two insights that, taken together, transformed and modernized FIFA.
The first was that the countries Rous had neglected could form a viable power base.
Havelange toured Africa with the immensely popular Brazilian national team, promised development funds to smaller nations, and lavished attention on regions that had previously been crowded out by traditional soccer giants.
Havelange’s second insight was that the commercial potential of soccer had barely begun to be tapped.
The 1970 World Cup, the first to be broadcast live and in color throughout the developed world, hinted at spectacular possibilities, but Rous’ antique FIFA had done little to exploit them.
At his first dinner as president, Havelange encountered the German businessman Horst Dassler, the son of the founder of adidas.
Dassler, an aggressive, manipulative entrepreneur who was then serving as the CEO of adidas France, had thought a great deal about how to capitalize on the explosion in the popularity of televised sport.
Over a series of meetings, Havelange, Dassler, and Dassler’s partner, Patrick Nally, devised what eventually became the template for modern sports sponsorship.
First, only the very largest multinational companies, whose advertising budgets could bear the load and whose global reach matched the TV audience on offer, should be approached as sponsors.
Second, sponsorship and advertising would be segmented by product type: There could be only one soft drink, one beer, one microelectronics firm, or one financial services company that could be the official World Cup product or supplier.
Third, FIFA would have total control over all forms of TV rights, advertising, stadium space, etc.
Any and all existing deals in a host country would have to go.
Fourth, FIFA itself would not handle the details of the sponsorship and TV deals.
Marketing and TV rights would be handed over for a guaranteed sum of money to an intermediary who would sell them on.
To cover the last part, the selling of TV rights and sponsorships, Dassler created a marketing company called ISL, short for International Sports and Leisure, and established an office across the street from FIFA headquarters in Zurich.
The combined effect of Havelange’s two insights was to covert FIFA into a sort of hydraulic cash-flow machine.
Dassler and Nally brokered deals with huge companies — Coca-Cola was the first to sign on, in 1975.
The money flowed into ISL, which paid FIFA a fixed fee for the rights.
To enjoy exclusive access to the rights, ISL also made off-the-books payments worth tens of millions of dollars to FIFA executives.
7 To preserve the power structure, FIFA ExCo members funneled resources — and ISL money — to the regional confederations that supported them.
The people at the top made deals with big companies, then filtered cash to the people at the bottom in return for the votes that let them make the deals.
Havelange reigned at FIFA for 24 years and kept the machine working through sheer grandiose force of personality.
When he announced his retirement in 1998, the race to succeed him pitted Lennart Johansson, the Swedish president of UEFA, against the oleaginous Blatter, who was then FIFA’s secretary general.
Johansson had a reputation for incorruptibility — it was thought he might open the books.
Blatter was Havelange’s protégé.
Blatter won, 111-80.
The investigative journalist Andrew Jennings records in his book Foul!
Havelange’s allies in Qatar were rumored to have paid $50,000 each to delegates who agreed to vote for Blatter.
In a savory twist, the Qatari bribes that secured Blatter’s election were dealt out by the candidate’s loyal friend, future anticorruption advocate Mohammed bin Hammam.
Swiss law, that wonderfully flexible instrument, didn’t formally prohibit bribery until 2000, and even then nonprofit sporting entities were made exempt.
1, which states unambiguously that “officials may not accept bribes” — but then FIFA operated without a written code of ethics until October 2004.
It’s possible, amazingly, that the worst behavior of the Havelange and Blatter eras was neither illegal nor expressly proscribed by FIFA policy.
Which raises the question again: If FIFA corruption is simply a closed system, detached from reality, a mechanism for assigning World Cup sponsorship rights, and none of the actions it entails are illegal, then where’s the harm?
Surely we aren’t expected to weep when one multibillion-dollar company loses an advertising opportunity because another multibillion-dollar company is better at cheating.
So as long as the games are good, why does it matter if FIFA is corrupt?
One of the most striking venues constructed for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa was Mbombela Stadium, in the Mpumalanga province in the northeast of the country.
Seating just shy of 41,000 people, the stadium rises out of open land, a silver disc ringed by jutting roof supports designed to look like colossal orange giraffes.
This was where tiny New Zealand held Italy, the defending champion, to a draw in one of the most memorable matches of the tournament.
All in all, Mbombela hosted four World Cup games.
The cost to construct the stadium that hosted those four games was initially estimated at about $80 million; the final tally was closer to $140 million.
Construction was funded by public revenues — by taxes.
Two schools were bulldozed to make room for the stadium.
Local politicians in Nelspruit, the provincial capital, began turning up evidence of massive graft surrounding the project.
In 2008, Jimmy Mohlala, the head of the local council, came forward with evidence that an official named Jacob Dladla had conspired with the stadium’s contractors to effectively steal public funds.
The ANC held a meeting to consider the allegations, the outcome of which was that they left the accused, Dladla, unpunished and demanded Mohlala’s resignation.
The ANC has its reasons for taking its decision, which will be communicated to the public in due time,” the party spokesman said.
Mohlala persisted, refusing to resign and announcing that he planned to file charges against a company called Lefika Emerging Equity, which had won the contract to manage the stadium project.
Lefika was co-owned by Bobby Motaung, the heir of the South African soccer dynasty that also controls the powerful Kaizer Chiefs team; its CEO, Chris Grib, had fled the country in 2008 after being implicated in a tax-evasion case.
Mohlala claimed to have evidence that Lefika had forged a government document and committed bank fraud.
Then, on January 4, 2009, two men wearing ski masks showed up at Mohlala’s house.
According to some sources, they started an argument about parking their car.
Then they drew guns and shot Mohlala’s 19-year-old son in the ankle, shot Mohlala in the shoulder, and fled.
Mohlala died on the way to the hospital.
The Mpumalanga police continually promised an arrest that never seemed to come.
They also deflected any speculation that the shooting was World Cup-related.
We don’t talk about politics,” Captain Leonard Hlathi said, declaring “out of order” the assertion that the killing might have been a political reprisal.
8 South African newspapers, however, printed what they claimed were hit lists containing the names of people the contractors and their allies planned to assassinate.
In January 2010, another man on the hit lists, Sammy Mpatlanyane, was shot to death in his bed.
According to the BBC, at least four men were eventually murdered in connection with Mbombela Stadium fraud.
FIFA has been silent about all this.
The past four World Cups to be awarded, representing 16 years of FIFA’s work and tens of billions of dollars in revenue, have charted a line straight down the Democracy Index, from South Africa  30th place  to Brazil  47th  to Russia  107th  to Qatar  137th , where political power is hereditary and homosexuality is a crime.
5 billion the soccer group inhaled from the event.
It’s not that liberal democracies are unwilling to make similar concessions.
But when you’re accustomed to being bribed, exempted, accommodated, and indulged — when you never want to pick up the check — in some ways the worse the partner, the better.
FIFA corruption matters, in other words, not because the integrity of the ExCo makes much difference to the average American or European fan, but because FIFA isn’t a closed system.
Its decisions, however farcical in themselves, open the door for better or worse things to happen elsewhere.
Old men fluttering about knighthoods in Asunción lead to exploitation and murder in South Africa.
For all that they act like minor Dickens villains, FIFA executives are not sequestered in a novel; they impact the real world.
Preparations, as always, are moving ahead for the next World Cup.
Brazil 2014 will be a comprehensive spectacle, soccer’s triumphant return to the country where Nike thinks it began, and the fireworks displays will drop showers of money on FIFA.
The man in charge of the preparations, Ricardo Teixeira, is a stocky 64-year-old Brazilian with a mobster’s neck-wattle and a plutocrat’s blunt eyes.
He is also João Havelange’s former son-in-law.
Teixeira was married to Havelange’s daughter Lúcia for nearly 30 years; they divorced in 1997, the year before Havelange retired.
He was named in both Lord Triesman’s testimony and the BBC Panorama investigation as one of the corrupt eminences of the ExCo, a charge to which he responded, with characteristic subtlety, by vowing to make English soccer’s life “hell” as long as he sat on the committee.
Teixeira’s helming of the World Cup organizing committee has drawn considerable ire in Brazil, where he is widely loathed.
At the qualifying draw in Rio earlier this month, which establishes the matches teams will play to earn entry to the World Cup itself, protesters marched outside carrying signs that read “FORA RICARDO TEIXEIRA”: Ricardo Teixeira Out.
Thousands of the city’s residents are being removed from their homes,” the protestors said in a statement; the government is clearing favelas to make room for tourist-friendly construction.
Football is the beating heart of Brazil, this multicultural country of joy and celebration, blessed with natural beauty and a booming economy.
Beauty and money, production and reproduction, fortune and misfortune and riches.
There are signs that the old Havelange coalition is starting to break apart, that Blatter’s grip on FIFA is weakening.
Bin Hammam turned on him; proposed changes to Swiss law might threaten FIFA’s tax status; the press is forever getting closer to the box of dirty secrets.
Havelange, now 95, is being investigated by the International Olympic Committee for accepting a seven-figure bribe.
Blatter’s strongest reform effort to date — appointing Henry Kissinger and Placido Domingo as anticorruption consultants — has met with widespread derision.
If nothing else, the average age of the ExCo is 64 — surely one of the main reasons FIFA broke its own tradition by awarding two World Cups at once last year.
Some sort of change must be coming.
But Blatter has withstood crises before, including the sudden collapse of ISL in 2001, which revealed yawning holes in FIFA’s books.
Somehow or other, he always seems to emerge at the end, smiling above the rubble and purring that it would be reprehensible to assume he masterminded all this.
This may be because he understands better than anyone, Havelange included, that while FIFA might influence the real world, it is never finally judged there.
Reform movements and protests are local and particular.
FIFA’s plane is abstract and global, the bright, hard everywhere of logos and sponsored theme music.
To thrive, Blatter doesn’t have to make the World Cup a force for good.
He just has to make it look good on TV.

This past May, Mel Brennan wrote a hugely entertaining and bizarre account of working for Blazer at CONCACAF, including strip clubs, massages, and the AMEX Centurion Card.
This past weekend, the investigative journalist Andrew Jennings reported that Blazer is being investigated by the FBI .
In an unrelated coincidence, France hosted the World Cup in 1998.
For instance: Triesman accused Worawi Makudi, the ExCo member from Thailand, of asking him to schedule a friendly match between England and Thailand and to give Makudi the TV rights.
In May 2010, the FA did schedule a friendly match with Thailand, which they canceled in December after Makudi failed to vote for their bid.
Other Rous winners: In 1973, two months after the Pinochet coup in Chile, he ordered the Soviet Union to play a World Cup qualifier against the Chileans in Santiago.
The only problem: The Pinochet regime had been using the stadium as a death camp.
The Soviets refused to play the match.
Rous threw them out of the World Cup.
This was the subject of a trial that took place in Zug, Switzerland in 2008.
The bribe-takers unsurprisingly appear to have included both Nicolás Leoz, he of the many knighthoods, and Ricardo Teixeira.
Last October, Mpumalanga police arrested three suspects in the murder, but subsequently released them for lack of evidence.
In March, the police dismissed two officers who were themselves now seen as suspects in the killing.
The FIFA headquarters in Zurich.
The Swiss-based International Association Football Federation, known by its French initials FIFA, is under siege as it grapples with mounting allegations of bribery and corruption that span the globe and involve millions of dollars.
Over the past decade, allegations that FIFA officials have taken or given bribes or kickbacks have prompted a list of senior soccer figures to resign or be forced out.
S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating some of the allegations.
And a high-profile FIFA investigation is under way into allegations that FIFA officials were paid millions of dollars to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, something Qatari bid officials deny.
Prominent figures inside and outside FIFA have said it is time to take the drastic step of throwing out what they say was a tainted vote that gave Qatar the tournament and hold another ballot.
Among them is Alexandra Wrage, a Canadian lawyer and internationally respected anti-corruption expert who last year walked away from her seat on the FIFA governance committee overseeing the soccer body’s cleanup efforts because she believed FIFA, and its powerful president Sepp Blatter, weren’t serious about real changes.
If they are interested in re-establishing public confidence in the vote , there is only one way to do that now,” said Ms.
Wrage, head of Trace International, an anti-bribery organization based in Annapolis, Md.
They really must have a new vote.
World Cup alone, comes as corporations and governments around the world shift their attitudes toward bribery, a practice that until recently was quietly tolerated as the cost of doing business in certain parts of the world.
S.
Britain with an extraterritorial reach, and even increasing enforcement by the RCMP in Canada, companies around the world have been hiring specialized lawyers and consultants and bringing in internal controls to ensure they do not fall afoul of anti-bribery rules.
But until recently, FIFA – a sprawling global body composed of more than 200 national soccer associations – had done little to keep pace.
Indeed, hands-off Switzerland, where FIFA has its imposing angled-glass headquarters in Zurich, had no legislation covering “private sector” bribery until 2006.
In 2012, recurring scandals over alleged kickbacks and bribery during the past decade finally prompted the appointment of a committee to recommend, and then oversee, governance reforms at FIFA.
Swiss law professor Mark Pieth, chairman of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s working group on bribery, was made its head.
And despite Canada’s indifference to its own national soccer team – currently ranked an abysmal 110th in the world – two well-regarded Canadian anti-corruption experts were appointed to the 13-member panel: Ms.
Wrage and Toronto lawyer James Klotz, a partner at Miller Thomson LLP.
Other seats were taken up by external experts and by prominent soccer figures from around the world.
Mr.
Klotz, who had never seen a professional soccer game, and Ms.
Wrage, who admits she prefers hockey, joined the committee’s other members in recommending a sweeping set of changes for FIFA’s structure and procedures that are designed to remove the temptations for bribery.
The committee released its final report in April, which concluded that more work needed to be done.
FIFA did adopt two key recommendations, naming former New York district attorney Michael Garcia as an independent investigator to look into allegations of bribery, and appointing a German judge and former organized crime prosecutor, Hans-Joachim Eckert, as the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA’s ethics committee.
Mr.
S .
African embassies – is currently probing the explosive allegations that bribery handed the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
He met with Qatari bid officials in Oman this week.
Mr.
Klotz describes the two appointees as “tough-as-nails,” and praises FIFA for taking the steps to investigate the allegations.
He says he believes the world should wait for Mr.
Garcia to report and Mr.
Erckert to issue a ruling before clamouring for a re-vote on Qatar.
It’s really a litmus test almost for FIFA, moving forward,” he said.
But even Mr.
Garcia’s investigation has attracted doubts.
Back in March, reports emerged that at a meeting of FIFA’s powerful executive committee, some members wanted to fire him or block his investigation.
And this week, with his probe due to be completed in a few days and a final report to be submitted to Mr.
Eckert within six weeks, The Guardian reported that Mr.
Garcia is not expected to review the Sunday Times’s massive e-mail and document cache.
This, and the experiences that led her to quit the FIFA governance committee panel last year, have made Ms.
Wrage a skeptic: “It has always been a tactic of FIFA to try to ride these scandals out.
She quit last year, she said, after it became clear to her that FIFA was going to “cherry pick” from the committee’s recommendations.
While Prof.
Pieth’s report says she left due to “time constraints,” she says the full reason is that the fighting necessary to bring about real change at FIFA would simply take more time than she had.
FIFA has avoided some of the panel’s straightforward corporate governance recommendations.
Mr.
Blatter’s salary, for example, remains a secret.
FIFA has balked at including independent directors on its powerful 25-member executive committee, a standard corporate governance practice in the private sector.
FIFA also watered down a recommendation for “integrity checks,” police background checks to weed out organized crime links and screening procedures to ensure FIFA executives were not linked to companies that do business with the soccer body.
FIFA’s checks will instead be conducted by its regional soccer confederations, not by its head office.
It has also delayed a vote on age and term limits for executive committee members.
However, a proposal to bring in age and term limits is on the agenda for delegates from those member associations when FIFA’s congress meets on Wednesday in a Sao Paulo hotel, the day before Brazil takes the pitch against Croatia for the World Cup’s opening match.
Still, with the 78-year-old Mr.
Blatter recently reversing previous suggestions that he would not stand for another term as president, Ms.
Wrage said even this simple proposal could be rendered impotent with grandfathering clauses for existing members, for example.
I am confident whatever the decision, Mr.
Blatter’s long-term goal will be the result,” she said, recounting that he once told her matter-of-factly that in his powerful post at the top of FIFA, he can hop on a plane to any country in the world and be received by the head to state when he lands.
The man at the centre of the most recent bribery storm, Doha-born Mohamed bin Hammam, 65, has a long history as a senior power figure on FIFA’s executive.
In 2011, he initially challenged Mr.
Blatter for the presidency – even promising to clean up corruption – but withdrew just before he was suspended for allegedly offering $1-million in bribes to Caribbean soccer officials to vote for him.
Banned for life in 2012, his penalty was later reversed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport for insufficient evidence.
He later resigned after a FIFA probe found he had violated conflict-of-interest rules.
Now, he faces allegations that he paid $5-million in cash or lavish gifts to senior FIFA officials in order to secure the World Cup for Qatar.
Even without the taint of bribery allegations, Qatar has been a controversial choice.
The extreme heat of the desert country could force the tournament to be rescheduled for the winter.
There are concerns about the deaths of foreign workers in Qatar who face notoriously bad conditions on stadium construction sites, and about the country’s harsh laws against homosexuality.
One of the changes FIFA has approved in the wake of the recent allegations is the removal of the body’s top brass from the final decision on who hosts the World Cup.
For the 2026 World Cup bidding process, the entire 209-member FIFA congress will vote to decide the winner, taking the decision out of the hands of the elite 25-member executive and presumably making it much more difficult to win by making bribes.
But the executive will still make the shortlist.
Recently, Canadian soccer officials – apparently unfazed by the storm of bribery allegations – announced their intention to prepare a bid on the 2026 World Cup, hoping to build on a successful women’s event going ahead here next year.
S.
Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati has said his country – which finished second to Qatar in the 2010 vote – would not bid on another World Cup until voting reforms that include more transparency and tighter rules are in place.
Victor Montagliani, president of the Canadian Soccer Association and a delegate to FIFA’s congress this week, said the changes FIFA has made have already improved the process.
And he said everyone should wait for the results of the investigation into the Qatar allegations before passing judgment.
Those are allegations.
And there’s somebody who’s now in charge of looking into that whole process.
And until he comes out with his report, I think it would be irresponsible to comment on that,” Mr.
Montagliani said, adding that the officials implicated in previous scandals who were part of the regional soccer federation in which Canada is a member were thrown out.
Mr.
Klotz, the Toronto lawyer who recently finished his work on FIFA’s governance committee, says FIFA deserves credit for what it has done.
He notes that it has created an independent audit committee to look at its books and pledged to allow the committee’s head to attend executive meetings.
But Mr.
Klotz, who like Ms.
Wrage, advises companies on their anti-bribery procedures, said that all the rules in the world won’t work until an organization changes its culture.
Whether FIFA can achieve this, he said, remains to be seen.
Ms.
Wrage says that unless Swiss authorities decide to pursue FIFA, the only way the organization will change is if the multinational companies that sponsor the World Cup decide to withhold their millions.
Every time there’s a new scandal, I say, this is is really going to be the last straw, and then there’s another one,” she said.
If the sponsors are going to keep paying, and the fans are going to keep attending the games, it does make some sense of FIFA’s sense of perfect impunity.
At a press conference in Sao Paulo on Thursday, Mr.
Blatter would say little about the Qatar investigation.

This is not new; from the moment Qatar was named the 2022 World Cup hosts, allegations have been made that FIFA committee members had accepted millions of dollars in bribes to make it happen.
Some of those executives were even banned or quit in disgrace!
So it s not outside the realm of probability.
The  evidence  is of the isn t that curious?
Platini, the magazine reports, attended a dinner with then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Qatar s crown prince, and a representative of French club Paris Saint-Germain.
This  secret meeting  was held nine days before the World Cup vote.
Here are the dots, which you re asked to connect: PSG, Sarkozy s favorite team, was sold to the Qatar Investment Authority, overseen by the crown prince.
Platini s son was hired by the Qatar Investment Authority.
Al Jazeera, owned by the Qatar royal family, launched a sports network that now owns broadcast rights to the French League and UEFA tournaments.
There is some actual evidence to back up France Football s general claims of bribery.
An internal email from FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke saying that Qatar  bought the 2022 World Cup .
A former employee on the Qatar bid says two African executives, including African Confederation President Issa Hayatou, were bought off in exchange for their votes.
Former FIFA media chief Guido Tognoni says bribery was rampant.
President Sarkozy would never have asked me to vote for Qatar 2022 because he knows that I m my own man.
2022 is nearly a decade awayâ€”we re seriously running the risk of scandal fatigue.
And we haven t even involved Sepp Blatter or Russia yet.

John Oliver FIFA Rant Amazing!
John Oliver compared his 2014 World Cup revelations to finding out how the sausage is made in a factory.
The Brit revealed that he is excited for the international tournament, which only happens every four years.
But he admitted that all of the scandal surrounding FIFA has somewhat tempered his enthusiasm.
FIFA is a comically grotesque organization,” John Oliver said during his Last Week Tonight rant.
You do it mainly so you can watch the horrified expression on people’s faces.
From there, John Oliver ranted about FIFA’s various illicit practices.
For starters, while Brazil spent billions of dollars to host the 2014 World Cup, much of the money made from the tournament will go back to FIFA, not the nation’s government.
Brazil, let me put this in terms you might understand,” John Oliver continued during his FIFA World Cup rant.
Think of money as pubic hair, and FIFA as wax.
Other topics of conversation included FIFA’s $250 million tax exemption  “Somewhere, Wesley Snipes is going ‘So soccer was the answer’” Oliver quipped , and the organization’s insistence on selling alcohol in World Cup stadiums, even though this violated Brazilian law.
FIFA even got Brazil to pass a so-called “Budweiser Bill” allowing for these new beer sales  Budweiser is a major sponsor of FIFA .
And, of course, John Oliver spent plenty of time talking about the corruption and bribery scandals within FIFA.
Most recently, Sunday Times in England reported that former FIFA vice president Mohamed bin Hammam bribed several officials to vote for Qatar as host of the 2022 World Cup.
Bin Hammam, himself a Qatari, was previously kicked out of FIFA following corruption charges.
Qatar shockingly won the World Cup bid, even though temperatures can reach up to  50 degrees Celsius  122 degrees Farenheit  during the summer, when the tournament takes place.
You are hosting the World Cup somewhere where soccer cannot physically be played,” John Oliver continued.
FIFA’s decision to put the World Cup in Qatar is also having deadly consequences.
A March report from the International Trade Union Confederation concluded that 1,200 migrant workers have already died in Qatar while building infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup.
That number could go up to 4,000 before the start of the tournament.
The Qatar World Cup is shaping up to be the most deadly Middle East construction project since [the Egyptian pyramids,” John Oliver concluded in his FIFA rant.

LONDON –  A former member of FIFA s executive committee was accused Sunday of making payments totaling $5 million to senior football officials in return for support for Qatar s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.
Britain s Sunday Times said it has obtained millions of secret documents proving that Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari who used to be FIFA vice president, was lobbying on his country s behalf ahead of the vote in December 2010.
Under a front-page headline of  Plot to buy the World Cup,  the newspaper alleged that Mr.
Bin Hammam made dozens of payments to top football officials in Africa as well as Reynald Temarii and Jack Warner, the former FIFA executive committee members for Oceania and CONCACAF.
The allegations come less than two weeks before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and bring fresh scrutiny on the 2010 vote, which awarded football s biggest tournament to the tiny desert state and currently is under investigation by FIFA s independent ethics prosecutor.
The Sunday Times said that Mr.
Bin Hamman declined to respond to the allegations and that members of Qatar s bid committee denied any link to the former FIFA official, saying he played no secret role in their campaign.
Qatari organizers didn t immediately respond to the Associated Press  request for comment.
Mr.
Bin Hammam, one of the most controversial figures in FIFA s recent history, is no longer a committee member of world football s governing body after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed campaign for its presidency in 2011.
The Sunday Times is alleging, however, that he exploited his position at the heart of FIFA when he was an executive committee member to help to secure votes from key members of its 24-man ruling committee that helped Qatar win the right to host the World Cup.
Japan, South Korea and Australia.
While addressing FIFA s African and Asian confederations on Monday, FIFA president Sepp Blatter seized the opportunity to mount a defense against the most recent and damning allegations that Qatar bribed its way to the 2022 World Cup.
He did this by accusing all of his critics of being racist.
A recent report by The Sunday Times laid out a smoking paper trail alleging that Qatari FIFA vice president Mohamed bin Hammam made payments to international soccer officials around the world in order to secure votes in favor of Qatar s World Cup bid.
Four of the officials that he allegedly bribed were from FIFA s African confederation, and Sepp Blatter thinks that if you point that out, you re just being racist.
Once again there is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup.
Sepp Blatter, man.
This goon doesn t have an ounce of shame in his entire body.
This isn t even the first time that Blatter has deployed the  You re the real racist!  strategy while trying to deflect attention from his organization s heinous and rampant corruption.
Back in September, Blatter tried to tell us that anyone who pointed out what a hilariously dumb idea it is to play soccer when it s 120 degrees outside was just being a Euro-centric imperialist .
This man is the president of a billion-dollar international organization, and he wields the rhetorical tactics of an internet commenter .
This man can fuck himself.

Soccer’s governing body increased the risk of World Cup referees being approached with bribes by naming the officials five months before this year’s event in Brazil , FIFA’s former head of security said.
The organizers in January identified the referees for the tournament, which starts June 12.
Revealing their identities early gives time for criminal approaches by match-fixers, said Chris Eaton , who’s now the director of sports integrity at the Doha-based International Centre for Sport Security.
Of course it carries a risk,” Eaton said by e-mail.
FIFA has appointed 25 refereeing teams.
All referees including Howard Webb , the English official who oversaw the 2010 final where Spain beat the Netherlands in South Africa, have signed integrity forms and attend educations seminars on match-fixing risks.
In the past few years several match-fixing cases spanning the globe have come to light.
A network based in Singapore is alleged to have been responsible for rigging or attempting to fix 680 local, national and international matches across the world between 2008 and 2011, according to European police body Europol.
Criminal groups are well organized and are likely to identify the referees whether or not their names have been made public, according to Mutschke.
If you are a very competent criminal, you will find out who will be” overseeing the matches,’’ Mutschke said.
They all have a history internationally.
Eaton says FIFA appoints referees well ahead of the World Cup for “training and deployment” reasons, though making their identities public is unnecessary.
FIFA should change its system to make identities confidential, “with the referees being obligated not to talk about the appointment before the World Cup,” Eaton said.
He says other steps to reduce the risk would be to appoint more officials than necessary and announce referees just 30 minutes before games start.
In Brazil referees will be appointed two days before matches.
Mutschke said certain World Cup games carry more risk than others, with the biggest focus on the last group-stage games when many teams have already been eliminated from the tournament.
FIFA found no fixed matches at the last World Cup.
However, it is looking at games played in the build-up by 2010 host South Africa which it says appear to have been manipulated.
The country’s soccer federation signed an agreement for a company set up by convicted fixer Wilson Raj Perumal to provide referees for those games.
South Africa beat Guatemala 5-0 and then Colombia 2-1, with the officials awarding three penalty kicks in each game.
Mutschke, a 33-year police veteran, says a lot of preventative work is going on, including education programs for FIFA’s 209 member associations.
Some of those have had senior officials expelled by FIFA for corruption while question marks exist over the integrity of others.
Among the most high profile examples was in 2011 when Indonesia ’s soccer federation continued to be led by an official even after he was sentenced to jail after being convicted of graft.
When I was a police officer I had certain countries where I do know the corruption of the police is pretty high,” Mutschke said.
I could skip the case or I could go there and discuss with them to help my case.
It is not unusual that you work together with people who do not have the best reputation at all.
Press spacebar to pause and continue.
Press esc to stop.

I m talking, of course, about the snowballing debacle at FIFA , the global organization that governs the planet s most popular sport, soccer.
On Tuesday, the anti-corruption group Transparency International  TI  demanded that FIFA delay its June 1 presidential election so that the organization can get the bottom of the vote-buying controversy.
Among other things, Transparency International is demanding that FIFA implement new rules to combat corruption, appoint an ombudsman, and review its ethics code.
Free and fair elections cannot take place when there is a suspicion that voters may have been swayed,  a TI official said in a statement.  Two major figures in football politics have been suspended recently for alleged vote-buying.
FIFA s crisis began when the US s only representative to the organization, Chuck Blazer, accused two FIFA colleagues of offering cash bribes to as many as 25 delegates to secure their support in the vote on which nations would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments, the game s biggest competition.
The two officials accused of allegedly bribing delegates no less than Jack Warner, the head of soccer in North and Central America, and Mohammed Bin Hammam, the head of soccer in Asia.
Notably, Bin Hammam was the only challenger to incumbent Sepp Blatter in tomorrow s presidential election, but Bin Hammam s decision to drop out leaves Blatter the only candidate.
Qatar has also been accused of buying the rights to host the 2022 World Cup, which Qatari officials reject.
Blatter, the 75-year-old Swiss who s running for his fourth term as FIFA president, has been pulled into the scandal as well, accused of turning a blind eye to the alleged bribery.
TI isn t the only group to demand a delay in the FIFA election.
England s Football Association has joined TI in calling for a postponement of the election, demanding that an independent official step in and make recommendations on how to increase the transparency and integrity of FIFA s internal workings.
FA said in a statement.

Nine years before the 2022 Qatar World Cup, the country is being criticized for everything from logistics to bribery to human rights abuses.
It s a burgeoning disaster.
Here s why.
1.
They re allegedly using  modern-day slavery  to build the infrastructure.
The Guardian had a big report this week about the mistreatment of Nepalese migrant workers in Qatar.
From June to August, at least 44 Nepalese died in Qatar from working construction, the Guardian reports.
2.
It s 120 degrees in summer so they ll probably have to play the tournament in winter.
During the bidding process, Qatar said they would host the event in summer.
Now pretty much everyone has abandoned that idea , and FIFA could make it official soon.
3.
Homosexuality is illegal there.
4.
There were widespread bribery allegations during the bidding process.
5.
There are no stadiums.
Entire cities that are necessary to host the event don t exist yet.
It will cost Qatar $220 billion to host the World Cup.
They don t have the stadiums, hotels, or infrastructure to the host the event, so they have to build it all from scratch before 2022.
5 billion.
The city that will host the final, Lusail City, doesn t exist yet.
7.
The futuristic air-conditioned stadiums that Qatar promised to build aren t actually possible.
Qatar promised to build space-age stadiums that had unprecedented cooling technology so that the event could be held during the summer.
But after they won the bid, they scrapped that plan.
8.
Playing it in winter will totally screw up the European leagues.
For many of these huge global stars, the club matters more than the country.
While the World Cup is a huge event, postponing the English, Spanish, and Italian leagues will be a huge headache for everyone involved.
9.
FIFA will have to renegotiate all the TV contracts.
FIFA is holding secret talks with television networks from across the world in case the World Cup is moved to the winter, the Telegraph reports .
Fox paid a record $425 million for the next two tournaments under the assumption that it would be played in summer and not clash with the NFL.
10.
It ll get drowned out by football in America.
The World Cup is the only time when mainstream America pays attention to soccer.
If it has to compete with the NFL it d be a disaster, especially if it s held in January and goes up against the playoffs.
11.
They probably won t sell beer in the stadiums.
There are select hotels and bars in Doha where you re allowed to drink.
But you can t have alcohol or be drunk in public.
It will be the most sober World Cup ever.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter holds an official 2014 FIFA World Cup soccer ball during a media conference in Sao Paulo June 5, 2014.
The 2014 World Cup will be held in 12 cities in Brazil from June 12 to July 13.
He made this declaration while addressing the African and Asian confederations of FIFA, who were holding their own conferences before FIFA’s annual conference.
Two weeks prior, The Sunday Times found overwhelming evidence that Qatari FIFA Vice President Mohamed bin Hammam gave bribes to multiple FIFA officials to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar.
He gave bribes mainly to members of the African confederation, which Blatter is focusing on, reports the Sydney Morning Herald .
He called the accusers “racist,” adding, “Once again there is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup.
Ho hum.
Sepp Blatter really never had a real job.
Like a rock star.
Steve Amoia recently had the opportunity to interview respected investigative journalist and film maker, Mr.
Andrew Jennings, whose recent book, “Foul!
The Secret World of FIFA : Bribes, Vote Rigging and Ticket Scandals” painted FIFA in a hue that many at the world governing body would have rather not seen.
Mr.
Jennings is one of the few journalists who have written extensively about the inner workings at FIFA.
Let’s discuss your most recent book on FIFA.
You spent seven years on this highly acclaimed work, and FIFA President, Joseph “Sepp” Blatter attempted to place a global ban on your book in a Swiss court.
Let’s say that a person knew very little about FIFA.
Could you provide us with a scouting report or dossier about one of the most powerful organizations in international sports?
It’s free on the web site and I hope you rushed to buy it!
There’s always two stories at these big international sport organizations like the IOC and FIFA.
There is the story about themselves, how wonderful they are, how they care about the athletes, and then you find out about the kickbacks, find out about the immoral activities, if I could toss in, there was the scandal in America that broke in 1988 between the IOC, and the way they shook down the good old boys in Utah, I wrote books, I testified in front of Senator John McCain, the Senate Commerce Committee, in 1999, because I was the only one who could really explain what had gone wrong.
The problem with the big federations is, you know, we all know about if you are not accountable to somebody, your partner in life, the police or priests, whatever it is in life, you should know that if you do something wrong, as your mother told you, you’ll get found out.
But what you have with FIFA and the IOC is that you have a small group of reporters desperate not to alienate them because they need access to write stories about the head of the IOC or Sepp Blatter of FIFA.
Actually, you don’t want them to talk to you because they are not going to tell you the truth.
I discovered with FIFA how deep the corruption was, I got into it in late 2000, 2001.
Perhaps a background story might be interesting to listeners.
I spent a dozen years investigating the IOC.
I have a criminal record because Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC President, is a Fascist, I mean, like you know, Hitler, a guy who puts his right arm out in front and marches in jack boots, he was a Franco-Fascist in Spain in 1939 up until the time Franco died in 1975.
I revealed his background, I got photographs of him wearing his Fascist uniform, and giving that horrid right hand salute as late as 1974, and he went to court in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is located, said it was all untrue, and they said how could this wonderful man, all that is moral in sport, turn bad?
So Andrew Jennings gets five days suspended jail sentence.
You could be the best journalist in the world, but you know when they put in jail, you are getting it right.
As part of investigating corruption in America, you got to know where the money came from.
Most of the money for the Olympics and the World Cup came from a company based in Switzerland called ISL: International Sport and Leisure.
Most of us, my German friends and other researchers, knew that ISL paid bribes to FIFA, international track and field, and to the IOC to get fantastic contracts.
Imagine having the exclusive marketing contract for the soccer World Cup?
Think how much money you are going to make 25% percent on?
Now it is slowly triggering a change.
There may be more.
I got a call from a contact and he said Andrew, ISL is going bankrupt.
I said are you sure?
He said they’ve screwed up and going bankrupt.
Now when a company goes bankrupt, a liquidator comes from one of the big accounting firms who have no politics, no preferences, and wants to liquidate to pay off creditors.
And I started a relationship with the liquidator.
If you look at my web site, some of it has already arrived in court.
They got named in a Swiss court, not FIFA, but 70 million dollars in pounds, double that in dollars these days.
Past bribes and it goes on and on and Sepp Blatter is in the crosshairs of the investigators.
It was not triggered until seven years ago because there was not evidence of bribes.
What journalists should know and too many don’t realize this, is look at any organization that you think is corrupt, whether it’s a sports or political organization, whatever, if you think they are corrupt, it is the guys at the top who’ll be corrupt.
The bulk of the employees at FIFA are humble, work for honest wages, but work for a guy like Blatter who will fire at will… You have to get them to trust you… Not many trust journalists but I am a different type.
There’s the documents.
There are all sorts of ways.
In forty years in this business, I’ve never let a source down.
No source has ever been detected… I know all the tricks of the trade to disguise where I get stuff from.
Young journalists or anyone who wants to investigate corruption, know that there are good people with mortgages, bills to pay, if you get them to say “This isn’t right, help me,” they’ll help you.
Sepp Blatter has been President of FIFA since 1998.
What was his background in business and or sports marketing, along with his ascent to power at FIFA?
Sepp Blatter really never had a real job.
Like a rock star.
And he’ll never have a real job again.
Blatter studied Business Administration in Lausanne which is in South Switzerland.
He did get a real job for about a year with the Swiss Tourist Board.
Then he got a job with a Swiss watch firm as a PR man.
In 1974, just after the Winter Olympic Games, he was recruited by FIFA.
He has never worked anywhere else.
He was a technical man, then was in marketing, then became General Secretary and worked with Joao Havelange from Brasil, who he deposed in 1998, he became President in a rigged election.
I’ve got the documents how they rigged the election, how the bribes were paid, that’s the practice at FIFA.
They’re dirty.
The football, the football you like to watch is clean most of the time.
They’re dirty.
The Sunday Times, where you once worked, said that you were shown the red card by FIFA, and barred from their press conferences.
Could you tell us about the last time you posed a question to President Blatter in 2004 during the African Cup of Nations, and what have been other high level reactions to your book?
The only time I get to ask Sepp Blatter questions is by looking for him on the street.
He got more and more irritated as I was writing the book.
I did articles for the London newspapers.
I had documents and questions.
I talked about the secret $200,000 bonus he got one year.
He banned me, he put it on the FIFA web site, it’s in the book, that they were going to sue me for writing fiction.
That’s funny because I had a sworn statement from the previous director of finance.
It’s true.
So, since April 2005, I am the only reporter in the world who isn’t allowed to get near Sepp Blatter to ask a simple question.
Because I’ve got the documents, and he doesn’t want other journalists to say ‘Mr.
It is very embarrassing.
So, in 2004, I ended up going to the African Cup of Nations, it was interesting, I managed to get the neck plastic, the accreditation, for where his press conference was staged.
He was going on and on.
So I asked him about a million francs, that would be about $600,000, bribe in FIFA’s bank account that should have gone to Joao Havelange, and he just froze.
He realized what I was getting to.
Then I asked about President Havelange.
Blatter replied, ‘Well, well, we are not here to talk about this.
He wouldn’t answer the question which is very important legally for a journalist.
BBC’s Panoroma, BBC’s blue chip program, can you imagine the best of CBS’s 60 Minutes running for 30 or 40 minutes, very big investigations, beautifully filmed, and we tried to get an interview with Blatter, just before the last World Cup, to ask him about corruption, and the bribes, and he wouldn’t be interviewed.
Now, if you go up to someone on a public highway, if you behave properly, don’t touch them, you can approach them to ask things.
It’s a skill I’ve developed over the years.
So I had a much-traveled crew and waited for Blatter outside of FIFA House in Zurich, as they say in English slang, like a ferret out of a drain pipe.
I asked fantastic questions about the bribes.
And he went silent.
His faced turned red and he said ‘You know.
You’re a journalist.
I said no, I’m just a reporter.
You tell me.
Was President Havelange one of them?
In November 2005, Swiss fraud detectives raided FIFA House in Zurich and obtained documents from the offices of President Blatter, along with his General Secretary, Urs Linsi.
FIFA’s document archives.
Could you explain this incident in 2005, along with your own findings?
It’s a running saga.
It’s not like a war or however you’d like to tell it.
It is going on every single day.
Since 2001, evidence of bribes were found, I reported in 2002 that it went to an Investigative Magistrate, similar to a District Attorney in America, and the investigation started in a little Swiss canton, think of it like a State, there is a picture of Blatter on my web site about it, none of us knew about this, it was a very secretive investigation, and suddenly we heard that the investigation was over, we were waiting for a trial date, and the Magistrate, Thomas Hildbrand whom I am certain is honest, determined, loyal, I thought, he was going after the gangsters, he is going to raid FIFA House, but the surprising thing is that you never read about this in the newspapers.
Too much is based upon press releases.
And that happened, they didn’t want to admit to it, and I tried to publish it.
It was absolute fact, and that investigation is still going on.
And a second investigation is really interesting because that is the one that could put Herr Blatter in jail.
Because the allegation that the Swiss Magistrate is looking into is the way that the liquidator of the bankrupt marketing company demanded that certain FIFA executives repay the bribes that they pocketed in order to give the contracts.
Yes, they were repaid subsequently, but not by the victims, but the money came out of FIFA.
Now that is of course a fraudulent use of FIFA funds.
Can’t say it happened yet but that is being investigated.
Hildbrand has told me about it himself, I have a press release he put out, which was never published due to influence of deep pockets, but the fact of life is as we talk now, skilled fraud detectives in Switzerland are investigating the allegation and are doing it for three years now.
Which is coming up on the third anniversary of that raid with the allegation that FIFA’s money was used to repay the bribes.
Now, if they indict Blatter, they would be cutting the head off of the serpent.
So it would be a staggering chance.
Hildbrand didn’t get a very good result in court but he got a result.
And we have our fingers crossed.
It’s awful.
In America, the soccer Federation won’t do anything to clean up corruption in FIFA.
The mice won’t squeak.
You guys are out of CONCACAF.
Chuck Blazer and Jack Warner in Trinidad, and Blazer, some might not know, was accused by a judge of lying, he lied to a court in Manhattan, in FIFA’s case, over MasterCard activity, very critical activities.
We know that Jack Warner is the biggest ticket racketeer in the world.
Where are the brave people of American football  soccer  who say we want nothing to do with these scum?

GENEVA  AP   – Former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam won his appeal against a lifetime ban but failed to clear his name in an election bribery case on Thursday.
Tthe Court of Arbitration for Sport says its panel upheld Mohamed bin Hammam s appeal because of lack of evidence and was not convinced he is innocent of corruption.
Tthe Court of Arbitration for Sport says its panel upheld Mohamed bin Hammam s appeal because of lack of evidence and was not convinced he is innocent of corruption.
The Qatari official scored a victory at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which lifted his life ban from football imposed by FIFA for allegedly bribing voters during his challenge to Sepp Blatter last year.
However, the court panel refused to declare Bin Hammam innocent of corruption.
It simply overturned the ban because a FIFA probe led by former FBI director Louis Freeh  s agency failed to find conclusive evidence.
Despite his win, Bin Hammam faces further legal battles.
Bin Hammam faces new charges of bribery at the Asian Football Confederation , where he was president up until the election scandal.
The AFC claimed this week financial mismanagement by Bin Hammam was revealed in a forensic audit of its accounts.
So instead of trying to return to office, he told the BBC s World Service on Thursday that he could simply walk away.
My wish now is just to quit and retire,  Bin Hammam told the World Football program.  I ve served football for 42 years.
FIFA responded to the CAS verdict  with concern , saying it will ask its newly appointed independent prosecutor Michael J.
Garcia to re-examine the case.
FIFA said in a statement.
Bin Hammam s victory at CAS will only partially restore his shattered reputation.
The panel, which was split 2-1 in his favor,  is not making any sort of affirmative finding of innocence in relation to Mr. Bin Hammam,  the court said.
It is more likely than not that Mr.
May 2011.
FIFA got evidence from Caribbean whistleblowers who said they were offered $40,000 cash bribes during the 63-year-old Qatari s electioneering visit.
Bin Hammam denied wrongdoing, claiming Blatter helped orchestrate a scandal to guarantee his election victory unopposed a few weeks later.
Thursday s ruling followed a two-day hearing in April at the court in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Bin Hammam, who refused to attend FIFA hearings which enforced the life ban, did not attend or testify.
Blatter gave evidence by video link from FIFA headquarters in Zurich.
FIFA s failed prosecution used evidence gathered by Freeh s team.
It found  substantial credible evidence that cash was offered to and accepted  by Caribbean Football Union delegates after Bin Hammam made his election pitch at a Port of Spain hotel .
FIFA s code of ethics prohibits officials receiving any cash gifts, yet Caribbean officials were given brown envelopes stuffed with piles of $100 bills.
On Thursday, the CAS panel published its dissatisfaction with the quality of evidence.
Elected to lead Asian football in 2002, Bin Hammam launched his bid to lead football s governing body last year just months after helping Qatar win 2022 World Cup hosting rights.
Bin Hammam and Blatter were locked in a tight race for the presidency and 25 CFU countries were thought to hold the balance of power among the 208 FIFA member nations.
Whistleblowers testified that FIFA vice president Jack Warner , the longtime strongman of Caribbean football, told them he advised Bin Hammam to bring cash instead of formal gifts to the meeting.
Warner said feels vindicated by the CAS ruling.
Warner, who refused to be investigated by FIFA and instead resigned his positions with the sporting body.
Warner is a senior government minister in Trinidad and Tobago, and opposition politicians have repeatedly called for his removal over the corruption allegations.
The new Asian allegations against Bin Hammam, including bribery and mismanagement of commercial contracts, block him from an immediate return to his office in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia.
The AFC imposed a 30-day suspension on him this week.
He is also prevented from retaking his seat at FIFA s high table.
Bin Hammam has represented Asia on FIFA s executive committee since 1996.
He was elected AFC president in 2002, and was serving his final four-year mandate when the FIFA election scandal rocked world football.
United Arab Emirates Football Association President Yousuf al-Sarkal called for the AFC to reinstate its leader.
This is to be fair to the man,  al-Sarkal, who is a member of the AFC s executive board, told The Associated Press.  He has gone through enough of allegations and accusations.
Bin Hammam had once been Blatter s close ally and worked as a campaign manager for his previous FIFA election victories in 1998 and 2002.

Qatari Emir Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, left, and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, right, hold the World Cup trophy at FIFA s headquarters in Zurich on Dec.
After a secret ballot of 22 delegates in Zurich, on Thursday, Dec.
2, FIFA, soccer s governing body, awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively.
The verdicts came amid allegations of corruption and bribery ahead of the pivotal vote, with English and American commentators feeling particularly aggrieved.
But TIME sees geopolitical trends at work in the success of the Russian and Qatari bids.
S.
2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Besides being home to the world s most popular and lucrative soccer league, England has long cultivated an overblown sense of ownership of the game, never ceasing to point out that soccer was created by the English and that it spread throughout the world with their 19th century agents of empire.
And in keeping with its tradition of talking up the team s improbable chances on the field every four years, the British press created the impression that hosting the 2018 World Cup was England s divine right.
S.
America boasts the largest pool of recreational soccer players, an overabundance of stadiums and the world s most multicultural fan base.
But the inherent allure of both nations  in all arenas  has waned of late, not least because of recession and the shift of economic power toward emerging countries.
FIFA s verdict  England s bid received a measly two votes out of 22  and one of them was from its own delegate  is in small part a mark of that decline.
Who Needs Democracy?
Both Russia and Qatar are ruled by strong, uncompromising governments  one steered by post-Soviet apparatchiks with the tacit backing of a tycoon oligarchy, the other the hereditary bequest of a family that can trace itself back to pre-Islamic times.
When the head honchos in Moscow or Doha set out to do something, they have a way of imposing their will  even if the Russian record of getting the trains running on time is a little spotty .
Not so for real democracies.
South Africa s preparations for what was to be a remarkable 2010 World Cup were repeatedly called into question in the face of strike threats and other logistical inefficiencies that can be commonplace in societies where dissent is part of the social fabric.
The chaos that preceded India s Commonwealth Games this year turned New Delhi into a laughingstock  particularly when held up against the shimmering example of authoritarian Beijing s 2008 Olympics.
With the recent boom of the Chinese and Russian economies, the appeal of a more authoritarian path to economic development and prosperity has gained some traction in the developing world.
Who needs a totally free press or fair elections to guarantee a good show?
S.
WikiLeaked cables.
Media observers who suggested, ahead of Thursday s vote, that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin s decision to stay away from Zurich portended a setback for Russia s bid clearly missed the point: when the winners were announced, the cameras moved in close on the smiling face of the Russian bid s key patron, Roman Abramovich.
Abramovich, of course, is a private citizen of Russia who occasionally finds himself in London.
He s also the 50th richest man in the world, according to Forbes, having amassed a fortune in oil and aluminum interests in the rough and tumble of Russia s postcommunist privatization of state assets, in the process becoming one of the country s most powerful oligarchs.
In 2003, he acquired the London soccer club Chelsea and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in its success.
He has also invested heavily in Russian soccer; for example, he got the legendary Dutch coach Guus Hiddink hired to run the national team and personally payed Hiddink s wages.
England s bid, fronted by soccer icon David Beckham and two representatives of the state  Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron , garnered just one vote besides its own in the first round, vs.
Russia s nine.
Perhaps Abramovich s was the more persuasive presence.
FIFA s decisionmaking was never exactly a barometer of geopolitical power; Thursday s vote suggests that, more than ever, it follows the money.
Russia s 2018 World Cup will take place in stadiums flung across a sprawling expanse of 1,500 miles  2,400 km , from the Polish border to the Urals.
Qatar s will be the tiniest in the tournament s history  the country is 1,100 sq.
2,800 sq km  smaller than Connecticut.
But both bids were bankrolled by energy resources.
Abramovich has plowed billions of his Siberian-oil wealth into the sport, while other powerful state energy companies, like Gazprom, have considerable investments in soccer at home.
S.
During the financial crisis, the investment arm of Qatar s secretive sovereign wealth fund was able to splash some $30 billion on ailing Western banks, and it has a diverse portfolio of assets across the globe.
A small chunk of its cash surplus will now go toward realizing Qatar s surreal, futuristic vision for its 2022 World Cup.
K.
The ability of the host country to provide security for hundreds of thousands of sports tourists has long been a key factor in deciding where FIFA stages its flagship tournament.
By that measure, Russia still looks a little dicey.
Extremists from Chechnya and other restive territories in the Caucasus have repeatedly targeted public spaces in Moscow and other major Russian cities in massive terrorist attacks over the past decade.
And those conflicts remain very much alive despite often brutal crackdowns by Russian security forces.
Yet FIFA has put its faith in the ability of those security forces to keep the tournament safe.
The World Cup is about to kick off in Brazil, but FIFA is scrambling to save the 2022 game in Qatar that is caught up in a bribery scandal.
Mark Phillips reports.
Beginning in 2012, many of Brazil’s major cities such as Goiânia, Natal, Porto Alegre, São Paulo saw an increase in bus and train fare costs of about 30 centavos per ride .
Initially, this set off small scale protests, which the government tried to quell by “cancelling” taxes on bus fares.
But this failed to stop an increase in bus fares, which set off perhaps FIFA’s worst nightmare on the eve of the 2013 Confederations Cup, which was supposed to be the Brazilian Football Confederation’s coming out party for the 2014 World Cup .
Protesters hurl rocks during a demonstration in Belo Horizonte in June 2013.
Organized using social media, over 2 million people protested in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Goiânia, Manaus, Brasilia, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Natal, Recife, and Cuiabá, among others.
In addition to being Brazil’s largest cities, these cities are distributed throughout the country, so were chosen as venues for the 2014  World Cup.
Thus, these protests signaled a deep dissatisfaction with both the Brazilian Government and FIFA, perhaps foreshadowing similar events in 2014 when the world’s gaze will be be on Brazil.
Corruption in Brazil is a pervasive social problem.
This is not surprising- Brazil is quickly developing country that has seen over 40 million people lifted out of poverty in just the last decade.
And like other growing nations, it faces the problems of corruption, as poorly paid government officials take bribes to supplement their income.
Before we start out discussion on the corruption that led to the 2013 protests, we must make clear that the corruption you see in the country is not any more extreme than what is seen in similarly developing nations such as Turkey and India, which saw their own anticorruption protests recently.
But corruption is an undeniable part of Brazilian politics and life.
This is especially true in the highest levels of government; succeeding administrations have used government money to pay for pet projects, handing out contracts to friends and family in return for a cut of the profits.
Over the last few years, Brazil has been rocked by the mensalão scandal .
This was essentially a vote buying scandal, where the ruling PT Party was paying certain congressional opponents a monthly stipend for their vote.
Since Brazilian politics is closely intertwined with the media and business, this quickly enmeshed many of the leading figures of Brazilian society.
The President, Lula  Da Silva,  was implicated by involvement of his chief of staff, José Dirceu, and his government almost collapsed.
This was, however, only one of many scandals that have plagued Brazil recently.
During the 1st decade of the 2000s, Brazil was picked as the host for several important sporting events.
It was picked as the host for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, which is a tournament for the best recent winners of the six continental championships and the winners of the world cup.
In 2004, Brazil was selected as the host of the 2014 World Cup.
And in 2008, Rio De Janeiro was picked as the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
The problem is that the cost to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup is expected to be 14 billion dollars at the very least  , which is about three times what South Africa Spent just 4 years ago.
This is a staggering amount in a nation that only spends 37 billion dollars on education.
Investments in stadiums and hotels benefit the construction companies, many of are among the PT Worker’s party’s biggest campaign donors.
Additionally, much needed infrastructure projects are being ignored.
Massive stadiums are being built in cities with no large professional teams- the cities of Manaus and Cuiabá are building large stadium with no plans for any future tenants.
The money earmarked for infrastructure projects is being spent on widening roads, thoroughfares, and viaducts.
Brazilians, on the other hand, largely use public transport, so this infrastructure push is designed for visiting tourists, not the average Brazilian.
Much needed public transportation projects have been put on hold as the nation rushed to cater to the World Cup.
These projects have also been plagued by budget irregularities, poor construction, and lax workplace safety.
The Arena Amazonas in Manaus, Maracanã in Rio and in the stadium of Brasilia have been exposed to be well over budget, and Brazil has thrown more money at these projects in lieu of cracking down on the corruption there.
Money has been spent on a 140 million dollar aquarium in Fortaleza when that state was facing a massive drought .
In November 2013, 2 workers died when a crane collapsed on them Itaquerão stadium in Sao Paulo .
Additionally, more than 170,000 people have been evicted from their homes in the favelas of Brazil.
These evictions are often violent, and sometimes happen overnight.
And lastly, the Brazilian government has passed “Exceptional laws” to cater to FIFA’s demands.
These laws override existing laws, and allow certain actions to be performed that would otherwise be illegal.
For instance, these laws allow states and cities to incur higher debts for the World Cup than otherwise permitted.
In addition, at FIFA’s demand, the country has set up a 2 km “exclusion” zone around each stadium.
Withing this zone, FIFA has power over who enters these areas and what is sold, essentially superseding the authority of the Brazilian state.
Only goods approved by FIFA can be sold her- thus, a restaurant in this zone could be fined for selling Pepsi instead of Coca Cola  which sponsors the World Cup .
This is a particularly sticky topic for many Brazilians, as such a law was used by Brazil’s military dictatorship in the 1980s to suppress dissent.
Social movements fear that such laws could be used to suppress political protests.
7 ].
Supposedly created to reduce crime and speed up the often lethargic Brazilian courts, protesters fear that  these will be used to suppress dissent.
Until 2012, the head of the CBF was a man called Ricardo Teixeira .
Teixeira was known to be extremely corrupt- he is known to have stolen around 10 million dollars during the ISL scandal, and is known to have had a “relationship” with Nike in which he would receive a cut of their merchandise sold in Brazil.
Teixeira is also known to be a bit of a bully.
He is widely believed to be one of the reasons England lost it’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup  .
In 2012, when the weight of these allegations became too much for even the CBF, he was forced to “resign” and now lives in a multimilliondollar mansion in Miami.
Romario has called the CBF a “disgrace,” and believes that Teixeira is “directly a part of everything that has been evil in Brazilian football for the last 10 years” According to Romario, FIFA has robbed the Brazilian public and that the country will be worse off due to the tournament.
He believes, like many protestors, that the money could better have been spent on improving services in Brazil.
As someone who is interested in running for politics in Brazil, his criticisms have clearly struck a chord in Brazil .
The Protests-more to come in 2014?
So while the straw that broke the camel’s back may have been the implementation of the bus tax, there were many underlying factors behind the 2013 protests in Brazil.
Starting in Goiânia, the protests spread across the country.
The largest protests were in Rio de Janeiro, where almost 400,000 people showed up to protest.
The protesters had several demands, some relating to the expenditure of the sporting events.
They wanted more spending on public transportation, education, hospitals, and science.
Additionally, the protesters also demanded that royalties from Brazil’s newly discovered oilfields be used to improve the social welfare of all Brazilians in a transparent manner .
They also wanted to repeal and prevent passage of laws that would hinder the fight against corruption.
PEC 37 would have limited the ability of federal prosecutors to investigate crimes.
Federal prosecutors in Brazil are widely respected, and are known to be less corrupt than other institutions of the state.
They had instigated many anticorruption efforts, including the stories that broke the meselao scandal.
PEC 37 would have removed such powers, and assigned them exclusively to the police, who are among Brazil’s most corrupt institutions.
Ultimately, these protests were partially successful.
PEC 37 was defeated in the Brazilian Congress, and the Senate voted to spend 75% of oil revenues on education and 25% on health infrastructure.
They also agreed to increase the number of doctors and allow new prosecutors in the fight against corruption.

A vice president of soccer s governing body denied allegations he received favors for backing Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup in a vote already marred by accusations of corruption.
FIFA executive Issa Hayatou is also the head of African soccer.
The British newspaper said that banned former Qatari official Mohammed bin Hammam, once a FIFA vice president, targeted African officials with cash gifts, luxury trips and other favors to influence the voting four years ago.
Among the denials, Hayatou said bin Hammam did not arrange treatment for him at a private clinic in return for support.
The African federation also said Hayatou did not receive  valuable gifts  on a trip to Doha and has  never received any money  from Bin Hammam, the emir of Qatar or any member of the Qatar bid committee.
Hayatou was one of four Africans on FIFA s executive committee when it chose Russia and Qatar as World Cup host countries for 2018 and 2022 in a process tarnished by accusations of vote buying.
Ultimately, only three of those African members voted after Nigeria s Amos Adamu was suspended from the votes and later banned from soccer for three years for seeking bribes during the bidding.
Adamu was exposed in an undercover investigation by The Sunday Times.
The Sunday Times now says bin Hammam used slush funds to make payments to accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African soccer associations as part of an attempt to eventually influence the voting African members on the executive committee.
The African federation said Hayatou  denied categorically  the string of allegations.
Hayatou received expensive gifts from bin Hammam on a trip to Doha in December 2009, a year before the World Cup vote.
He was involved in a payment of $400,000 to the soccer federation in his native Cameroon through FIFA s Goal project, which bin Hammam headed at the time.
He received 60 World Cup tickets from bin Hammam just before the December 2010 World Cup vote.
Bin Hammam arranged for Hayatou, who has suffered from ill health, to be treated at a private clinic after he voted for Qatar to get the World Cup.
Hayatou accepted luxury accommodation and business class tickets from Qatar s 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
The Sunday Times said a  senior FIFA insider  had provided it with  hundreds of millions of emails, accounts and other documents  detailing bin Hammam s attempts to build support for Qatar s bid using money and favors.
Bin Hammam was a member of FIFA s executive committee for 16 years and president of the Asian Football Confederation, but was expelled from FIFA in 2012 for financial corruption.
The 67-year-old Hayatou has been the head of African soccer since 1987.
He has said this will be his last term of office.
As soccer fans flock to their televisions for the World Cup final this weekend, the FBI and international investigators are looking ahead to allegations of corruption and abuse halfway around the world in Qatar, where the 2022 games are scheduled to take place in one of the hottest places on earth -- where daytime temperatures regularly reach 124 degrees.
During the World Cup this year in Brazil officials declared the first-of-its-kind water break during a match when the temperature hit the mid-80s, fearing for the health of the players.
Before Qatar won their bid for the 2022 World Cup, soccer federation officials were warned in advanced about the potentially dangerous heat in Qatar that makes its capital of Doha look like a ghost town during the day – some 40 degrees hotter than during the pause in Brazil.
They were also told about allegations by human rights groups of what the groups called medieval conditions for migrant workers there that could cost the lives of hundreds who will build the new World Cup stadiums.
In one migrant living space visited by ABC News last month, 10 beds were stacked together in a single room.
18 potential host cities.
S.
Not long after the vote, allegations surfaced that some FIFA members had been bribed to vote for Qatar.
Most of the allegations focused on prominent Qatari billionaire businessman Mohammad Bin Hammam, then a FIFA board member accused by The Sunday Times and others of giving cash and lavish gifts.
There’s no doubt about it that he’s going around using a secret slush fund paying football officials all over the place,” Sunday Times reporter Jonathan Calvert told ABC News.
The Sunday Times based a recent expose on a cache of “millions” of leaked documents surrounding the bidding.
A FIFA vice president from the Caribbean was forced to resign after allegations surfaced that he took more than $1 million from the Qatari businessman.
He says he was the victim of a witch hunt.
Alexandra Wrage worked on an independent panel designed to investigate and combat allegations of corruption in FIFA itself before she quit last year out of sheer frustration.
It was pretty clear… that independent oversight was not welcomed and that more transparency, frankly, was not welcome,” Wrage told ABC News.
FIFA has launched an internal investigation into the Qatar allegations, but officials in the Gulf state maintain they won the vote fair and square.
They say that the allegations of corruption are the result of racism.
They also said they’ll be able to defeat the unbearable heat with new technology, including innovative stadium designs and cutting-edge cooling systems, according to a 2011 Associated Press report.
The results of FIFA’s own investigation are expected soon, amid calls for a new vote on who should host the 2022 games.

FIFA just may end up voting again on the host location of the 2022 World Cup.
A report published in England’s Sunday Times alleges FIFA officials accepted payments of around $5m in exchange for supporting Qatar’s bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
The allegations are based on millions of secret documents that are said to outline how former Qatari football official Mohamed Bin Hammam bought other officials’ votes.
FIFA’s chief investigator, Michael Garcia, has already been investigating the possibility of impropriety with regards to the 2022 elections.
He is set to meet with officials from the Qatar 2022 organizing committee on Monday.
Suspicions of wrongdoing have already plagued this World Cup.
That’s not to mention Qatar’s labor laws, its stance on homosexuality, and the fact that the Cup will almost certainly need to be moved to winter due to the desert state’s extreme summer temperatures.
But is this document trail the final push FIFA need to call for a revote on who will host the 2022 World Cup?
As a member currently of the Fifa executive committee, we feel that any evidence whatsoever that people involved were bribed to do a certain vote, all that evidence should go to Michael Garcia, whom Fifa have given full authority to.
If Garcia’s report comes up and his recommendations are that wrongdoing happened for that vote for the 2022 World Cup, I certainly as a member of the executive committee would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a revote.
The path to a revote won’t be a simple one – this story is certain to include many more twists and turns.
But maybe, just maybe, it will be the final push that removes Qatar as a World Cup host nation.
Revote creates a simple means for the end – removing WC from Qatar.
Wouldn’t the US get the WC since it was 2nd in voting?
Assuming US still wants it of course.
While I believe the cup should be moved from Qatar, this comment is racist and reactionary.
Citing “their peoples penchants for violent behavior” is like me citing westerners penchant for imperialism and the slaughter of innocent people in the name of oil interests.
It’s an affront to Arabs and Arab-Americans  which I am not , and it’s not worthy of this board.
Regarding “their peoples penchant for violent behavior,” you should be made aware that Qatar is an ally of the USA, has hosted US troops since the first gulf war and in fact hosts USCENTCOM’s forward deployed headquarters.
Insulting friends is a good way to lose friends.
With friends like Qatar, who needs enemies, raysfan?
Fact of the matter is that FIFA – based on the above information – needs to move the World Cup from Qatar, period.
First, please note I did not address whether I think the World Cup should be moved.
That is a separate issue.
For the record, if the allegations are proven true, the I agree they should lost the 2022World Cup.
Now as to the “with friends like Qatar” bit… If the government was not friendly towards the US and not able to provide the necessary security, we would not be able to have a mission as important as the USCENTCOM forward headquarters based there.
Qatar has actually been very consistently pro-US and NATO.
9 per 100,000 people in 2012, according to a study conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
8 per 100,000 people in the same year.
So… it’s a bit absurd to toss stones at Qatar for the violent behavior of their people.
I think that was more in reference to barbaric practices like stoning still being practiced there.
My personal beef with Qatar is over their government’s human rights record.
Thousands have died already and many more are projected to before 2022.
But hey, they’re pro-USA, so it’s all good.
Probably also reference to slave labor and the mass deaths of their immigrant workers.
It would be a good start if you started actually learning more and lecturing less.
But then again you’re probably just another uneducated San Fran liberal.
Agreed 100%.
It was painfully obvious to most everyone that the decision on Qatar was rigged from the jump.
Part of the process needs to be that the host country be “civilized”.
This years World Cup will be a disaster.
Qatar will be just as bad if it is allowed to go through but for different reasons.
A proper climate and proper population is a must.
Bribery for votes is standard practice with virtually all of these big name competitions.
If it is not money changing hands it is a quid pro quo that they vote for each other’s bids to host in different years.
Whenever there is this much money and prestige in the mix there will always be some level of bribery going on.
Nothing like a little post about the Arabs to bring out the bigots, eh?
Ah, this country was formed out of Christian values not Islamic ones.
Tolerance is and should be a distant 2nd.
Gee, what an out-of-the-blue accusation.
Next you’ll be telling us that the WWE or NBA are rigged.
Everyone knows how you get the World Cup.
The question isn’t whether FIFA  like the IOC  is bribed, but how openly it’s done and whether it can be covered up.
In this case, it may have been so brazen that even FIFA can’t ignore it or rationalize it.
I think they’ll make a heck of an effort to ignore the evidence, but in the long run may have to give the cup to someone else–but probably not those evil Americans.
These threads always make me laugh.
We view Qatar as violent, and yet how many wars have they started in the last 60 years?
S.
A.
And when our current President called for non-violent means to solve international conflicts he got ridiculed in the media and by politicians for being weak.
As for mistreatment of migrant workers, really?
Go look at the incidence of cancer and liver failure in migrant workers picking crops in California, Texas, and Florida.
Pesticides can be hazardous to your health.
After that, take a look at the number of mutilations in our factory meat processing plants in the Midwest.
Stealing from your migrant workers?
Try Walmart and McDonalds who pay their workers so low that they often have to be on food stamps.
They do it legally, the frequency that small employers steal from migrant works has been shown to be even higher.
Of course the Qataries only had to pay five million in bribes, and it was illegal, the Supreme Court made it legal to buy our politicians, a much smarter path if you ask me, but it costs a lot more.
By that measure the Qataries are better businessmen.
S.
China in factories that essentially use slave labor.
Speaking of China, did I mention that our rate of capital punishment is one of the highest in the world, right up there with, you guessed it, China.
Not that we’re violent or anything.
Yeah, but if you take out Texas, our rate of capital punishment goes down about 40 places.
So that’s gotta count for something.
Did I mention I live in Texas?
I’m so proud… And of course we favor minorities in our treatment.
Same nonsense that Europe always brings up in regards to US.
Sure, the US has murders and gun violence whereas Europe has a much lower murder rate, however, they also fail to mention that they start a war every 20 to 40 years that kills millions of people across the continent.
I don’t recall mentioning Europe in this.
I did an indirect comparison between our view of Qatar and our own behavior.
What’s more, I don’t much care what Europe does, I care what my country does, and it isn’t pretty.
It hardly seems fair to whine about Qatar’s behavior when our own is quite possibly worse.

FIFA claims that its new approach will ultimately lead to zero tolerance for bribery and corruption within the international soccer body.
Now, Blatter has announced the formation of several task forces, with a mandate to propose reforms that are focused on transparency and compliance.
At the same time, though, news of corruption within FIFA and the world of international sports continues to break, leading observers to question whether Blatter’s reforms can work.
In this column, I will discuss the proposed FIFA governance reforms and argue that while the framework is a good step, the substance of the reforms currently remains vague, and needs to be further particularized.
I’ll also suggest that other international sports organizations should also heed the call for greater transparency and accountability, to bring integrity and public confidence back to international sports.
In May 2011, at a meeting in Trinidad and Tobago, a candidate for FIFA’s presidency , Mohamed bin Hammam, allegedly offered $40,000 bribes to Caribbean soccer officials and the president of the Caribbean  Soccer Union, in exchange for their votes.
The allegations sparked a FIFA investigation in which the punishments, handed down on October 14, ranged from reprimands to an 18-month suspension.
Bin Hammam was permanently suspended from FIFA and FIFA’s then-Vice President, Trinidad and Tobago’s Jack Warner, resigned under a cloud.
Then, late this October, FIFA announced that it wanted to speak with 10 more Caribbean officials in its investigation.
That brings the number of Caribbean officials currently under investigation by FIFA to 26.
His resignation, significant in itself, also highlights concerns about the  ability of Brazil to host both the World Cup, in 2014, and the Olympics, in 2016.
The IAAF will announce in Monaco on Friday, November 11, whether London will be awarded the 2017 World Championships; its rival is Doha, Qatar’s capital.
Meanwhile, in the UK, a trio of Pakistani cricketers were recently prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced for corruption and match-rigging.
Sadly, corruption in international athletics goes back quite a while.
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo infamously received more than $200,000 in cash payments and medical treatment, while his wife, Eugenie, reportedly maxed out a bid-committee credit card while shopping at Wal-Mart.
More recently, in Fall 2010, the voting to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was compromised by allegations of corruption.
The whistleblower has since retracted her allegations.
Some news accounts report that FIFA’s bid requirements fit on two A4 pieces of paper—in contrast with more detailed Olympic bidding requirements.
6 million to host a soccer congress of African nations in Angola—thus preventing the United States, Australia, South Korea, and Japan from making their own bids for the 2022 World Cup at the conference.
Reform is urgently needed, as FIFA faces many seemingly well-founded criticisms.
They also charge that FIFA’s conflict-of-interest rules are unrealistic, and are not sufficiently comprehensive, allowing certain suspect payments or transactions to occur.
FIFA’s new reform framework—and a framework is truly all it is, at this stage—proposes to set up a Good Governance Committee.
The Committee is to be formed by this December, and the entire road map for reform is meant to be completed by June 2012.
One task force would focus on ethics, working to update the FIFA Ethics Code and to develop procedures seeking to stamp out corruption.
To clarify the prohibition, FIFA may need to promulgate a guidance or a set of interpretive notes that focuses on typical gifts.
Blatter said that FIFA will also, this December, reopen a case related to ISL, a defunct marketing firm that had done work for FIFA  and allegedly paid kickbacks to FIFA officials and will reveal court documents from the investigation.
1 million in alleged kickbacks from ISL-linked World Cup television deals.
FIFA has often defended its officials by insisting that commercial bribery was not a crime in Switzerland at the time, and that no officials were charged in a criminal investigation into ISL’s bankruptcy.
Are the Proposed FIFA Reforms Enough?
Transparency International  TI , the international anti-corruption NGO, has welcomed FIFA’s initial steps, and was asked to advise FIFA as it began its efforts at reform.
They have addressed several key issues but there is still a lot of work to do to restore credibility and we will have to wait until December to see how far and how quickly they act,” said Sylvia Schenk, TI’s sports adviser.
As noted above, the committee will be called the Good Governance Committee.
FIFA also needs to spell out ethical rules of the road for its members.
4  reporting and approval rules for invitations received by FIFA officials, staff and volunteers; and  5  special guidelines for high-risk areas.
Moreover,  6  The composition, scope, and approach of the multi-stakeholder group need to ensure its independence from FIFA.
Moreover, it is unclear how an international sports corruption authority would interact with national anti-corruption commissions and prosecutors.
Thus, at this stage of the fight against corruption in international sports, the best approach may be to have major  sports associations and nonprofits update their ethical codes, close loopholes, and focus on how to bring greater transparency—and thus, integrity—into their own processes.
International leaders—in the G20 and elsewhere—might also want to take up the issue of international sports corruption.
They, too, ought to emphasize the need for better transparency mechanisms, and should ensure that governments and sporting groups work hard to rebuild public trust in the integrity of soccer and other sports.
As FIFA embarks on its roadmap, let’s hope its journey is not an empty one, and that the organization can finally come closer to living up to its stated goals.

The half-hour programme saw investigative journalist Andrew Jennings look into allegations of corruption with FIFA, the world s governing body of association football.
Within the programme he alleged that three members of FIFA s executive committee had been given bribes by International Sports and Leisure, a marketing partner of FIFA.
The three men - Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira - were reportedly involved with a sports marketing firm responsible for broadcasting rights and took money from them.
Jennings further alleged that a fourth current official has been involved in ticket touting.
Both of these matters had not been properly investigated by Sepp Blatter, the President of FIFA.
It also made a series of claims about the bidding process for hosting the FIFA World Cup.
The documentary was broadcast only three days before the result of the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups were announced.
This led to fears from some people that it could ruin England s chances of hosting the former tournament, with some accusing the BBC of being unpatriotic; however, the BBC defended these claims.
Russia ultimately won the right to host the FIFA World Cup in 2018, with Qatar emerging victorious for the 2022 tournament.
The question of whether the documentary was a crucial factor in England losing the contest was brought up by a number of key figures after the result was announced.
Hayatou, who is the vice-president of FIFA, denied all accusations of involvement in the scheme and claimed money was in fact paid to the Confederation of African Football  CAF .
He threatened to sue the BBC for the making of the documentary.
The programme received 52 complaints from viewers.
How did this documentary cause England to lose the 2018 World Cup?
England were considered as forerunners to win the bid for a while.
There should be another investigation into why.
I was originally under the impression that two English FIFA reps were caught with their hands in the cookie jar?
Anyone?
Denmark.
All due respect to Qatar, but who in the hell are they and what is their contribution to world football and also, speaking as a cynic and sceptic by nature how much are they paying Sep and his cohorts?
One startling revelation in this documentary is that FIFA want tax breaks that guarantee  reportedly  £3 Billion in tourney earnings and that this should be kept secret from the taxpayers!
Well done the Nederland s for exposing this truth.
Our pathetic pot of piss-head politicians don’t have the balls to stand up to these bullies and crooks.
World Cup.
Keep it FIFA and expect a call from our lawyers presently.
Sepp Blatter  besides being a moron in my opinion  and his cronies are on the up and up at approx the same level as is Juan Antonio Samaranch and his committee.
Everyone knows they are all paid off to vote in certain countries to host Olympics and the World Cup.
Ok I am way to tired to try to make a sensible posting so i should go away and try this again tomorrow lol.
I will add this last bit before i do go.
On the subject of bribes, I have recently read a very good book about bribery in soccer football called The Fix written by a guy named Declan Hill.
It was a fascinating read about bribery in professional soccer football going back many years.
While some parts were shocking in there claims of high level games being fixed it has made me watch some games, that normally I would have just sat back and enjoyed.
It s been a fact for over 20 years that fifa is a dirty organisation.
Even the ex Uefa president hinted that.
Qatar is not a great football force, it has successfully hosted a number of internationals.
Hahaha to avoid any secrecies they just organise it in a country which has one of the lowest taxrates in the world and no income tax.
And Problem solved!
Corruption is in the air!
It s a shame it goes way beyond the game of football!
I truly admire your altruistic and benevolent attitude by setting up this site great site; how however It s doesn t justify censoring others on certain subjects.
Thank You for reconsidering your take on this issue.
I am still amazed Qatar won the World Cup legitimately!
So someone will be upset, Western fans or the Muslims that reside there!
Although you would need an alcohol permit.

How Beer Saved the World Did you know that beer was critical to the birth of civilization?
With only a solitary name on the ballot paper, it was the kind of election that would do a banana republic proud.
And to the surprise of no one, Sepp Blatter triumphantly regained the crown of world football last night in a humiliating snub to England and Prince William.
Their attempt to derail Blatter’s re-election was overwhelmingly slapped down despite the corruption claims swirling around him.
Delegates at Fifa’s congress in Zurich were presented with a blue ballot paper bearing only Blatter’s name for president.
Yet they still took two hours to elect him winner of the one-horse race.
England’s misery was complete when Blatter’s victory was officially declared by Argentina’s delegate to the congress of world football’s governing body.
Earlier, he had branded England ‘pirates’ and revealed how he had told the team bidding to get England to host the 2018 World Cup that he would only support their bid if the Falkland Islands were handed to Argentina.
Julio Grondona told delegates: ‘We always have attacks from England which are mostly lies with the support of journalism which is more busy lying than telling the truth.
Of the 206 football associations who took part in the ballot, 186 voted for Blatter, with three papers spoiled and 17 associations abstaining.
Clutching a bouquet, the rotund 75-year-old Swiss took to the stage to accept the result and told the congress: ‘I thank you for your trust and confidence.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Blatter likened himself to a ship’s captain ‘weathering the storm’ and admitted: ‘We have made mistakes and we will learn from this.
The ballot went ahead after England lost a principled attempt to have the election postponed.
Football Association chairman David Bernstein – with backing from FA president Prince William and David Cameron – had called on the congress to abort the vote until a corruption-free candidate could be found.
But the world’s football associations overwhelmingly rejected the FA’s proposal by 178 votes to 17, with even Wales and Northern Ireland snubbing it, though the Scottish FA gave its support.
The humiliation continued with the leaders of associations from Haiti, the Congo, Benin, Fiji and Cyprus all speaking out against England’s ‘lies’.
In a speech before his coronation, Blatter piled insult on injury to England’s failed bid last year to host the World Cup by belatedly vowing, if elected, to fix the corrupt voting system over which he has presided.
But his promise to reform comes too late for England, which lost out to Russia on hosting the 2018 tournament.
England’s bid team – headed by Prince William, the Prime Minister and football star David Beckham – was humiliated last December by winning only two votes amid suspicions that other nations may have been willing to engage in bribery.
The prince remains ‘bitterly disappointed’ by the rejection and last night Mr Cameron backed him by joining calls for reform.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘The most important thing in all of this is that the public have confidence in Fifa and, in order for that to happen, we need Fifa to reform.
Blatter declared that in future, World Cup host countries would be chosen differently.
The overhaul would mean that instead of a vote of 24 executive members – nine of whom are presently mired in corruption claims – there would be a ballot of the 208 football associations.
At the World Cup vote: Prince William with David Beckham and David Cameron.
Earlier this week it was alleged that 25 Caribbean officials were each offered a $40,000  £24,000  bribe three weeks ago to vote for Mohamed Bin Hammam from Qatar in Fifa’s presidential election.
Bin Hammam, Blatter’s only challenger, withdrew his candidacy hours before he was suspended by Fifa’s ethics committee over the bribery allegations along with another executive committee member, Jack Warner of Trinidad, and two other Caribbean officials.
At the same time, an email was revealed in which Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke hinted that Qatar had ‘bought’ the right to stage the 2022 World Cup.
The bungs scandal has damaged trust in the World Cup, but Blatter only responded when big-money sponsors Coca Cola, Adidas and Visa voiced ‘distress’ at the claims.

European soccer leaders told Sepp Blatter not to run for a fifth term as president of FIFA, saying he’s damaged the governing body’s reputation during his 16 years in charge.
It was masterful.
Oliver, whose segment on the proposed end of net neutrality earlier this month went viral, touched on nearly every contemporary criticism of the organization, ripping them for everything from 2014 World Cup costs to Qatar’s abysmal human-rights record.
Blatter, 78, has been meeting with representatives from FIFA’s 209 member associations to gather support for next year’s vote, after reversing a decision to stand aside.

Blatter took office in 1998 and the ruling body has had to deal with other crises, including the expulsion of Mohamed Bin Hammam, a former ally who stood against Swiss resident Blatter in 2011.
The Qatari quit the race days before an investigation into claims he tried to bribe voters in the Caribbean with envelopes stuffed with $40,000, leaving Blatter unopposed.
In the last eight or nine years, FIFA has built an ugly reputation, not only in the press but you only have to look at Twitter — #FIFA #Blatter #FIFA Mafia,” Dutch Football Association Chairman Michael van Praag told Blatter after the FIFA president told delegates from the 54 members of European governing body UEFA that the global organization was in the middle of a storm.
There are reasons — bribery, money and corruption are so often linked,” Van Praag said.
FIFA has a bad reputation.
Van Praag’s remarks came a day after members of African soccer’s confederation gave Blatter a standing ovation when he told them of his re-election plans.
In that meeting, he described as racist reports in the British media alleging wrongdoing in Qatar’s bid.
It doesn’t matter which media does it, it was raised in the media and it must be addressed by the governing body of world football,” Dyke said.
UEFA President Michel Platini will decide in September whether to oppose Blatter.
The Frenchman has regional support, including from Dyke.
David Gill, chief executive officer of English Premier League team Manchester United and a member of UEFA’s executive board, said structural changes that FIFA made in the past two years to improve corporate governance don’t do enough.
It’s “the people within that structure that determine whether that structure works, whether it’s effective, whether it’s efficient and delivers for all of us a FIFA that’s fit for purpose,” Gill told reporters.
Qatar denies it acted improperly during its bid.
Gill said Blatter should focus on risks to the $5 billion event rather than criticize media.
This is their biggest product,” he said.
This is the one that generates all the income for FIFA every four years.
Officials from Germany and Norway, along with former UEFA President Lennart Johansson, who Blatter beat to win his first term as head of FIFA, also spoke out after the meeting at the Renaissance Hotel in Sao Paulo.
People link FIFA to corruption and bribery and all kinds of old boys’ networks,” Van Praag told reporters after addressing Blatter.
About a third of the FIFA executive board members who voted for Qatar’s 2022 bid have left the governing body amid allegations of corruption.
There is not a storm in football,” Infantino said.
There is a storm in FIFA and this storm is not new.
For 15 minutes after the game, the doors to the dressing room remained closed.
Much of the area surrounding Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has been left in ruins amid political corruption and disorganization.
This year’s World Cup final will be played at Brazil’s iconic Maracana stadium, a venue that is in many ways a beacon of power, strength, and an illustrious history.
But it’s also a reminder of darkness, disappointment and failure.
Lying in the imposing shadow of the Maracana is the slum area of Favela do Metro.
Redevelopment has ensured that hundreds of houses have been reduced to rubble since initial work began almost three years ago.
There have been countless forced evictions.
But now, the remaining families are refusing to leave their homes.
Authorities say the shacks will be demolished by the end of this month regardless.
And for what?
Well, in 2011, Rio de Janeiro’s housing secretary told of how the shantytown and the area around the Maracana would be transformed in time for the 2014 World Cup.
Cultural centers, cinemas and plazas would be built.
But that turned out to be the usual rhetoric.
Now the word is that a shopping center will be constructed where families once lived and children once played.
Some 40 houses are still standing.
For those defiant enough to refuse to leave, they now share the neighborhood with crack addicts who squat in the ruins left by the bulldozers.
Needless to say, there have been numerous protests.
It’s been an annoyance for organizers and administrators.
This social unrest isn’t going away quietly.
And why should it?
Last summer, while Brazil and Spain were about to walk onto the Maracana’s hallowed sod for the start of the Confederations Cup final, protestors outside were throwing rocks and firecrackers at police.
And then the tear gas started.
Then the armored vehicles arrived.
With the whole world watching, a movement had swelled.
The dissent first began in Sao Paulo after a 10 percent increase in bus fares.
It quickly swarmed across the country, engulfing Brasilia, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre.
It became about education and healthcare, too.
It became about the World Cup and how almost $3 billion of public money had been spent on stadiums.
6 billion of public money had been spent on “legacy” projects.
FIFA acknowledges that there will be more protests this summer.
So, does this mean “joga bonito,” the infectious tagline of Brazilian football, which translates to “play beautifully,” is dead and gone?
Has Brazil, the spiritual home of football, fallen out of love with it?
According to Alex Bellos, author of the definitive “Futebol: The Brazilian Way Of Life,” Brazilians are seeking an openness from the country’s administrators.
They desire to push past the age-old issues of widespread corruption and mismanagement -- issues still very much at the center of Brazilian football.
I don’t think Brazil is falling out of love with football,” Bellos wrote in an email.
What is happening is that the organization of football represents all that is bad about Brazilian society.
The football leaders have certainly let the country down.
Ricardo Teixeira, head of the Brazilian football federation  CBF  for 23 years and a member of the FIFA Executive Committee for 18 years, resigned in March 2012.
He cited “ill health” as the reason.
He was subsequently found to have accepted millions of dollars in World Cup kickbacks.
Before sheepishly making his exit, he had been in charge of the 2014 World Cup Organizing Committee.
Maybe it was a family thing.
His former father-in-law, Joao Havelange, resigned from his honorary FIFA role in April of last year.
Up until 1998, he had been the organization’s president for 24 years, preceding Sepp Blatter.
But he had also taken bribes.
A member of the International Olympic Committee for 48 years, Havelange resigned from that position in December 2011, days before the IOC was due to sanction him for alleged wrong-doing.
Coincidentally, Rio’s Joao Havelange Stadium -- scheduled to host the 2016 Summer Olympics -- is currently closed for repair work.
There was a flaw in its original design.
Brazilians are disillusioned.
But for many, the problems were inevitable.
Speaking to the BBC last year, sports journalist Juca Kfouri didn’t put all of the blame on the government.
There is another Brazilian way of doing things,” he said.
They force the government to provide more public funds as an emergency contingency without the proper oversight.
Politicians benefit, construction companies have a ball of it, as do the large advertising agencies -- and that’s that.
Romario, the legendary Brazilian striker, is now a politician in Rio and a firm critic of the vast public monies spent on the World Cup.
He’s criticized former international teammates Ronaldo and Bebeto, who are part of the organizing committee.

The 2022 Qatar World Cup Is Already A Disaster - What The Hell Was FIFA Thinking?
You just need to forget sanity and understand how FIFA works.
UPDATE - September 23, 2014: A member of FIFA s executive board has come out and suggested that it s likely the 2022 World Cup, if it s indeed held in Qatar, will lead to fan deaths from the oppressive desert heat .
Is FIFA seriously back-peddling on the decision to give the tournament to Qatar?
And if so, what happened?
Sane outsiders are baffled.
FIFA’s choice of hosts for World Cups 2018 and 2022 just doesn’t seem to make sense.
Russia, named as host for 2018, barely has any decent stadiums.
The country is hard to travel around, corrupt and not very democratic.
Qatar, host for 2022, is so hot in summer that even FIFA’s own evaluation report admitted that the temperatures could endanger the health of players and other visitors.
Moreover, the tiny Gulf state has a hopeless soccer team and doesn’t even pretend to be a democracy.
S.
World Cup tomorrow morning — lost pretty hopelessly.
Yet there is a logic to everything, even to the choice of Qatar.
You just need to forget sanity and understand how FIFA works.
Let me say straight out that I’m not going to touch the issue of bribes.
We know that two of the original 24 members of FIFA’s executive committee  ExCo , Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu, looked willing to trade their votes for money when asked by undercover British reporters posing as bidders.
FIFA suspended Temarii and Adamu.
Let’s just assume that the remaining 22 ExCo members — mostly elderly men — are pure as the day they were born.
I have no evidence that bribes swayed any voters.
In any case, it’s quite possible that a losing country tried to bribe and the two winners did not.
Rather, let’s use what we do know about FIFA to explain the two choices.
First of all, the democratic deficits of Qatar and Russia won’t have bothered most ExCo members for a second.
Many of these men built glittering careers in countries that weren’t  and sometimes still aren’t  very democratic.
Other members, including FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have shown themselves quite capable of dealing with dictators without throwing up.
In understanding how the ExCo thinks, we can toss the democratic issue out of the window.
Nor will the ExCo have worried about the unpreparedness of Qatar and Russia to host a World Cup.
The last World Cup mostly put that issue to bed.
South Africa hosted a smooth tournament.
After that, the ExCo members will have reasoned that Russia and Qatar could, too.
In fact, FIFA actively prefers countries without experience in hosting big tournaments.
These are new markets.
Blatter, who is 74 and vain, is very keen on leaving behind a legacy.
Something went wrong.

Millions of soccer fans around the world have been waiting four years for the 2014 World Cup, which begins on Thursday.
Millions of American sports fans, however — who have been spending that time watching  American  football, basketball, and baseball — will tune in and be a little confused.
Soccer s definitely  becoming more popular in the US , but it s still not quite mainstream.
Though there are lots of hardcore American soccer fans, there are many more that will watch the World Cup this summer but don t know a ton about the sport and might be unaware of some of the Beautiful Game s finer points.
If you fall into this latter group, this piece is for you.
Here s what you need to know to fake it as a legit soccer fan for the 2014 World Cup.
1.
The world s top soccer players spend most of their time playing for privately-owned teams that represent cities in country-specific leagues — like Manchester United or Real Madrid — in a system that roughly parallels American pro sports.
But elite players also spend some of their time playing for their home countries  national teams as part of the World Cup, organized by FIFA  the Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
Unlike American sports, these matches are considered the pinnacle of the sport — not in terms of quality of play, but in terms of the importance assigned to it.
FIFA claims half of humanity tuned into one match or another during the last World Cup.
It s as if Olympic hockey mattered more than the Stanley Cup, or the World Baseball Classic was more important than the  poorly named  World Series.
We re about to start the World Cup finals, which take place every four years.
32 national teams compete in a tournament held in one country over the course of about a month, with billions of people watching worldwide.
The last one, in 2010, was held in South Africa, and Spain won.
But in between each of these tournaments, there are hundreds of qualifying matches that winnow the field down from 209 national teams to the 32 that make the final tournament.
The 32 blue countries have teams in the World Cup finals.
Yellow countries do not.
Last December, the 32 teams that made it into this years  finals were arranged into eight groups of four that are supposedly of even quality, based on a combination of rankings, geography, and random chance.
2.
The month-long tournament is divided into two stages.
First, as part of the group stage, each team played the three other countries in its group.
For example,  the US was in Group G, with Ghana, Portugal, and Germany.
They played each of these teams once  on June 16, 22, and 26, respectively , and the three other teams played each other once as well.
In this stage, a win counts for three points, a draw counts for one point, and a loss is zero points.
When all these matches finished on June 26, the two teams with the most points from each group advanced.
In Group G, that was Germany and the US.
On June 28, the winning 16 teams entered a single-elimination tournament, called the knockout stage.
It works pretty much like the NCAA tournament — 16 teams get cut down to 8, then 4, then 2 teams as each round progresses.
In this phase, there are no draws: tie matches are followed by 30 minutes of extra time  divided into two 15-minute halves .
This extra time isn t sudden death — it continues for the full 30 minutes, even if either team scores.
Afterward, if both teams are still tied, they enter a penalty kick shootout, in which each time takes five shots and the team with the most goals wins.
3.
The US men s national team poses before an October 23 match against Panama.
Every World Cup, there are unusually strong groups stocked with solid teams, nicknamed the  groups of death.  Coming into the tournament this year, many felt Group G — which featured the US,  Germany ,  Portugal , and Ghana — was it.
But the US team s dramatic victory in game 1 against Ghana, paired with a draw against Portugal , gave them just enough points to make it out of Group G, and make it into the knockout stage for the second straight World Cup.
Unlike in many other team sports, the US team has never been a world soccer power, and only has a single knockout round win since 1930.
They weren t able to change that this year, with a heartbreaking 2-1 loss to a tough Belgium team in the first round of knockout play this year.
4.
Germany defeated Brazil 7-1.
Four of the world s best teams made it to the quarterfinals.
But  Brazil , the favorite team coming in to the tournament, suffered a shocking 7-1 loss to Germany, allowing the most goals ever in a World Cup semi-final.
In the championship, Germany played Argentina — a team that features forward Lionel Messi, one of the world s top goal scorers — and defeated the Netherlands in penalty kicks during the semi-finals.
Germany won, 1-0.
5.
The 4-2-3-1 formation, increasingly popular in recent years.
To a casual viewer, soccer might seem pretty straightforward: you have two teams of eleven players on a field  called a pitch , both trying to put a spherical ball into the other team s goal.
They can use any part of their body besides their arms or hands to do so, except the goalie  called a keeper , who can use his hands as long as he s within a box in front of his own net.
The nuances of the game, though, are more complicated than you might expect.
An offensive player is offside if he is in the attacking half of the field, doesn t have the ball, and goes behind the second-farthest back defender  including the keeper .
If this player gets involved in the play — say, by being passed the ball — it s a violation, and the other teams gets a free kick.
This complex rule is intended to prevent offensive players from just sitting by the net, waiting for the ball.
A yellow card is shown to a player after he commits a misconduct, a  type of foul .
If he commits a second misconduct, a red card is shown, and he s ejected — forcing his team to play one man down for the rest of the match.
A throw-in occurs when the ball is kicked out of bounds along one of the side lines.
When it goes out the end line, a goal kick occurs if it was last touched by an offensive player, and a corner kick occurs if it was last touched by a defensive player or the keeper.
The match lasts 90 minutes  with two 45-minute halves , and the clock never stops.
Not for goals, injuries, or any time-outs.
Instead, referees  add stoppage time to the end of the match to cover the time used up on substitutions and goal celebrations.
Each team is allowed three substitutions over the course of a match.
For the World Cup, rosters are limited to 23 players: 11 starters and 12 subs.
A team is made up of ten defenders, midfielders, and forwards — with varying numbers of each for strategic reasons — plus one keeper.
Different coaches use all sorts of different numbers and formations of the first three: currently, the 4-2-3-1 formation  four defenders, two defensive midfielders, three attacking midfielders, and a forward  is especially popular.
Like any sport,  the strategy of soccer goes very deep .

Beira Rio stadium, in Porto Alegre, one of seven new or heavily refurbished stadiums built for the World Cup.
To an American, this whole tournament seems pretty Olympic-esque.
So it might come as a surprise that there are actually payouts given to winning teams: FIFA gives out  a total of $576 million , with $35 million going to the champions, $25 million to the runners up, and various amounts to every other team down to $8 million for those eliminated in the group stage.
Like the Olympics, though, the organizing group rakes in most of the money.
Though FIFA is spending an estimated $2 billion on the event, they re projected to take in a record  $4 billion from ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and other revenue streams.
These profits are related to the culture of corruption within FIFA, which has been getting attention from everyone from the New York Times to John Oliver in recent days.
Part of the problem is the secret vote used to award World Cup sites, which allegedly led to Qatari officials paying multimillion-dollar bribes to FIFA in exchange for the 2022 World Cup.
That scandal doesn t directly involve this year s World Cup, but it s added to the aura of corruption surrounding FIFA and casts a shadow over the event.
7.
Students protest in Brasilia.
Brazil absolutely loves soccer.
But the Brazilian government has spent  an estimated $14 billion preparing for the tournament, building seven gleaming new or fully refurbished stadiums around the country, and upgrading airports, roads, and light rail systems.
It is  paying $900 million for security forces alone.
At the same time,  nearly 16 percent of the country lives below the poverty line, basic infrastructure like sewer lines and sidewalks aren t available to many people, and economic growth has slowed in recent years.
That s why many Brazilians are questioning these investments — especially given FIFA s projected profits from the event.
In a recent poll,  61 percent of Brazilians said hosting the event was bad for the country s economy.
Additionally, nine construction workers died during the course of building the stadiums, and about 250,000 people  have been displaced from urban favelas during the lead-up to the event.
Making matters worse is the fact that Rio de Janeiro is also hosting the 2016 Olympics, which will involve further construction of lavish facilities for elites and foreign athletes.
Consequently,  protests, strikes, and riots have erupted in many corners of Brazil as the event draws near.
Most recently, a  subway strike in São Paulo has disrupted transportation in the mega city and threatened instability with matches just a few days away.
8.
You might imagine the World Cup to be a geographically compact event, like the Olympics.
But the 12 stadiums are spread widely across Brazil, a country nearly as large as the US.
As a result, the tournament will entail long-distance travel for the teams.
From the US team s first match, in Natal, they ll fly about 1,700 miles to Manaus, for their second match.
The 12 sites of the 2014 World Cup.
This is the second World Cup to be hosted in Brazil, and the stadiums are spread more evenly than in 1950, with more northern and inland sites involved.
In between matches, teams will stay at self-selected base camps.
The vast majority are staying at either Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, with the US at the latter.
9.
The Spain team celebrates a 2013 win, perhaps a result of abstinence during tournament play.
Among the stranger things to know about the event: some coaches  restrict their players  sex lives during the month of play due to the belief that excessive sex will impede their performance on the field.
Players on Spain, Germany, Chile s teams aren t allowed to have sex at all, while Brazil s players are permitted to have  normal sex  as long as it s not   acrobatic ,  and France s are also allowed to have sex as long as it  doesn t last all night .
Update: all of the teams that explicitly banned all sex  have been eliminated .
So have the majority of the teams that entered the tournament, though, so this doesn t necessarily mean a whole lot.
10.
In the US, the 64 matches will be split between ESPN  43 matches , ESPN2  10 matches  and its parent network ABC  10 matches .
ESPN will also make every game available through its WatchESPN website and apps , but you need to be a subscriber to one of 14 cable companies access them.
You can find the full listings here .
However, if you don t pay for cable but still want to watch, the matches will also be broadcast in Spanish on Univision and streamed online .

Qatari and former FIFA official Mohamed bin Hammam is accused of bribing a committee for rights to host the 2022 World Cup.
Former FIFA Executive Mohamed bin Hammam has been charged with bribing members of a World Cup committee that selected Qatar as host for 2022 s tournament.
A London newspaper alleges that bin Hammam paid out more than $5 million to gain support for Qatar s bid.
A former FIFA executive has been accused of bribing soccer officials in exchange for support in Qatar’s controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
Mohamed bin Hammam, a Qatari citizen and former FIFA executive committee member, is alleged to have paid $5 million in cash, gifts, and legal fees to key members of the 24-person committee that selected Qatar as host for 2022’s World Cup back in 2010, according to CNN .
FIFA investigator and former New York attorney Michael Garcia met with Qatari officials in Oman on Monday to discuss concerns surrounding Qatar s hosting bid legitimacy.
His investigation is reportedly independent of the allegations against bin Hammam brought forth on Sunday by London newspaper The Sunday Times .
Qatar’s World Cup bid committee has denied bribery allegations and connections to bin Hammam during the bidding process.
Daily Mail .
Several FIFA executives are gathering in São Paulo, Brazil this week for an annual congress ahead of 2014’s World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.
FIFA officials could face a revote if evidence mounts against bin Hammam.
If Garcia comes up with concrete evidence and concrete evidence is given to the executive committee and to FIFA, then it has to be looked at very seriously,” he said.
Garcia’s investigation is set to conclude on June 9, only three days before the whistle blows for the 2014 World Cup s opening match.
His report will be finalized within six weeks, according to The Associated Press .
Bin Hammam is accused of establishing as many as 10 slush funds to dole out money to FIFA officials in exchange for their support of a Qatari World Cup bid.
He also allegedly distributed more than $400,000 in cash at parties for African soccer officials to garner support, according to Sky News .

2022 international soccer tournament when the vote took place in 2010.
Bin Hammam was a member of the FIFA committee that awarded hosting rights to Qatar.
He withdrew from the election days before the vote to fight bribery allegations related to the campaign, according to The Associated Press .
Then-FIFA vice president and current Trinidad politician Jack Warner was suspended from soccer s governing body for an alleged connection to bin Hammam’s 2011 bribery case.
At the time, Warner was the longest-serving member of FIFA’s executive committee, according to the Guardian .
The Sunday Times is reportedly in possession of “millions” of documents and emails detailing money transfers from bank accounts controlled by bin Hammam and his associates.
Warner is among the alleged recipients.
Warner described claims of his connection with bin Hammam and an illegitimate 2022 World Cup as “foolishness” and a “witch hunt” organized by FIFA, according to the Guardian .
FIFA instituted a lifetime ban on bin Hammam in 2012, citing “repeated violations” of FIFA’s code of ethics, specifically relating to conflicts of interest, during his tenure as Asian Football Confederation President, according to a FIFA news release .
FIFA has been criticized for selecting Qatar for 2022’s summer tournament.
Average daily temperatures in June and July regularly eclipse 100 degrees, according to The Weather Channel’s website .
It was 108 degrees in Doha, Qatar earlier today, according to the website.
Concern over the effects the intense heat would have on fans and players led Blatter, the FIFA president, to suggest moving the 2022 tournament to winter months, possibly November, December or January, as reported by the BBC .
La Liga in Spain, the Bundesliga in Germany, and Serie A in Italy.
We can t just, on a whim, decide to move to the winter.
It s extremely difficult – nigh-on impossible in our view,” Premier League Chief Executive Richard Scudamore said in August 2013, as reported by ESPN .
No World Cup has ever been played outside of May, June or July, according to the BBC .
Qatar has also come under scrutiny for its labor conditions and treatment of migrant workers.
A Qatari census released last week  estimates that slightly more than 2 million people live in Qatar.
But an Amnesty International study  found that almost 94 percent of the country’s workforce is made up of migrant workers.
35 million people in Qatar are foreign nationals, according to the report.
Many migrant workers were contracted under a “kafala” system, according to the Guardian .
He told the Inside World Football website in September 2013 that “it may well be that we made a mistake” in selecting Qatar as host.
He also gave an interview on Swiss TV station RTS in May in which he described the decision as “an error,” according to Al-Jazeera .
Blatter.
Blatter denies that bribery played a role in the location decision.
Bin Hammam responded to the accusations in The Sunday Times with a statement that “the truth will find its way to  public one way or another,” according to CNN .
CNN was able to speak to Sunday Times Deputy Editor Sarah Baxter.
She said she believes the evidence against bin Hammam is overwhelming.
Bit by bit, we have been unraveling it, and finally we hit the mother lode,  Baxter said.  We ve seen millions of documents that prove without a shadow of doubt that corruption was involved.

IT LOOKS like a mismatch.
On one side are the authorities who run the world’s favourite game, only occasionally aided by governments and the police.
On the other, determined professional gangsters, intent on fixing matches and laundering money.
Their antics—such as the arrangement, in 2010, of a fake game between Bahrain and a bogus Togolese team—can seem ingenious, even amusing.
But their repertoire includes violence and blackmail as well as sophisticated betting software.
Several national leagues, notably China’s, have been severely discredited by their rackets.
All Europe’s big political institutions have inveighed against sports corruption.
Tax authorities, which in the past turned a blind eye to liabilities on player transfers and salaries, have belatedly begun to intervene, notably in Britain and Italy.
In Finland, one of several European countries in which criminals have taken over clubs for nefarious purposes, the sports ministry has helped to develop a smartphone app that lets players report match-fixing suspicions anonymously.
South Korean officials have banned scores of players after a scandal in which dozens were jailed.
Singapore has attracted criticism for what some see as a failure to crack down on gambling rings and notorious matchfixers.
But a Lebanese referee was recently jailed for six months there, one of three officials convicted of accepting sexual favours from a gambling syndicate in return for rigging a game  bribing referees with prostitutes is a time-honoured tradition .
The story elsewhere is less encouraging.
Football administrators say that catching criminals is the police’s job.
But police forces are hampered by the difficulty of proving match-fixing and the cross-border nature of the scams: satellite broadcasting and online gambling have created lucrative and manipulable new betting markets, especially in South-East Asia, making the game a prime target for international crooks.
Fuzzy jurisdiction means that forces tend to treat football crime as a “low priority”, says Chris Eaton, of the International Centre for Sport Security in Doha.
The biggest case to date centres on Bochum, Germany, where in 2011 a gang was convicted of rigging scores of matches in many countries.
But this was an accidental by-product of an inquiry into the Croatian mafia.
Interpol and Europol have taken an interest, but no one can compel blasé forces to act.
Punishments tend to be light.
Ralf Mutschke, head of security at FIFA, football’s global overseer, says match-fixing offers “low risk and high gain”.
FIFA’s critics think its global reach—broader than that of any police force—means it could do more itself.
It professes “zero tolerance” for match-fixing, pays for one of several schemes designed to detect suspicious betting, and issues worldwide bans to malefactors.
It has set up an online system for reporting corruption.
But other sports, such as tennis and cricket, have cracked down harder and faster.
And FIFA’s plan to loosen the licensing system for football agents  a few of whom connive in money-laundering and other offences , and its equivocal stance on third-party interests in players is seen by critics as evidence of complacency.
FIFA has also been shamed by a series of bribery and embezzlement scandals relating to the choice of venues for the World Cup and its relationship with marketing agencies.
Sylvia Schenk of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, argues that “without good governance, FIFA will have no credibility to tell players and referees that they have to stick to the rules”.
A much-vaunted reform has flopped.
Alexandra Wrage of TRACE International, an anti-graft outfit based in Maryland, resigned from an advisory committee: when the reforms touched on “sensitive issues at the highest levels”, such as term limits and transparency about officials’ salaries, “they stalled”, she says.
The outcome, says Damian Collins, a British MP who is critical of FIFA, is that “nothing has really changed”.
An internal report recently found that Sepp Blatter, the organisation’s president since 1998, had been “clumsy” in his response to evidence of a huge bribe that was destined for someone else.
Mr Blatter, who denies all wrongdoing, has clung on.
He is widely expected to run for a fifth term in 2015.
Because of its enormous popularity, wide range game play, financial success and global attendance, it s no surprise that there are going to be negative profiteers involved.
Corruption and deception will always be lurking.
No sports league is perfect.
Even Major League Baseball had the infamous Black Sox Scandal, the 1919 World Series.
Wilson Raj Perumal is one of the most infamous names in the soccer community today.
The 49-year-old from Singapore has been convicted multiple times for match fixing and bribing.
He has spent years behind bars for his actions and has been involved in multiple scandals.
In a recent interview reported by Matthew Karnitschnig of the Wall Street Journal , Perumal was in Hungary speaking against former connections and friends who took part in previous fixes.
Perumal explained that the majority of the games he fixed were friendlies and exhibition games.
He goes into specific detail in his book  Kelong King  how he was so successful for a long period of time.
Although Asia has had very little success at the World Cup, never having a single National Team qualify for a World Cup Final, it is believed to be the center of the corruption.
The sports betting that takes place in numerous Asian countries is generating extremely high amounts of revenue, illegally.
According to ESPN , Perumal was arrested in 2011.
He was carrying a false passport and was put under surveillance by police.
They watched him over the next few days talk to multiple players.
Eventually after his arrest, he opened up and confessed about his actions in the past.
In exchange for a lighter sentence, Perumal gave investigators a lot of information about his former associates and information on how the illegal betting works.
It was reported that Perumal had  rigged  more than 100 games spanning across five continents.
The World Cup has always been under some scrutiny in the past.
The 1978 World Cup has faced  controversy, as has the 1934 World Cup.
Both Argentina and Italy won those World Cups on their home soil.
Nothing has been officially proven with either of those two, but debates still continue on the integrity of those games.
The home team usually does significantly better during the World Cup.
Perumal was first arrested in 1995 for fixing games in his home country of Singapore.
Perumal didn t just place bets on soccer games.
He also placed money on NBA games, most notably the Chicago Bulls.
Everyone knows that the NBA has had an identity problem since the  Tim Donaghy Scandal.  Donaghy is a former NBA official who admitted to fixing games that he officiated.
Being the  middle man,  Perumal is at the most risk.
He is in direct contact with players, managers and officials.
FIFA is glad that he is finally rid of his match fixing days, but Perumal isn t the boss.
Perumal spent much of his time and did a lot business with Dan Tan, a match fixer himself who is now 50 years old.
Tan was in charge of their money travel.
Much of their financial gain came from China and South East Asia.
Tan has been arrested multiple times for illegally betting on numerous sports.
Tan was one of the men mentioned by Perumal to authorities when arrested in Finland.
The success of so many soccer betters remains because of low relevance of many games and location.
A lot of the fixed matches are friendlies and exhibitions.
The most notorious ones of course being the 2010 fake Togo game and  Asiagate  involving the Zimbabwe national team.
These games don t hold nearly the same amount global popularity or relevance as the World Cup, but the money is still there.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter has said constantly that the 2014 World Cup was  clean  and officiated properly.
There were reports  that Perumal had predicted the score of Cameroon-Croatia correctly in an online chat room, which ended 4-0.
This has not been proven, but it certainly raised some eyebrows.
With soccer being the most popular sport in the world, it will always have a number individuals and groups that will give it a bad name.
There s no proof or verification whatsoever that FIFA has any ties to this underground fixing corruption.

The Sunday Times of London blew the lid off the worst-kept secret in the world.
The 2022 World Cup was not just possibly bought by Qatar, it was absolutely, positively, unequivocally, how-did-they-get-away-with-it-for-this-long ingly  bought by Qatar.
Mohamed bin Hammam, once a high-ranking member of FIFA s executive cabal before being excommunicated from power after daring to run against Sepp Blatter for the role of FIFA president, has been implicated—again—for lobbying on behalf of Qatar in advance of the 2010 vote that awarded the 2022 World Cup to the tiny desert nation over the United States of America.
It s time for FIFA to correct this mistake, right this amazingly transparent wrong and take the World Cup back from Qatar.
Who should get it?
The United States, of course.
Move the World Cup?
Suddenly Sepp Blatter doesn t want to hear it.
The Times report from Jonathan Calvert and Heidi Blake claims to have obtained  millions of secret documents  that implicate Bin Hammam s role in buying votes for Qatar to win the World Cup bid.
Millions of documents.
Do you know how much paper that would be?
Even if each document was just one sheet, that would be 2,000 reams, but the report states that millions—plural—were uncovered, meaning that somewhere in the world there is a room with upward of 4,000 reams of paper implicating bin Hammam and his network of swindlers in paying off FIFA voters to give the World Cup to Qatar.
The paper trail of impropriety leads from the Middle East to the farthest reaches of the globe.
Technically the trail, if laid out sheet by sheet, would be about 350 miles long.
Now the Sunday Times, based on a massive leak from unnamed sources in FIFA, has assembled a picture of Bin Hammam flying around the world, including on the emir of Qatar s private jet, lobbying for the Qatar 2022 bid, dishing out cash gifts and lavish hospitality, to Warner, Temarii and African football delegates who appeared depressingly keen to take it.
Bin Hammam was a power player within FIFA for more than a decade and a half, serving as one of the most influential characters in the world of international football in his time as the president of the Asian Football Confederation.
That is, until 2012, when Bin Hammam, one of a host of executives planning a coup on Blatter s reign, was cast out in an effort to clean up FIFA s rampant corruption.
Of course, Blatter was spared in all of it.
And since the World Cup vote in 2010, Blatter has come out time and time again to question the decision to award Qatar that illustrious event.
Blatter, the man who has made it his life s work to grow the game of football in every corner of the globe, has washed his hands with this mess.
When asked by  Swiss television station  RTS if it was an error to award Qatar the World Cup, Blatter said:  Of course, it was a mistake.
You know, one makes a lot of mistakes in life.
The FIFA spin machine quickly tried to offer context, saying that Blatter meant the mistake was to put the World Cup in Qatar in the summer, but it was not a mistake to give Qatar the event at all.
Only, it was.
Blatter knows it was, and his recent comments were not the first time he s indicated that.
The simple fact that the FIFA committee had to formally look into the viability of hosting the event in Qatar in the traditional summer months—talk last year created a scenario in which the World Cup would be held in a cooler time of year, during domestic league play—made giving a World Cup to Qatar a bad idea.
Let s not forget the intolerant stance on homosexuality in Qatar, also making a World Cup in that nation a very bad idea.
Or what about the fact that Qatar has had 1,200 deaths to migrant workers, via Kevin Maguire of the Daily Mirror, a horrific problem that caused FIFA to take a far more hands-on approach to the stadium-building process?
A recent inspection, however, was postponed after Qatar put in place new workers  welfare standards.
This announcement is a significant step in the right direction for sustainable change in the workers  welfare standards in Qatar .
We look forward to seeing the implementation of these concrete actions over the next months.
We will continue our close cooperation with Qatari authorities as well as dialogue with all key stakeholders.
It was bought.
No matter how far Blatter tries to distance himself from the bribery and deceit—rumored for years before finally coming to light within the millions of pages the Times has procured—the 2022 World Cup will be Blatter s legacy.
And there is still time to fix it.
If a member of the FIFA selection process was given a free refill on a drink at some point in the last three years that could somehow connect him to Qatar, Blatter needs to find out and use it to burn him.
The damage has been done.
The house is crumbling.
He needs to help it fall.
The only way to fix the mistake of Qatar is to bury everyone who created it, end the ridiculous ruse that Qatar will be remotely ready to host a World Cup in 2022 or that the nation is even deserving of such an honor in the first place and move to a country more prepared.
The United States is prepared.
Right now.
The United States has more than 50 stadiums equipped to host World Cup events.
The travel and accommodations are already in place—no last-minute hotels without running water or windows or doors that won t open like Russia had during the Winter Olympics and that even Brazil is currently dealing with for the upcoming 2014 World Cup.
Is it about the money?
Is FIFA worried about the money?
The 1994 World Cup was the most successful tournament in the event s history in terms of cash-in for FIFA, and that was 20 years ago, when soccer had nothing close to the foothold in American culture it has today.
Imagine how big the sport is going to be in America in another eight years.
That interest will grow even more if the United States was given hosting rights in 2022.
If Blatter wants to grow the game, there is no nation with more growth potential for soccer than the United States.
Sure, there are already millions of young kids playing soccer here, and putting a World Cup in South Africa or Qatar  or even Russia  could help produce the infrastructure an influx of FIFA money can provide in those parts of the world, but that s all just money.
We have money.
Should Qatar host the 2022 World Cup?
Should Qatar host the 2022 World Cup?
Take all the millions upon billions of dollars it would cost to build stadiums and send it all to other nations to help grow the game there.
We don t need that money to build anything.
It s already here.
The United States is so prepared to host a World Cup that nearly half of the 32 teams in this year s tournament are training in the United States before heading off to Brazil.
We have the training facilities, we have the stadiums to hold the matches and we have a melting pot of people from around the world who love the beautiful game and will come out in droves to support a World Cup.
FIFA knows this.
Everyone knows this.
Everyone knew it in 2010, when the selection committee should have awarded the United States the right to host the 2022 event in the first place.
But money was more important than truly growing the game, and as more and more of those devious bastards involved in this elaborate bribery scandal are outed—as more and more millions of documents are uncovered—the time is right for the mistake to be formally corrected.
FIFA needs to give the 2022 World Cup to the United States.
Do it, and do it soon.
But don t do it for us.
Do it for the good of the game.
You can give the United States the 2022 World Cup in the winter of 2021 if you have to.
We ll be ready then, because we are ready now.
Do you want to share your Bleacher Report activity on Facebook?
A Qatari official poses with the World Cup trophy during a tour last year.
People are dying, and others got bribed.
People are dying because others got bribed.
The bribes are at the allegation stage, but the dying at the 2022 World Cup site in Qatar is real.
And I ll be honest: If I had to bet, I would bet the bribes are real, too.
This column wouldn t be written if I hadn t believed long ago that the 2022 World Cup was awarded to stiflingly hot, blatantly corrupt Qatar -- against all odds, against all common sense -- because large sums of money were exchanged.
Hell, lots of us thought it long before Sunday, when the Times of London reported that Qatar s former top football official -- the famously corrupt Mohamed Bin Hammam -- had bribed FIFA officials and their connections to land the 2022 World Cup.
Anyone who follows soccer in this country, football in others, instantly wondered how that could happen.
How could the World Cup go to such a miserably hot place, a place so lacking in infrastructure that hundreds of thousands of desperate workers had to be brought in from Nepal, 2,000 miles away, to work in deadly conditions?
The high in Qatar on Monday is expected to be 113 degrees.
It ll be 115 on Tuesday before a break provides a respite, with highs Wednesday and Thursday forecast at 105 degrees.
With lows in the upper 80s.
Workers are dying over there, more than 200 from Nepal alone in 2013 , with more than 4,000 migrant workers projected to die in Qatar by the time the football cathedrals and palaces are in place.
Media sites in football-fanatical London are leading the way in exposing the crimes being committed in Qatar, from the allegations Sunday of bribery in the Times to a story in September by The Guardian about the strong-arm tactics being used to force Nepalese workers to come to Qatar and dance with death for the sake of a football tournament.
The journalism is magnificent, but only because it has underscored just how ghastly the 2022 World Cup has become.
Now this.
The allegations, what so many of us already assumed to be true, about the corruption that brought the World Cup to Qatar in the first place.
FIFA is taking the allegations so seriously that its chief investigator, Michael Garcia, has already launched an investigation and its vice president, Jim Boyce, has indicated the 2022 World Cup could be moved from Qatar if Garcia finds proof of the bribes.
As far as that proof goes, the Times reported that it has documents -- seen also by BBC Sports Editor David Bond -- that Bin Hammam had made payments into accounts controlled by the leaders of 30 high-ranking African soccer officials to secure their support within FIFA for Qatar s bid.
Bin Hammam has been banned for life by FIFA twice, once after trying to bribe his way into the FIFA presidency in 2011, then again in 2012  after his first ban was overturned  for the unseemly way he ran the Asian Football Confederation s Champions League.
There isn t just smoke here, is my point.
Bin Hammam is a five-alarm fire of corruption, and they are his fingerprints on the alleged influence that obtained a World Cup for a country where workers are dying by the hundreds, and soon by the thousands if the 2022 World Cup isn t taken away.
Which it should be, of course.
The 2022 World Cup has to be moved if the allegations are proved true -- and even if they aren t; how many Nepalese should die just so Qatar can get ready for some football?
That s criminal.
It sounds something like murder to me.
Second degree, manslaughter, hell if I know, but something.
Indict  em all -- everyone who extended a bribe, everyone who accepted, everyone whose vote for Qatar was influenced by such a thing -- and let the court systems sort it out.
But not a court system in Qatar.
That place can t be trusted with something as trivial as a soccer stadium, much less something as substantial as justice for the dead.
We’re a little more than eight years away from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
Why are we talking about the 2022 Cup, when the 2014 tournament in Brazil is nearly upon us  and frankly, has a plethora of problems we could be discussing as well ?
Simple: With every day that passes, Qatar demonstrates how misguided and wrong FIFA was to award the oil-rich Middle Eastern nation one of the world’s greatest sporting honors.
Thus, before it’s too late, we implore FIFA and its members to strip Qatar of the World Cup.
FIFA: You’re making the world an accessory to mass murder, enslavement, trickery and bullshit.
Enough is enough.
Look:  There is precedent for changing the host nation of a World Cup tournament.
In 1974, Colombia was selected to host the 1986 iteration.
Due to “economic concerns,” Colombia resigned the opportunity in 1982, a mere four years before the event.
Mexico became the replacement and presented the Cup without issue.
Qatar, however, will be unlikely to give up their bid — thus, it must be taken from them.
I am a resident, came in second in FIFA voting and would be the obvious choice to replace Qatar.
I could not care less where the World Cup is held — unless it’s in Qatar.
AnywhereButQatar.
I just made that up.
Start trending it.
1.
It appears Qatar bought the bid.
The decision to award Qatar the World Cup was rotten from the jump.
Allegations of bribery have been rampant: Back in 2011, FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke wrote in an email that Qatar  “bought the right to host.
Recently, a story broke about the 10-year-old daughter of a former FIFA executive  receiving £2 million in her bank account three years ago.
Qatar even bought off French soccer legend  Zinedine Zidane , paying him $1 million to support their bid.
Some of these accusations  have been retracted , and much of the blame for these allegations lies with FIFA, which appears to be as corrupt as any sporting organization in the world.
But the fact remains: votes were almost certainly altered to favor Qatar, and that makes the selection illegitimate.
Saying “This happens all the time” is pretty shitty reasoning for keeping the Qatar selection intact.
2.
How many more people have to die so we can watch soccer?
A horrifying report released by the International Trade Union Confederation last month estimated that over 4,000 workers will die in the effort to build Qatar’s World Cup infrastructure.
Sadly, we already knew that Qatar treats its migrant  workers like slaves , with salt water given to them as refreshment and little done to improve reported unsanitary living and working conditions,  despite claims by Qatari officials to the contrary .
How many deaths are excusable in the name of building soccer stadiums?
Is even one death allowable?
If you’d give your life for this cause, please let me know; if not, explain why the lives of Nepalese and Indian workers, who have no one to speak for them save organizations like the ITUC, are worth less?
Hundreds have already died in the name of Qatar’s World Cup.
How many more before we consider this as bad as, say,  9 11 ?
3.
They’re breaking all the promises they made to secure the Cup in the first place  bribes aside .
Tony Manfred of Business Insider put together a damning collection of promises that Qatar made that are being broken one by one.
Qatar promised      12 World Cup stadiums, some of which would be broken down afterwards and      used to create soccer stadiums in developing countries around the world.
Now, Qatar will only build eight stadiums, the minimum required by FIFA       Brazil will use 12 stadiums; South Africa had 10 .
Addressing      concerns that it would be too hot to play soccer in the summer in Qatar,      officials promised a ground-breaking air-conditioning system in each      stadium.
The technology works,” they said at the time.
That means the      summer World Cup we’re all used to, and want, probably won’t happen,      because, duh, fucking soccer in the Middle East in July?
Here’s an analogy: I promised you I’d take your daughter to the prom, treat her well, and bring her home safely by midnight.
I show up at your house with a motorcycle sans helmets, wearing no watch, and a sleeve of condoms trails out of my back pocket.
They’re sheepskin condoms, too.
Feel duped?
You should.
4.
It’s going to ruin non-World Cup soccer for months.
There’s a reason the World Cup usually takes place in June and July: most major soccer leagues are on break by then.
It’s like how we have no problem with NBA players competing in the Summer Olympics, because it doesn’t take place during the NBA season.
Imagine if the NFL took off between Weeks 6 and 7, and we didn’t have American football for five weeks?
That’s what will happen to soccer if the Cup is moved to “November and December,” as is expected due to extreme heat in Qatar.
Great.
Hope the owners  and players  of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Juventus et al.
5.
It’s going to interfere with the American sports schedule.
Speaking of the NFL, how likely are you to watch a soccer match that coincides with an NFL game?
Answer: not very, unless you’re one of those guys who like soccer futbol more than football.
And we’ve got no problem with “those guys,” but one way to make sure 300-something million people from the United States are NOT watching your tournament is to put it on during NFL season.
Throw the NHL and NBA in there, and you’ll guarantee a sports-clusterfuck that will kill ratings for Fox Sports, which paid  $425 million for the rights to broadcast a  summer  World Cup.
Understand: I get that part of the reasoning for giving Qatar a World Cup was to show how non-Western countries could host a major soccer tournament.
But… this clearly isn’t working out.
At least not in Qatar.
05 million  or the United States?
6.
The longer we wait, the harder it will be for another nation to step in.
Mexico was able to take hosting duties for Cup from Colombia and put on a quality tournament within four years.
That doesn’t mean a four-year turnaround was the smart thing — it was the necessary thing.
The longer we wait to award this duty to another country, the more difficult it will be to handle all the logistics required.
We cannot wait until the last possible moment to do this.
It has to happen soon.
Let’s stop supporting this farce and give this honor to a country that won’t waste billions of dollars and countless lives on an ego trip.

Can committee stand up to the inevitable backlash?
The World Cup is about to kick off in Brazil, but FIFA is scrambling to save the 2022 game in Qatar that is caught up in a bribery scandal.
Mark Phillips reports.
QATAR 2022] The most amazing aspect of the Sunday Times  investigation into the Qatar 2022 bribery scandal is the enormity of the treasure trove.
It says it was leaked  hundreds of millions of secret documents  in Qatari Mohamed Bin Hammam s systematic campaign to win support for Qatar 2022 in Africa to the tune of more than $5 million from slush funds.
It didn t detail a smoking gun tying the Qatari bid committee directly to the four Africans on the FIFA executive committee but uncovered 10 slush funds used to buy up support within African soccer.
The magnitude of the corruption will be another blow to FIFA and the international view of it being a deeply flawed institution.
The Sunday Times, whose articles are behind a pay wall, reported that a  senior figure  inside FIFA decided to  blow the whistle  on Qatar 2022 and leaked it the documents, many of them it posted.
The evidence includes emails, faxes, phone records, flight logs, bank transfer slips and other documents and accounts all involving bin Hammam, the Qatari who was the president of the Asian Football Confederation and member of the FIFA executive committee at the time of the vote for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup in December 2010.
Bin Hammam was the next year kicked out of FIFA in a bribery scandal involving then-Concacaf president Jack Warner as he sought to win support in the Caribbean for his bid to unseat FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
A later investigation into bin Hammam s affairs at the Asian Football Confederation revealed all sorts of improprieties.
Much of that investigation is confirmed in the Sunday Times investigation as it determined bin Hammam used AFC accounts to access cash and his private construction company, Kemco, to funnel money to African officials seeking handouts.
Bin Hammam s goal was to gain a groundswell of support in Africa for the Qatar 2022 campaign so that the four executive committee members would have no choice but to support Qatar 2022.
Before the vote, Amos Adamu of Nigeria was suspended after being caught in a Sunday Times sting operation.
The other three Africans were Cameroonian Issa Hayatou, Egyptian Hany Abu Rida and Ivorian Jacques Anouma.
The Sunday Times said the Qatari bid committee was aware of the efforts to court African delegations on trips to Doha though it was not clear how much it knew about payments beyond travel expenses.
Qatar won the vote of the FIFA executive committee by 14-8.
It has pushed ahead with its plans for the 2022 World Cup though FIFA has yet to decide when to hold the tournament -- summer or winter.
Despite suggestions of a re-vote on the 2022 host, few believe it will take place without compelling evidence that the Qatar 2022 bid committee was directly involved in payoffs to members of the executive committee.
FIFA investigator Michael Garcia is scheduled to meet with Qatar 2022 bid committee officials this week.
It is not clear whether that meeting will go ahead in light of the new revelations.
Goerge Weah s kid has been a normal in our USBNT u15 and u14.
They should revoke the award to Qatar and start over.
If it was a normal appointment, it wouldn t be awarded until 2015.
What bothers me most is they won saying they could provide air conditioning in the soccer stadiums by 2022 and have since back off of that.
If conditions will not be as their bid suggested, it s time to start over!
I agree, Molly!
Even under the scandalous circumstances they should have a re-vote.
Sign in to leave a comment.
Don t have an account?
With the World Cup kicking off this Thursday, the month of June should be FIFA’s moment in the sun.
It all started on June 1, when The Sunday Times exposed that Mohamed bin Hammam, a former member of FIFA’s executive committee, had secretly bribed soccer officials worldwide nearly $5 million in an attempt to win votes for Qatar’s successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
Then, on Friday, Dave Zirin, The Nation sports columnist who recently published a book on the neoliberal policy behind the Brazil World Cup, made the case in the New York Times for kicking FIFA out of the sport altogether.
It is past time to abolish FIFA,” Zirin wrote.
7 million in exchange for their votes for Qatar.
The same report alleges that bin Hammam met with members of the Thai government to discuss multimillion-dollar gas contracts for the country’s support.
Even comedian John Oliver got in on the act.
On last night’s episode of “Last Week Tonight” on HBO, he took FIFA to task for its latest wave of corruption and bribery scandals.
The Qatar World Cup is shaping up to be the most deadly Middle East construction project since this one,” said Oliver, gesturing to a graphic of the Egyptian pyramids.
Like Zirin, Oliver condemned the construction of a $300 million stadium in the middle of the Amazon rainforest—one that probably won’t be used after the World Cup.
The negative publicity has been so overwhelming that even some of the World Cup’s biggest and longest-serving sponsors, including Adidas and Sony, have expressed concern.
The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,” a spokesman for Adidas told The Guardian.
Perhaps corporate pressure will accomplish what mockery and muckraking have failed to do: convince FIFA to reform.

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association  FIFA  is the global governing body for soccer.
With 209 member associations around the world, FIFA is responsible for promoting the game globally and for organising international competitions; spearheaded by the FIFA World Cup, an international soccer tournament held every four years.
The 2014 FIFA World Cup, currently under way in Brazil, has 32 national teams vying for the coveted World Cup trophy and millions around the world tuning in to watch the event.
However, behind the scenes, FIFA faces fresh allegations of bribery and corruption in relation to the bidding process that resulted in the selection of Russia and Qatar as World Cup host countries in 2018 and 2022.
How are host cities for the World Cup determined?
In 2009, FIFA received bids from 11 countries to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cup events.
For 2018, these included England and Russia and joint bids from Portugal and Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.
For 2022, the bids came from Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea and the United States.
Nations often spend millions of dollars to be considered as a World Cup host city.
6 million in federal funds was provided for Australia’s 2022 submission.
Of the 24 FIFA executive committee members, 22 were considered eligible to vote in 2010 after two were found to have accepted bribes and were suspended.
Ultimately, Russia won the ballot for 2018 with 13 of the 22 votes, and Qatar won for the 2022 event with 14 votes.
Qatar is a small, wealthy country in the Middle East and the first Arab country to host the World Cup.
Australia received only 1 vote and England, 2.
FIFA’s announcement was met with scepticism: many in the media questioned the integrity of the voting process and alleged that the World Cup had been sold to the highest bidder.
Others were mystified by Qatar’s success given its searing summer heat and lacklustre footballing history.
What are the current allegations?
While allegations of bribery and corruption have plagued FIFA for years, British newspaper, The Sunday Times, recently published “proof” in the form of leaked documents.
The cache of emails, allegedly from a “senior FIFA insider”, revealed that former FIFA executive committee member, Mohamed bin Hammam paid more than $5 million to secure support for Qatar’s 2022 World Cup bid.
In 2012, the FIFA ethics committee had banned Mr bin Hammam, a Qatari national, from all football activities over “conflicts of interest”.
According to the evidence, Mr Hammam reportedly lavished cash payments, gifts and trips upon FIFA’s executive and African officials in exchange for their votes.
However, Qatar has denied any wrongdoing and has distanced itself from Mr bin Hammam, saying he was “not a member of Qatar’s bid team”.
The revelations came as no surprise to many, and merely confirmed what had long been suspected: that Qatar’s successful bid had been “bought”.
The scandal has thrown the spotlight onto FIFA’s secretive voting procedures and general lack of transparency.
Many World Cup sponsors, such as Adidas, Visa, Sony, and Coca Cola have also expressed concern; calling for the allegations to be investigated appropriately.
Who is Sepp Blatter?
Born in Switzerland in 1936, Joseph “Sepp” Blatter was first elected president of FIFA in 1998, then subsequently re-elected in 2002, 2007 and 2011.
However, his controversial tenure has been dogged by allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement.
Nevertheless, despite the allegations, Mr Blatter has astounded many by announcing his intention to nominate for president again in 2015.
Many have questioned Mr Blatter’s authority; voicing concern about the way he is handling the corruption allegations.
He has been heavily criticised for stating publicly that the exposure of the story in the British press was motivated by “discrimination and racism” as well as a desire to “destroy FIFA” as an institution.
Chairman of Britain’s Football Association, Greg Dyke, described Mr Blatter’s statements as “offensive” and “totally unacceptable”.
He is among many who have called on the president to resign.
They say that as president, Mr Blatter is responsible for FIFA’s management and therefore inextricably connected to all its operations.
They claim his continued presence is damaging both the game and FIFA’s standing as an organisation.
Is the matter being investigated?
Prominent US lawyer, Michael Garcia, was appointed to lead the investigations arm of the FIFA ethics committee in 2012 following numerous allegations of corruption and pressure placed upon Mr Blatter.
His gaze is now focused upon unravelling the corruption allegations relating to the 2018 and 2022 bidding process.
He is expected to deliver his final report in July.
Many argue that if the allegations are proven correct, the bidding process for 2022 should be re-opened; despite the fact that Qatar has several World Cup projects already under way.
Others say that if FIFA refuses a revote, it could lead to open revolt, with major national football associations such as England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain boycotting the next World Cup - a move that would encourage others to follow - or, withdrawing from FIFA altogether to found a new governing body that is transparent and accountable.
They ask: why should FIFA be exempt from public scrutiny, given its mission is to enhance the game of soccer for all?
However, while change is considered crucial for FIFA’s survival - including a change of leadership - many fear that it is only through external pressure from the media, sponsors, football associations, football fans and governments, that it is likely to occur.
This scandal has the potential to taint not just an already discredited organisation, but world football and all sport.
The World Cup in Brazil will no doubt be as thrilling and captivating as these competitions always are, and we wish it well.
I think FIFA need another vote.
FIFA is] ugly and people need to know it.
FIFA today is a multinational that is eating up the ball.
There is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup.
Sadly there’s a great deal of discrimination and racism and this hurts me.
It really makes me sad… We are in the situation where we need leadership.
The allegations being made have nothing to do with racism, they are allegations about corruption within FIFA.
These allegations need to be properly investigated and properly answered.
What is the way forward for FIFA?
Should Mr Blatter remain as President?
How damaging are corruption allegations for the sport in general?

Days after attempting to enter parliament dressed in a niqab, a motorbike helmet and a ku klux klan outfit, they talk to Channel Ten.
FIFA hasn’t been known for being particularly just and proper in its actions in recent decades.
There have been countless occasions of corruption, scandals and other awful scenarios from FIFA over the years, even though it is in charge of the world’s most popular sport.
The unclean nature of FIFA has not consistently been the subject of headlines worldwide.
The current issues surrounding Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup, however, thoroughly changed those dynamics.
What about this particular controversy is so special that FIFA’s corruption is finally being discussed publicly, that its dubious decision-making processes are finally the subject of intense speculation and debate worldwide?
It’s a rather nuanced story, one whose significance can be processed slightly better if one understands the multiple facets that have shaped it, from the original bidding process up to the current speculation that the location of the 2022 World Cup will be moved.
It began approximately 4 years ago, in December 2010, when FIFA announced that Qatar won the vote to host the 2022 World Cup.
There were many negative initial reactions to the announcement, especially from the British after their bid for England failed.
Qatar was a random, tiny state with no known affinity for soccer — certainly not to the degree of the British anyway.
What was the only thing it seemed to have going for it?
Well, it was particularly oil-rich, making it an attractive location for investors of all kinds.
Indeed, in 2013, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said the vote could have been affected by “direct, political influence” from countries who had economic interest in Qatar.
A substantial portion of those who voted “yes” were European countries that would fit this bill.
In the larger scheme of things, however, these allegations only began scratching the surface in a relatively harmless manner.
The corruption theme took flight a few months after the vote, when Qatar’s representative on FIFA’s executive council, Mohammed Bin Hammam, was accused of bribery in his attempt to win votes for the FIFA presidential election and was banned from soccer.
Reports emerged of Bin Hammam’s various bribes and uncertainty arose as to whether some of these could have been for the World Cup bid.
No direct connection has been made, but the fact that FIFA has not put down these allegations either has helped to strengthen the potential that Qatar bribed its way to the World Cup.
Problems with the practicality of actually having the World Cup have put both FIFA and Qatar under further strain.
Qatar is an intensely hot country; in the summer, it is not rare for temperatures to be within the range of 100 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
For its part, Qatar has been working on cooling technologies for the stadiums and some visitor sites.
However, the success of these untested technologies cannot be guaranteed, and there’s only so much of the country that can be cooled down for the sake of fans.
Qatar’s conservative nature has also led to outcries, particularly regarding alcohol policies.
Qatar was handed its most difficult issue when the Guardian released an article in 2013 that detailed the abuse and exploitation of migrant workers, who have been branded by some as modern-day slaves.
These workers build the stadiums that Qatar will need to host the World Cup as well as related infrastructure projects.
According to the report, these workers were provided with scant resources, minimal pay, and were essentially barred from going home after having their passports taken and vacations fined.
The report cited by the article projected that 4,000 migrant workers could die due to these projects by the time the World Cup takes place in 2022.
Blatter has noted that FIFA has some responsibility for issues like these, but believes they are primarily the responsibility of the state of Qatar.
To put it in other words, FIFA will not intervene.
Of course, that’s not to say that the idea of the World Cup in Qatar is completely atrocious.
On the surface, there are some nice sides to the story; in most cases, however, the flip side of the coin does negate any positive contribution to the larger situation.
The idea of one of the 22 Arab countries finally getting a chance to host such an important tournament on the international stage is pleasant.
The ideal view is that FIFA is working to expand the popularity of the beautiful sport of soccer.
The reality, however, leans more towards FIFA’s desire to reach into untouched markets and increase profit.
Qatar has been trying to find ways to get around its conservative nature for the sake of fans; for example, it is arranging a system where fans would be able to access alcohol.
It has been open to ideas thrown its way, such as having the World Cup in the winter.
Unfortunately, this is problematic for domestic soccer leagues and other sports competitions that usually run during this time.
The Qataris do also have arguments they use to distance themselves from the FIFA corruption aspect of the controversy.
Officially, they note that Bin Hammam was Qatari but not part of the Qatari bidding committee; unofficially, there is also the fact that bidding has been a corrupted process for the longest time.
That doesn’t necessarily make any Qatari bribing better, but it does indicate that they shouldn’t be singled out for it; FIFA should probably be held just as, if not more accountable, for the nature of these dealings.
This mess of problems has come to the point where FIFA seems to be attempting to withdraw from the original decision to let Qatar have the World Cup.
More recently, executive committee member Theo Zanzwiger seems to have begun the climax of the story by proclaiming his belief that the World Cup will in fact be moved from Qatar.
Blatter has supported Qatar half-heartedly, and would gladly follow through with moving the competition in light of his upcoming re-election campaign.
At this point, though, it feels as if there are more questions than answers.
Should FIFA be more responsible for the host nations and hold them more accountable?
For that matter, is Qatar or FIFA more at fault for the issues that have come up?
Is there some way to have an acceptable World Cup in Qatar, or will someone always be dissatisfied?
With so many questions, there are only two possible outcomes: either the competition will remain in Qatar, or it will be moved.
There will be displeased parties in either scenario, but what about FIFA?
Its reputation has been tarnished, but will it successfully run away from this situation like others in the past?
Will its corruptness as an institution continue to be the norm, something inevitable that soccer fans worldwide must deal with?
Truthfully, it doesn’t seem like FIFA will change anytime soon.
Although much has happened, that may be the most daunting reality underlying it all.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the host nation for the FIFA World Cup 2022, in Zurich, Dec.
2, 2010.
A bribery scandal may cost the Middle Eastern nation the tournament.
Qatar, the tiny Gulf monarchy that has spent most of the last decade punching above its weight, is in danger of losing the 2022 World Cup – and with it a peerless showcase for its global aspirations.
This is the one way a country can literally be the center of the world for a month,” says Laurent Dubois, a Duke University professor of Romance studies who has written a book on the politics of the World Cup.
So revoking the 2022 selection of Qatar – as at least one senior FIFA official has suggested could happen – and re-opening the competition for a host nation would strike a huge blow to the country’s prestige.
And after raising its global profile by investing lavishly in museums, satellite news, and universities, Qatar lately has been already coping with a string of setbacks: the Muslim Brotherhood governments it supported in Egypt and the Gaza Strip are either removed or on their heels , while the rebels it arms in the Syrian civil war are losing to forces aligned with President Bashar Assad.
Meanwhile correspondents for its satellite news channel Al Jazeera remain jailed in Cairo.
The regional situation hasn’t gone very well for Qatar in the last year, so the World Cup becomes that much more important,” says Shadi Hamid, a fellow at the Brookings Institution Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington.
So much is tied to the success of the World Cup, whether it’s building new hotels, or building an entire metro system from scratch, all of that is to prepare for the World Cup in eight years.
Qatari officials emphatically deny authorizing any bribery, insisting that Mohamed bin Hammam, the official at the heart of the Sunday Times’ devastating e-mail cache, was not involved in the official effort to land the tournament.
Still, the Cup was already a source of controversy for Qatar.
2 million people, and whom human rights groups say are so badly exploited that a number have lost their lives on the job – prompting a promise from FIFA to push for better conditions .
The country’s climate is also a problem: temperatures in June and July, when the Cup is played, reach 120 degrees, raising the question of shifting the tournament to a cooler time of year.
S.
Treasury official Jonathan Schanzer tweeted about the Taliban prisoners released from Guantanamo into Qatari custody in exchange for Sgt.
But the corruption allegations play to an image of a petroleum-drenched monarchy so wealthy it simply buys whatever it wants.
And they come just as as FIFA is already reeling from a match-fixing scandal, and controversy over the $11 billion Brazil is spending, amid widespread poverty and social ills.
It’s like the pigeons coming home to roost a little bit,” says Dubois, who teaches a course on the World Cup.
There’s no justification for FIFA having so little transparency, except corruption.
Really, if you think about it.
Their job is to organize soccer games.
Yet the global body has answered only to itself for so long that it’s difficult to imagine it casting aside its choice of Qatar, even in the face of documents that the newspaper says number over a million.
On the one hand it seems to be inevitable that they’ll revisit the decision,” Dubois says.
It’s just as hard for Hamid, who worked in Brookings’ Doha office for the last four years, to fathom the loss to the host country.
It would really be devastating, I think,” Hamid says.
GEORGE WEAH, a strange bedfellow in Liberian politics who made a name on the political stage for the first time in 2005 and has since become a household name in Liberian politics along with and his supporters are by now yearning for state power hoping that a 2017 election without incumbent President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will lead to a smooth Weah’s victory.
WEAH’S SUPPORTERS CONTEND that he is the best choice for the presidency because he is clean of corruption as even many ordinary Liberians believe that only those who work in government are corrupt and since Weah has never held a full time government job, he is free of corruption and should be trusted with the presidency.
THE CONGRESS FOR Democratic Change Vice Chairman for Operations Mulbah Morlu recently inferred that the CDC welcomes into the party individuals who do not have stains of corruption.
WELCOMING DR.
FODAY Kromah into the CDC, Morlu described Kromah as a man who worked in a corrupt regime, but was not involved in corrupt activities.
This is a man that spent his professional years serving in corrupt government, but did not commit corruption”.
OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES including the CDC have all used corruption as a tool against the current regime, promising that when elected to state power, they will fight corruption.
FOR WEAH HIS supporters say he has no corruption in his DNA and so can make the difference in Liberia when elected President.
REVELATIONS ABOUT WEAH’S alleged involvement in the leaked report regarding the Qatar 2022 world cup bid have no doubt tainted his image and could do so during the rest of his political career.
THE FIFA SCANDAL is worldwide and an individual aspiring for the highest office of the country, the presidency in a country noted for systematic corruption should be above the fray before brining changes in the fight against corporation on the national level.
EVEN President ELLEN Johnson Sirleaf who until becoming President spoke against the same menace, has fallen prey to it, failing to fight corruption head-on, therefore Weah’s purported involvement in the FIFA scandal strongly suggests that he will make no difference in the fight against corruption on home soil when elected President.
An email communication from George Weah to bin Hammam s assistant, Najeeb Chirakal stated.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING the Qatar scandal presents a different picture of the soccer legend as a scandal of such international nature means, Weah is not free of corruption and moving unto the Presidency provides another risky chance for Liberia in fighting corruption.
FOR HIM, HIS entire career has been in football until 2005 when he turned to politics so his alleged involvement in corruption in football means Liberia cannot be guaranteed a corruption free country under the reign Weah as President.
WEAH AND HIS supporters are now compelled to find another campaign tool other than clean record from corruption given that using that fight corruption during campaign periods has paid off as Madam Sirleaf used the fight against corruption as a major component of her platform in 2005.
FIFA s report was originally supposed to be delivered in July.
FIFA s report on corruption charges surrounding the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups  has been delayed until at least September.
Originally, FIFA investigator Michael Garcia said he would have the report submitted to Joachim Eckert -- the judge for the adjudicatory chamber of the Ethics Committee -- by late July.
The reason for the delay was not made public, but it s entirely possible that it s simply taking longer to gather information than had been assumed.
How important these findings ultimately are is also unknown.
Although findings of overt corruption would be damning in the court of public opinion, the report will not be made public.
Whatever is included in the report could potentially lead to formal legal proceedings if FIFA decides to pursue them, but FIFA President Sepp Blatter has insisted that only the FIFA executive committee has the power to strip Russia or Qatar of their hosting rights so the biggest hammer that could fall on Russia or Qatar still belongs to FIFA.
Eckert is apparently able to at least suggest sanctions against any of the nine countries who actually submitted bids for the two World Cups in question.
What kinds of sanctions those could be is unclear.

Blame FIFA.
Brazilians unhappy with the cost of hosting the World Cup may  do what was once unthinkable: root against their own national team.
On the television in the kitchen of the Ipanema house that his father bought in the 1960s and that Marinho has been trying to sell for years, the Brazilian national team was slouching toward a 1–0 win against Serbia in a World Cup tune-up.
Nobody in the kitchen gave a damn about the result.
The TV was on out of habit, and they seemed annoyed to have to endure what had come to represent the great national bugbear.
At one point, Ronaldo appeared on screen to do commentary.
Everyone in the kitchen hissed.
Marinho said.
In the São Paulo stadium, Brazilian fans were booing Neymar.
Brazilians, the most happy-go-lucky, most soccer-loving people in the world, were jeering their own team on the eve of the World Cup.
How had it come to this?
FIFA is how.
Oh, and another thing: FIFA doesn t care.
Every four years, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, a Swiss bank that occasionally stages soccer games, alights on a country for a month or so to plunder as much bullion as possible.
In 2010, the target was South Africa, where FIFA wrung max dollars from government deals and compelled the construction of stadiums—several of which may never again be filled—in a country with some of the highest income inequality in the world.
6 billion of taxpayer money has gone toward stadium construction in a country that can no better afford such expenditures .
The event s overall price tag is somewhere north of $11 billion .
Women sipped caipirinhas while the military stood by to rain shells on the mass of humanity that might pour from the hills.
Soccer, as the cliché goes, is a religion in Brazil, and futebol has always channeled the national id.
This World Cup, unfortunately, represents something ugly: a system rigged by crooked politicians and greedy corporations, which existed here before Sepp Blatter and his cronies arrived; they just made it worse.
And sin of sins, they conscripted the Brazilian team for their mission.
They took the Seleção away from the people.
FIFA is essentially its own nation-state, one untethered to any particular jurisdiction but powerful enough to impose its governing architecture on actual countries.
In South Africa, FIFA demanded that the parliament pass legislation to ensure that nettlesome things like labor regulations didn t interfere with business.
In Brazil, FIFA made the host country ignore its own law prohibiting alcohol sales in stadiums  to prevent rowdies from getting too sauced  so World Cup sponsor Budweiser can push its suds.
Stadium exclusion zones , another tactic from the South Africa playbook, surround the venues.
Inside them, only FIFA-approved products can be sold.
Dissent is smothered by Big Macs and Adidas apparel.
Free speech, also restricted, could be met with something more menacing, especially given the way World Cup protestors in Brazil have been treated so far, which is with rubber bullets and tear gas .
When I went down to the famous Maracanã stadium in Rio a week before the first game, I found dozens of body-armor-wearing, black-clad special police waiting to pound the dirt out of any favela punk who dared take a run at the outer perimeter.
Treating sporting spectacles like military exercises is nothing new.
It happens at every Olympics and World Cup now.
But this feels different.
In the run-up to Thursday’s opening match, it appeared that Brazil s government might, in fact, be prepping for a revolution.
Gun-toting men were all over Rio—apparently more than 150,000 members of the police and armed forces had been deployed for the World Cup—including what appeared to be a full platoon of soldiers in a convoy to protect the Netherlands team as it went to and from its beachfront hotel.
One afternoon, a Brazilian Navy ship began patrolling Ipanema Beach directly in front of the hotel.
It was an incongruous sight: women sipping caipirinhas in thongs and men playing soccer volleyball in Speedos while the military stood by to rain shells on the mass of humanity that might pour from the hills at any moment.
It was much harder to detect what revolutionary spirit remained among Brazilians after a year of protests, some of them violent.
People seemed more apathetic than anything.
Resigned.
The unrest from the past year, even from a few months ago, was nowhere to be seen.
Coopted by labor unions and political parties, the movement s grassroots energy had dissipated.
I had to beg off an assignment to cover the protests because I couldn’t find any, just a counter-FIFA gathering that sounded more like a hipster art installation with popcorn and drinks.
The Globo TV network had initiated saturation World Cup coverage, sometimes just showing a team bus idling in a parking lot for several minutes: a long shot, no cuts—just a bus.
Around town, shops had begun to string little Brazilian flags from the rafters, but this was a far cry from World Cups of the past, when the streets would be painted green and yellow.
Not many people were wearing Brazil jerseys.
It felt embarrassing now.
Although the mood was far from celebratory, it had begun to brighten as fans from around the world arrived.
At the Christ the Redeemer statue , a dozen groups from different countries were jubilant.
This is what FIFA counts on.
But few teams in the history of the World Cup have been under as much pressure as Brazil faces in 2014.
If they start winning, the party will crank up and the troubles will be forgotten, at least until FIFA can hightail it out of town.
The question, of course, is what happens if Brazil loses?
Better: What if Brazil loses to, say, Uruguay in the quarterfinals, a dire result that some Brazilians are rooting for?
The last time the World Cup was staged here, in 1950, Brazil lost in the final to the Uruguayans , an outcome that, I’m told, provoked a period of ritual cutting that has yet to end.
That seems a little much considering Brazil s five World Cup wins since.
But Brazilians were mourning more than a match in 1950.
Winning that tournament was supposed to herald the arrival of the country as a dynamic force on the world stage.
Instead, Brazil tilted toward totalitarianism and a bit more than a decade later was mired in a military dictatorship .
But Brazil is not going to lose this time, not according to the Brazilians I met.
It had all been arranged.
That s how disenchanted they were.
The fix was in.
The Seleção would win, but why should anyone cheer?
A trophy was nothing to hope for, since it meant victory for FIFA and a broken system.
But FIFA would win, because that s what multinational corporations do everywhere, even the ones that claim to be nonprofits .
There would be no revolution.
People here had started to realize this.
The only way for Brazil to win was for Brazil to lose.
And how could that happen?
On Thursday morning, the day of the opening match, a group of protesters in São Paulo are supposed to march on the stadium.
Three thousand people are predicted to show up but that is just a guess.
Nobody knows if it will be a last gasp or a way of reigniting resistance.
Perhaps it all depends on who wins that opening game between Brazil and Croatia.
If the Brazilians were to lose, somehow, would millions take to the streets?
And would that really be cause for despair, or might it represent the biggest victory Brazil could hope for over the next five weeks?

Long-standing accusations of corruption in the International Federation of Association Football  FIFA , the world soccer governing body, have picked up traction lately, forcing two top officials in the organization to step aside in light of accusations that they offered $40,000 bribes to two dozen officials in an attempt to buy their votes for the presidency.
According to The New York Times , the accusations come from a high-ranking American against the officials, who hail from Qatar and Trinidad and Tobago.
FIFA’s alleged atmosphere of widespread rule-breaking were highlighted in Qatar’s stunning awarding of the 2022 World Cup, which was plagued by rumblings of vote-selling.
Eight of FIFA’s 24 executive committee members were accused of selling or attempting to sell votes for that World Cup, as well as the 2018 event that went to Russia.
Two officials have been suspended, but four have been cleared.
Said the FIFA general secretary: “It’s sad.

Blatter is using the World Cup to start his re-election bid for next year, when he will be 79.
Sao Paulo as he met with soccer officials from Asia, Africa and South America.
So what has Blatter done with that fire so far?
For one, he has increased spending on personnel, management and the FIFA ruling bodies, to about 21 percent of all expenses in 2013 from about 17 percent in the years 1999 to 2002.
That s more than the 14 percent of revenue that FIFA spends on what it calls  development : aid programs for national soccer associations, women s soccer, charity and education projects.
It s as if FIFA were a country where the central bureaucracy absorbs more money than health, education and subsidies to poorer regions put together.
Blatter has been no visionary in sports terms.
His tenure has yielded a few minor rule changes, notably one that penalizes players for pulling off their T-shirts after scoring a goal.
Some changes were quickly reversed.
In 2007, for example, FIFA banned games at stadiums more than 8,200 feet above sea level.
It then raised the limit to 9,840 feet and was forced to grant an exception to Bolivia s main stadium.
By contrast, Blatter s predecessor, Joao Havelange, boosted FIFA s membership from 142 to 204 federations, and recast the rules in ways that made the game more dynamic and enjoyable to watch -- and less rough.
Blatter has also done little to combat the corruption that flourished under Havelange, who was proved to have taken bribes and forced out as FIFA s honorary president last year.
Blatter has worked at FIFA since 1975, having joined the organization a year after Havelange s election.
Judging from a trove of documents recently published by London s Sunday Times, which offer evidence supporting allegations of corruption surrounding Qatar s bid to host the 2022 World Cup, he s perhaps not the best man to dismantle the darker part of Havelange s legacy.
At best, Blatter has succeeded as a cynical weather vane of a politician.
In a 2010 interview , he said he was fully behind FIFA s decision to play the 2022 World Cup in Qatar in June and July, the equivalent of playing on a frying pan in hell.
Now, he claims the decision was a  mistake    One makes lots of mistakes in life   and says he has recommended that the tournament be staged in the  slightly  cooler Qatari winter.
Blatter will consider it his legacy that, during his tenure, a World Cup was played in South Africa, and that Eastern Europe  Russia  and the Arab world  Qatar  also got their chances.
Rulers who do not know how to say goodbye are usually good at symbolism.
Blatter could have done much more for soccer federations in developing nations, giving them a bigger share of FIFA s sponsorship and TV-rights revenue, and making sure they weren t run by thieves.
The often greedy and unscrupulous soccer officials from poor countries are, however, Blatter s political base.
They will support his re-election next year if his campaign does not collapse under the weight of corruption investigations.
Blatter says accusing them of unsavory practices is  racist,  a profoundly lame attempt to distract attention from the type of petty bribery that the Sunday Times documents reveal.
Not even kings rule until they die these days.
The abdication of King Juan Carlos boosted respect for the monarchy in Spain.
No matter how much  fire  he has left in him, Blatter, too, should go -- if only to save FIFA s reputation.

So how does a country get a sports event like Soccer’s World Cup?
Apparently, the country has to give all sorts of guarantees that the governing body of the sports organization is treated like royalty.
Some members of the governing body may get more than just the royal treatment.

The 2014-2015 NBA Season is as wide open as ever.
The Qatar World Cup was bought?
No way!
Ever since the World Cup in 2022 was awarded to Qatar in late 2010, there have been rumblings and suspicions of corruption in the process.
Since then, we have also had reports of human rights abuses with laborers, and plenty of discussion about the heat.
It was just a matter of time before the smoking guns began emerging.
12 years is a long time to cover something up before it happens.
The only surprising thing about this is the amount of money.
Only £3 million in bribes to secure the massive event seems low, at least from the Qatari end, with the power in the country awash in money.
It goes to show just how susceptible FIFA was to bribes.
The key figure is Mohamed Bin Hammam , former Asian Football Confederation President, who is reported to be behind the payments.
Bin Hammam was banned in 2011 after it was discovered that he was trying to bribe officials in a bid to get elected as FIFA President, so reports of his activities in securing the Qatari vote should not be a surprise.
FIFA Vice President Jim Boyce has come out and said he would support a re-vote if allegations of corruption are proven.
FIFA investigator Chief Investigator Michael Garcia is already conducting an investigation into the allegations, and is already set to meet with the 2022 organizing committee on Monday.
Expect the committee to distance itself from Bin Hammam.
Sad sack meets sad sack.
The rumors are true!
A very bad football team; a very angry sports talk radio host.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter is seen on a big screen as he delivers a speech during the opening ceremony of the 65th FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo June 11, 2014.
SAO PAULO  Reuters  - FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Wednesday all but confirmed he would run for re-election despite criticism that the game and organisation have been tarnished by accusations of corruption during his long reign.
World soccer s governing body is reeling after allegations in Britain s Sunday Times that a former top FIFA representative made payments to officials as part of a campaign to win support for Qatar s successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
Yet Blatter, who has led FIFA for 16 years, made no direct reference to the scandal throughout Wednesday s annual Congress, and instead pressed his case to extend his tenure.
FIFA s 209 member associations at the close of Congress, held in Sao Paulo on the eve of the opening game of Brazil s 2014 World Cup.
Blatter, who ignored calls made this week by European countries not to run again in next year s FIFA election, enjoys the support of enough delegates to have his way.
Earlier at the Congress, the lawyer investigating allegations of corruption surrounding FIFA said he would leave no stone unturned in a bid to dispel concerns that the probe would not take into account key evidence that recently came to light.
Michael Garcia handed in a report this week on the findings from nearly two years of work, but told FIFA delegates it did not signal the end of his investigation.
The Sunday Times newspaper reported recently that some of the  millions of documents  it had seen linked payments by former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam to officials to win backing for Qatar s World Cup bid.
Bin Hammam has not commented on his involvement since he was banned for life from soccer in 2012, while Qataris working on the project say he was not a part of their official bid.
Garcia said he and his team already had access to the  vast majority  of those documents, and hoped to see the rest soon.
FIFA.
Garcia added that his team would consider any fresh material provided to them, but would not delay the publication of the final report indefinitely.
He is due to submit it to German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of the Ethics Committee s adjudicatory chamber, in about six weeks and, if he finds corruption, Qatar could be stripped of the Cup, or at least face a challenge to its position as host either through a re-vote or other processes.
Allegations over Qatar s bid overshadowed the buildup to the World Cup, yet they were barely mentioned at FIFA s Congress.
Member associations and confederations were promised  extraordinary success premiums  after a profitable financial year, and Blatter even threw in a surprise in the form of a proposal to introduce radical new rules to the game.
While only an informal suggestion at this stage, he proposed allowing managers to appeal against refereeing decisions up to twice each game, using video footage to settle the issue.
The mood at this year s Congress has been unusually subdued, with statements from regional groupings underlining deep divisions in an organisation that controls the world s most popular sport and billions of dollars in advertising revenues and television rights.
Senior soccer officials from Europe, concerned that FIFA s image was being irrevocably damaged by scandals that have dogged it for years, told Blatter bluntly that he should not run again.
Blatter told reporters after the meeting.
He declined to comment on remarks by David Triesman, former head of English soccer s governing body, who told the upper house of Britain s parliament that FIFA was corrupt and any investigations it conducted into itself were cover-ups.
FIFA, I m afraid, behaves like a mafia family.
Triesman.
A FIFA spokesman declined to comment on the remarks.
The peer was for a while in charge of England s unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup.
As European soccer lined up against Blatter, he won overwhelming support during meetings with delegates from Africa, Asia, Oceania and beyond, suggesting that he would comfortably win an election should he decide to take part.
Underlining the anger at this year s Congress over the Qatar allegations, the head of the Congolese Football Association attacked what he said was  a calumnious campaign against African football .
Omari Selemani also played down the role of African nations in voting to hold the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
The  ignorant  British media has led the attacks on Qatar, he said in a speech days after the Sunday Times published the second in a series of reports putting African soccer bosses at the centre of bribery allegations to secure the 2022 tournament for the tiny Gulf nation.
The rows over Qatar and Blatter s future have diverted much of FIFA s attention away from the Brazil World Cup, which opens on Thursday with the hosts taking on Croatia.
Nothing but a win will do for a country that many people consider the spiritual home of soccer, and victory on the pitch might generate more excitement off it after a surprisingly subdued buildup to the tournament.

Many Brazilians believe the money spent on building new stadiums in cities that only have small local teams should have gone instead to improving social services.
Support for hosting the World Cup has fallen from nearly 80 percent in 2008 to less than 50 percent this year, according to pollster Datafolha.

The German judge also suggested on Friday it was not his job to remove Russia or Qatar as hosts or order a re-vote based on FIFA prosecutor Michael Garcia s investigation.
In giving his first detailed insight on a case likely to define FIFA s attempts to repair its scandal-ridden image, Eckert pushed back the expected deadline for verdicts.
Eckert said on the sidelines of an ethics in sport conference hosted by FIFA.
The ethics code also demands confidentiality, he said.
Eckert s comments will disappoint FIFA critics, who believed he could strip hosting rights.
Those would be decisions for FIFA s ruling executive committee -- which still includes 12 men who voted in the December 2010 polls -- or its congress of 209 federations, Eckert said.
We have a report from Mr.
Garcia but it is not of the legal quality of the final report.
It is a summary of what he has found out,  Eckert explained.  We are now doing a statement on the report and then Mr.
Those initial reports detailed  conclusions concerning further action with respect to certain individuals,  FIFA said in a statement this month.
No one at FIFA, including president Sepp Blatter, has read the confidential reports, the judge insisted.
Eckert said only four people have seen the files -- himself, Garcia, and their deputies, Australian judge Alan Sullivan and Swiss prosecutor Cornel Borbely.
Eckert said.
He dismissed reports that people under investigation had  applied pressure  on him to reveal details.
Eckert said, suggesting that would breach the FIFA code of ethics.
Garcia was due to speak in a conference session later Friday.
S.
Attorney and his investigators spent almost a year quizzing officials involved in the two-year bidding campaigns.
The contests were dogged by allegations of bribery, voting collusion, and seeking favours.
Some voting members of the FIFA board have since left football while under investigation in other corruption cases, and refused to cooperate.
Staffers from the nine candidates, involving 11 national associations, were also interviewed, and provided documents from their bids.
Eckert acknowledged the public scrutiny on his work.
I know.
I have the same pressure,  he said, referring to his full-time job in a state court in Munich.  I have to look where I have time to read and I will do it.
Very easy.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter talks during a news conference in March in Zurich.
Over the weekend, two stories broke involving alleged corruption and FIFA , the Swiss-based international organization that oversees soccer worldwide  including the World Cup .
Research I conducted  recently suggests that FIFA faces considerable obstacles to dealing with corruption, both on the field and within its ranks.
First, The New York Times reported that in the lead up to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, an Asian gambling syndicate compromised the South African Football Association.
The South African FA allegedly allowed referees who were working for the Singapore-based syndicate to officiate a number of international friendlies .
The referees allegedly “fixed” a number of matches, typically by awarding ghost penalties, running up the score to the benefit of gamblers in on the fix.
Second, in London, The Sunday Times published a trove of documents from a FIFA whistleblower detailing payments to FIFA officials made by a former FIFA executive in Qatar, allegedly to help Qatar win the vote to host the 2022 World Cup .
The Sunday Times’ revelations are the latest in a long series of similar stories surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cup votes  conducted simultaneously  dating to 2010, when The Sunday Times went undercover to reveal several members of FIFA’s executive committee trying to sell their votes for cash.
For FIFA, unfortunately, allegations of corruption and bribery are nothing new.
In 2011, FIFA embarked on a governance-reform effort to address an earlier round of accusations of corruption.
Last December, the organization declared the effort a success and closed it down.
And a 2012 report by FIFA’s governance-reform committee.
There are obviously some judgment calls here, but what I found does not lend itself to much optimism that FIFA has fixed its problems, and thus improved its ability to deal with corruption on and off the pitch.
Of the 59 total recommendations in the three reports, FIFA implemented only seven, partially implemented 10 and failed to implement 42.
There is some overlap across the reports, and a close look at reforms left undone reveals nine important areas where action has been recommended for FIFA to raise its governance standards to those expected in the international business community.
Although FIFA took some positive steps, such as creating a ethics committee with investigative powers, it avoided many steps that are basic to governance of organizations which turn over billions of dollars every year.
The reforms that it avoided implementing generally involved opening up the organization to independent oversight and management  such as might be found on a corporate board of directors  and increasing the organization’s transparency.
For example, FIFA stood firm that it would not release the compensation of its president, Sepp Blatter.
FIFA has an internal investigator — the one appointed as a result of the reform effort — looking into the allegations surrounding the Qatar 2022 vote.
He is supposed to  release his report soon after this year’s World Cup in Brazil.
History would tell us not to expect much.
For FIFA, the project of governance reform has a long way to go.
The good news for soccer fans and fans of good governance is that the pressure on FIFA to raise its game continues to mount.
At this point, the corruption and greed that runs through the top officials in FIFA is the status quo.
On Friday, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said they will not release the investigative report that supposedly uncovers corruption into the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup competitions.
Blatter and other top-ranking FIFA officials are simply ignoring any pressure to release the report.
Blatter is also running for another term, which he said he would not do, showing that he feels untouchable despite ruling through misconduct.
S.
Soccer President Sunil Gulati is among many that have publicly expressed support for the release of the report created by Michael J.
Garcia.
Despite public outcries, Blatter said there were no requests to release the report as part of media availability during FIFA meetings in Zurich.
Gulati was reached by phone by The New York Times and refused to comment after Blatter spat in the face of public opposition.
Those calling for the release of the report were not present during the World Cup bidding process, which is one of Blatter’s main argument points.
Hans-Joachim Eckert, who is in charge of FIFA’s independent ethics committee, has said that only the impressions of the report will be released.
Everyone in the global football community has a responsibility to act ethically.
Football fans rightly demand this.
FIFA has taken the lead.
Reports and proven findings of bribery, supplemented bank accounts, $27,000 watches and mischievous World Cup bidding are staples of Blatter’s tenure.
He has many of the smaller football federations in his pocket now and runs an organizations covered by Swiss Law to do business transactions to achieve its organizational goals.
If someone can get the report released, it may be the end of Blatter.
Right now, Blatter and FIFA can just ignore corruption claims knowing there isn’t enough opposition.
He will most likely be reelected and head the organization until 2019.
For those on the outside looking in, there is not much that can be done.
Ignoring corruption and wrongdoing as an operating tactic is expected from FIFA.
At this point, it will take something drastic for FIFA to change their ways.
For now, most of us just shake our heads and laugh.

June 9, 2014: FIFA , the global organizing body that oversees soccer and the World Cup , has unveiled a multi-level marketing campaign in time for the event, which begins on June 12.
The effort,  Elements,  comes with the umbrella theme,  Developing Football Everywhere,  and tackles such situations as discrimination, game manipulation and the role that the sport plays in uniting people and helping to enhance underdeveloped areas.
The campaign comes as FIFA s own global marketing partners and World Cup sponsors are releasing their own efforts to support the month-long event.
It also comes as many of FIFA s partners have openly questioned the selection of Qatar as host of the 2022 World Cup, a situation that has come under fire due to reports of bribes and other illegalities.
Elements  campaign  seeks to raise awareness about crucial issues in football.
FIFA is committed to developing football everywhere so that everyone can play and enjoy the same opportunities in the game.
The TV portion of the campaign is scheduled to be broadcast by FIFA s media rights licensees to global audiences during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which runs through July 13.
This huge platform gives FIFA an amazing opportunity to speak to a global audience,” Walter De Gregorio, director of communications and public affairs for FIFA, said in a statement.
The effort is anchored by three animated stop-action spots.
Support includes Internet and such social media destinations as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
Lead agency is London-based agency Klein & Sons.
A generic 30-second spot,   Seeds ,  shows a soccer ball buried in the ground, being watered and turing barren and desert lands into grassy, fertile areas on which soccer can be played and families can thrive.
Pitch Warfare   is tagged as an  anti-match manipulation  spot that  sends a powerful message that FIFA and its member associations are fighting match manipulation together.
It follows a soccer ball that having great difficulty getting to the net due to such obstacles as an inordinate number of yellow flags, chalk hands that swipe at the ball and a pitch the unexpectedly buckles like a giant wave and then goes flat but in an extremely high angle.
The situation reverts to normal only when flags of nations from around the world are introduced.
According to FIFA s De Gregorio, “We also felt it was crucial to let more people know about our work in football development, which is where so much of the proceeds from the FIFA World Cup go to.
Even as the campaign goes worldwide, global partners of FIFA have openly expressed concern about a report in the London Times that the bidding process and eventual selection of Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup involved brides, corruption and other unethical situations.
Among the companies that have voiced their trepidation over the situation include adidas , Coca-Cola, Hyundai-Kia, Sony and Visa.
Only FIFA global partner Emirates Airline has not as yet gone public with its opinion.
FIFA officials said the situation is being investigated and that a report from its ethics committee would be released in July.
The report most likely would be made public after the conclusion of the World Cup.
The World Cup kicks off on Thursday in Brazil, but all the talk is about the corrupt practices of the governing body for the sport of soccer  FIFA .
What was already known was revealed to be true: FIFA officials were bribed in the process of Qatar making a winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
The Middle Eastern country has also been beset by criticisms of human rights abuses towards the migrant workers building the stadiums.
In Brazil, police have been clearing out slums to prepare for this week’s event.
Protests dogged the Confederations Cup tournament, a sort of World Cup warm up played the year prior, and there is good reason to believe protests will begin again with the major event.
HBO comedian and television show host John Oliver summed up just how horrible FIFA has been while admitting that he is still excited about seeing the sport he loves.
Soccer is] an organized religion, and FIFA is its church.
Just think about it,” says Oliver.
It’s leader is infallible.
It compels South American countries to spend money they don’t have building opulent cathedrals.
And it may ultimately be responsible for the deaths of shocking numbers people in the Middle East.
If you need a catch up on all the terrible things that are associated with FIFA and the World Cup’s preparations in Brazil and Qatar, Oliver’s 13 minute description is a good start.

There s nothing bigger in global sports than the World Cup, and later this month, 2014 World Cup hysteria will kick off in Brazil.
In the soccer world, FIFA—the governing body of the sport—is something like a cross between the United Nations and the Kremlin.
Andrew Jennings, the  author of   Omertà: Sepp Blatter s FIFA Organised Crime Family ,  weighs in on the alleged plot to buy the 2022 World Cup.
Jennings.
It s not just The Sunday Times shedding light on potential FIFA corruption.
In addition to the allegations of bribery, an investigation by our partner The New York Times reveals an elaborate match-fixing scheme that took place during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
According to the report, referees were paid large sums of money to throw matches.
Jennings.
One match that Jennings says was fixed happened during the 2002 World Cup in South Korea.
As soon as the South Korean team went out of the contest, attendances would slump in the stadiums, so they had to keep them in until the final 16,  says Jennings.   beat Italy and Spain on match-official decisions just for economic grounds.
It wasn t for gamblers, it was just to keep the bottoms on the seats.
About 12 years ago Jennings started looking into FIFA as an investigative journalist—he found that the organization is highly secretive.
They don t publish anything—you can t find out what  FIFA President  Sepp Blatter earns, you d have to nail him to the floor and then he probably wouldn t tell you,  says Jennings.  I could smell organized crime.
I looked at the way it operated, and it s very simple—loyalty comes out from 209 national associations.
What you think, I think, and all listeners think is irrelevant as long as Blatter s got 209 national associations kissing his posterior.
S.
Jennings believes the allegations brought forth by The Sunday Times, saying that the decision to select Qatar as the site of the 2022 World Cup was likely motivated by bribes.
The report by The Sunday Times alleges that a former FIFA’s executive paid more than $5 million to other senior officials officials in exchange for support for Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.
Jennings believes there was likely more money spent.

FIFA banned senior Caribbean official Horace Burrell for six months on Friday for the Jamaican s part in a bribery case involving former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam, plunging the region s soccer authorities deeper into chaos.
FIFA banned senior Caribbean official Horace Burrell for six months on Friday for the Jamaican s part in a bribery case involving former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam, plunging the region s soccer authorities deeper into chaos.
Burrell, a long-time ally of former FIFA vice president Jack Warner and a member of FIFA s disciplinary committee, must now withdraw from the Caribbean Football Union presidential election scheduled for next month.
Since the bribery scandal broke in May, the CONCACAF continental body has seen its top three elected Caribbean officials - Warner, Burrell and Lisle Austin - either resign while under investigation or be banned by FIFA.
FIFA s ethics committee ruled three months of the Jamaican federation president s ban will be deferred for a probationary period of two years.
He said it will be up to the JFF to decide his future with the national body - whether to replace him temporarily for the length of the ban or permanently - but he still saw a future for himself within FIFA.
Burrell said.
Three other Caribbean officials also received bans.
Franka Pickering, president of the British Virgin Islands federation and one of the most senior women in world soccer, was suspended for 18 months.
FIFA issued 30-day bans to Osiris Guzman, president of the Dominican Republic soccer federation, and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines general secretary Ian Hypolite.
Fifteen days of their sanctions were deferred for six months.
The ethics panel met for three days this week to weigh evidence of CFU members allegedly accepting $40,000 cash payments from bin Hammam in May.
The Qatari official made a campaign visit to Trinidad, the home island of then-CFU leader Warner, to woo voters during his challenge to FIFA President Sepp Blatter.
Bin Hammam was banned for life by FIFA in July.
Burrell was favored to win a four-candidate poll in Jamaica on November 20 to succeed Warner as CFU leader.
Burrell s bid was ultimately ended by his own voters.
Former Jamaica Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who is president of his country s Premier League Clubs Association, said he regretted the sanctions against Burrell.
Seaga said.
Whistleblowers from four Caribbean countries sparked the probe by telling CONCACAF s American general secretary Chuck Blazer that brown envelopes stuffed with $100 bills were being offered in a Port of Spain hotel.
Blazer s alert to FIFA led the body to hire former FBI director Louis Freeh s investigation agency to interview Caribbean officials and gather evidence for the ethics panel.
FIFA s ethics panel reprimanded three other officials on Friday: St.
S.
Virgin Islands president Hillaren Frederick and Aubrey Liburd, vice president of the British Virgin Islands soccer body.
Five others received warnings, including FIFA committee members Yves Jean-Bart, the Haiti soccer president, and Richard Groden, Trinidad and Tobago s general secretary.
Former international referee Mark Bob Forde was also warned, along with his fellow Barbados official David Hinds and Burrell s federation general secretary Horace Reid.
FIFA said it dropped cases against David Fredericks of the Cayman Islands and Joseph Delves of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines because they had left the sport.
FIFA said in a statement.
FIFA did not give the officials the same  presumption of innocence  it accorded Warner in June when the 28-year executive committee veteran resigned rather than face sanctions.
FIFA banned Barbados official Austin for one year after he used a civil court in the Bahamas to pursue his bid, as interim president of CONCACAF, to fire Blazer in what was seen as act of revenge on Warner s behalf.
Also Friday, FIFA said a hearing into the case of Guyana official Noel Adonis was postponed and a case left open into the conduct of St.
Lucia official Patrick Mathurin.
FIFA cleared Felix Ledesma of the Dominican Republic of committing any violation.
After the scandal emerged, bin Hammam withdrew his election bid three days before the FIFA vote in June.
He denies bribery and is appealing his life ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Blatter ran unopposed and won a fourth four-year presidential term.
He was endorsed by 186 FIFA members, including most Caribbean islands.
FIFA s executive committee meets next week for the time since the election, and probably will do so without a Caribbean delegate because the process of replacing Warner was stalled by Austin s legal action.
Blatter is scheduled next Friday to provide the first details of his promised anti-corruption project to clean up world soccer and its damaged image.
However, the awarding of   World Cup 2022  to Qatar is the latest and most flagrant example.
FIFA, for the only time in its history, awarded two World Cups at the same time, Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022.
