A CHP Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle .
This is one of the many vehicle models replacing the discontinued Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor after 2013 in many American jurisdictions.
A police car is a ground vehicle used by police , to assist with their duties in patrolling and responding to incidents.
Typical uses of a police car include transportation for officers to reach the scene of an incident quickly, to transport suspects , or to patrol an area, while providing a high visibility deterrent to crime.
Some police cars are specially adapted for certain locations  e.
The first police car was a wagon run by electricity fielded on the streets of Akron, Ohio , in 1899.
The first operator of the police patrol wagon was Akron Police officer Louis Mueller, Sr.
The car was built by city mechanical engineer Frank Loomis.
The car s first assignment was to pick up a drunken man at the junction of Main and Exchange streets.
Terms for police cars include  police  cruiser, squad car, area car and patrol car.
In some places, a police car may also be informally known as a cop car, a black and white , a cherry top , a gumball machine, a jam sandwich or panda car .
Depending on the configuration of the emergency lights and livery, a police car may be considered a marked or unmarked unit.
In some areas of the world, the police car has become more widely used than police officers  walking the beat .
As such, these organizations often ask police departments to encourage officers to spend less time in their vehicles and more time walking the streets and interacting with the community.
This has led to some countries and forces, such as those in the United Kingdom , introducing more walking patrols, using either fully sworn Police Officers or Police Community Support Officers .
Decommissioned police cars are often sold to the general public, either through a police auction or a private seller, after about 3–5 years of use.
In all cases, the cars are stripped of their police markings as well as most internal equipment; however the engines are usually left intact, and are often larger engines than their civilian counterparts.
Hyundai Sonata patrol car in South Korea.
The car that replaces walking for the  beat  police officer .
Their primary function is to convey normal police officers between their duties  such as taking statements or visiting warnings .
A response car is similar to a patrol car, but is likely to be of a higher specification, capable of faster speeds, and will certainly be fitted with audible and visual warnings.
In the UK, each station usually only has one, which is called an area car .
Also known as Road Policing Units , these cars are designed for the job of enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road.
In some police forces, the term traffic car may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws.
As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones and flares, and traffic control signs.
Some police forces do not distinguish between patrol, response and traffic cars, and may use one vehicle to fulfill some or all roles even though in some cases this may not be appropriate  such as a police city vehicle in a motorway high speed pursuit chase .
An Australian  Dog Unit  car based on a pickup truck in New South Wales in January 2007.
This is a standard production car, visibly marked, but without audible and visual warning devices.
It is used by community police officers to show a presence, and to transport them between jobs.
However, not all unmarked police cars have government license plates.
This type of car is used to transport police dogs .
In some jurisdictions, this will be a station wagon or car based van, due to the installation of cages to carry the dogs.
These cars are typically marked in order to warn people that there is a police dog on board.
Some police forces use vehicles  or sometimes fake  cut outs  of vehicles  to deter crime.
They may be old vehicles retired from use, stock models restyled as police cars, or a metal sign made to look like a police car.
Such cars may also be used in conjunction with manned units hidden further down the road to trick speeders into speeding back up again, and being clocked by the manned car.
The car is taken to a place where it is known to be at risk of theft, and allowed to be stolen.
The police then track the vehicle, and can disable the engine and lock the doors by remote control.
In some jurisdictions, the police may operate a rescue service, and special units will be required for this.
In jurisdictions where the police are responsible for, or participate in, explosive ordnance disposal squads  bomb squads , dedicated vehicles transport the squads  crews and equipment.
The police car on the left is fitted with a lightbar, making it instantly recognizable as a police vehicle.
Police cars are usually passenger car models which are upgraded to the specifications required by the purchasing force.
Several vehicle manufacturers, such as Ford , General Motors and Dodge , provide a  police package  option, which is built to police specifications in the factory.
Modifications a police car might undergo include adjustments for higher durability, speed, high mileage driving and long periods of idling at a higher temperature.
This is usually accomplished by heavy duty suspension , brakes , calibrated speedometer , tires , alternator , transmission and cooling systems , and also sometimes includes slight modifications to the car s stock engine or the installation of a more powerful engine than would be standard in that model.
It is also usual to upgrade the capacity of the electrical system of the car to accommodate the use of additional electronic equipment.
In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws  such as the right to exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a yield sign  and may also suggest a duty on other motorists to move out of the direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution.
Visual warnings on a police car can be of two types: either passive or active.
Modern police vehicles in some countries have retroreflective markings which reflect light for better visibility at night.
Other police vehicles may only have painted on or non-reflective markings.
Most marked police vehicles in the United Kingdom and Sweden have reflective Battenburg markings on the sides, which are large blue and yellow rectangles.
Another passive visual warning of police vehicles is simply the interceptor s silhouette.
This is easily observed in the United States, where the ubiquitous nature of the Ford Crown Victoria in police fleets has made the model synonymous with police vehicles.
Police vehicle marking schemes usually include the word Police or similar phrase  such as State Trooper or Highway Patrol  or the force s crest.
Some police forces use unmarked vehicles, which do not have any passive visual warnings at all, and others  called stealth cars  have markings that are visible only at certain angles, such as from the rear or sides, making these cars appear unmarked when viewed from the front.
These flash in order to attract the attention of other road users as the police car approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped vehicle in a dangerous position on the road.
Common colours for police warning beacons are blue and red, however this often varies by force.
Some police forces also use arrow sticks to direct traffic, or message display boards to provide short messages or instructions to motorists.
In addition to visual warnings, most police cars are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens , which can alert people and vehicles to the presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen.
The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the car.
A development is the use of the RDS system of car radios , whereby the vehicle can be fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, in the manner of a traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message  as with traffic broadcasts .
A new technology has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police.
Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler.
One of the most important pieces of equipment in modern law enforcement, and strongly linked with the development of the police car.
In certain countries, including the United States, some police vehicles are equipped with lockers or locking racks in which to store firearms.
Police vehicles can be fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside or outside the car.
Some police cars are fitted with devices to measure the speed of vehicles being followed, such as ProViDa , usually through a system of following the vehicle between two points a set distance apart.
The Pursuit Intervention Technique  PIT  bumper attaches to the front frame of a patrol car.
Fitted to the chassis of the car and located to augment the front bumper, to allow the car to be used as a battering ram for simple structures or fences, or to push disabled vehicles off the road.
The installation of this equipment in a car partially transforms it into a desk.
Police officers use their car to fill out different forms, print documents, type on a computer or a console, consult and read different screens, etc.
Ergonomics in layout and installation of these items in the police car plays an important role in the comfort and safety of the police officers at work and preventing injuries such as back pain and musculoskeletal disorders.
In film and television fiction, police cars are usually portrayed as containing a team of two police officers so that they may converse and interact on screen.
In reality, most districts  especially rural and low population  have only one police officer per vehicle, although at night this may increase to two.

Welcome to the National Police Car Archives!
Our simple goal at the National Police Car Archives is to present law enforcement vehicles from every single agency in the United States of America.
A Ford Crown Victoria of the Los Angeles Police Department is seen here responding from the Hollywood Police Station.
The exit used by the police cars is also used by the two ambulances of the LAFD, Rescue 27 and Rescue 827 which are housed at the LAFD Firehouse 27 just next to the police station.
Compared to the average model, police cars drink a lot of gas, idle for hours on end and generally take more abuse than any other vehicle on the road.
So do you still want to even think about buying a Police Interceptor in Ford , Chevy or Dodge form?
Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptors.
There is also a pecking order when it comes to Police Interceptors.
Police cars that are used in the line of duty typically have a cloth front-seat, vinyl back-seat combination and you will see wires and holes wherever there was police equipment.
Most public buyers prefer all black police cars and, as a long-time car dealer, I find that these black beauties are usually far easier to retail.
A step up from both of them is the Police Interceptor that has a cloth interior and none of the hanging wires or gaping holes of the active duty models .
These vehicles tend to be abused far less and are used by government employees or, in certain cases, police officials that don t engage in high-speed pursuits.
I was the only bidder of this supposedly inoperable car which, according to the online listing, showed well over 200,000 miles on the odometer.
I brought a jump box to where the vehicle was located and, miracle of miracles, the car started right up.
Of course, there are some busts in the ex-police car game.
Ford Crown Vics in particular have become the  almost car  when it comes retailing used cars.
It s the car that everyone says they  kinda  want, but never buy.
A full-sized, gas-guzzling V8, with rear-wheel drive, and more cheap plastic bits than the off-brand Lego store usually doesn t translate into a highly sought-after used car.
Throw in exposed wires from all the police-only parts that were removed, couple that with well worn seats, and you wind up with a car that is sometimes bought for as little as 10 percent of its original purchase price after seven years.
Most of these Police Interceptors would sell right around the $1,000 mark with maybe a few going upwards of $1,500 to $1,800.
So if you want a cop car, take your time,  and please, try to avoid locking yourself in the back seat .
Police apprehend 15 year old who stole a squad car Suspect steals HPD car, leads police on chase Check out this story on KHOU.
A suspect stole a police cruiser and led police on a 20-minute chase through northwest Houston Friday night.
HOUSTON – A 15-year-old suspect is in custody tonight after stealing a Houston police car and leading police on a chase through northwest Houston.
Police say the boy stole a police cruiser while an officer was assisting a victim out of another after an accident near Fairbanks North Houston and proceeded to lead police on a 20-minute chase.
The chase ended when the suspect lost control and crashed the squad car on West Little York near Deep Forest.
The boy attempted to flee on foot, police said, but was quickly apprehended.
Police haven t determined why the boy stole the squad car.
Here in America, we’re all well-aware that police departments are constantly upgrading their hardware, getting the newest, biggest and baddest technology available.
While most police cruisers stick to classic models like the Crown Victoria or Ford Taurus, some departments around the world look to be gearing up for a street race rather than fighting crime.
Well, that behavior is all too common in cities like Dubai, and as a result, police departments have stacked their arsenal to combat it.
Here are the ten fastest police cars in the world, specially-created to serve the needs of the boys in blue in specific areas all over the world.
One thing is for sure: the police aren’t cutting any corners in their battle to keep dangerous driving at bay.
Read on to see the world’s ten fastest police cars.
Used in northern England by the Humberside Police, this 416 horsepower beast is mostly used as a deterrent, but is also used to run down criminals and speeders in super high-speed sports cars.
In what is probably the most unique police car in the world, authorities in the UK are the proud safekeepers of a specially-outfitted Ariel Atom, which can hit a top speed of 168 miles per hour, and get to 60 miles per hour in just 2.
The Atom actually ties with one other model on the list for the quickest police car in the world, and probably sends an incredible message to speeders with its Formula 1 styling.
It’s hard to think there’s a cooler police car out there, but as you’ll see, other countries have mounted quite a supercar cache to deter lawbreakers.
While the standard version is pictured above, the police have the province of Flevoland welcomed the C8 Spyder to the force in 2008.
Now armed with a car that can hit 186 miles per hour and soar to 60 mph in just 4.
Spyker is a Dutch-based car maker, so it’s fitting to keep one of their impressive supercars right at home.
German police are the proud owners of an Audi  VLKAY.
German company ABT Sportsline outfitted the R8 GTR specifically for the police department, and even suped-up the 5.
The car, however, has not been put on patrol or used to deter crime.
It is used only for show, but still makes an attractive component to the police’s armory.
V10 engine to produce 560 horsepower, giving some bite to the Italian police’s road presence.
You’ll learn one thing very quickly while reading through this list: don’t mess with the Dubai Police Department.
It was added to the Dubai PD’s fleet in the spring of 2013, and adds even more teeth to the police’s supercar supply.
If you had to guess as to what city’s police department adopted a Lambroghini Aventador LP 700-4, who would it be?
The car itself is aptly-named, as only 77 were built, and now one has been modified into a crime-fighting machine.
With all the money flying around Dubai, the police decided to up the ante with a few supercars of their own to combat the wild driving habits of the super wealthy.
The Brabus Rocket is a suped-up Mercedes model, that can keep up with almost any other car out there.
German police felt the need to add one to their fleet, so the 6.
V12 powered car is now outfitted for the boys in blue.
The Dubai Police decided that what they already had in stock just wasn’t enough, so they decided to go and get themselves the second-fastest car in the world, the Bugatti Veyron.
The Dubai police apparently need a car that can chase down anything else on the road, as the Veyron is, of course, the official world record holder for fastest car in the world.
It only set the police department back a cool $1.
A Pennsylvania woman tried to steal an unmarked police car — with two officers sitting inside it.
Pittsburgh resident Ria Buford thought she found herself a new ride Saturday morning when she saw a man get out of the driver’s seat of an idling car in front of Club Xtaza, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports.
The 32-year-old was surprised to find Officer Garrett Spory and another cop sitting inside the parked car, staking out a nearby afterparty following a Wiz Khalifa concert.
Spory quickly tried to push the woman out of the car.
Pittsburgh police, get out of the vehicle now!
Trying to think of the best excuse she could, Buford told the officers she was only taking the unmarked cop car to drive to her own vehicle, the Post Gazette reports.
When Buford refused to get out, Spory made his way to the driver’s side and tried to yank the idiotic car thief from the seat.
SAN DIEGO  CNS CBS 8  - A 22-year-old woman who led officers on a chase from downtown San Diego to Oceanside in a stolen police cruiser is in custody Saturday on suspicion of multiple felony charges.
Felicitas Flores is accused of stealing the parked police cruiser about 11:30 p.
The chase was led by a San Diego police cruiser driven by Flores, believed to be under the influence.
We got a report from one of our officers in the downtown area that their police car was missing.
We were able to locate that car going northbound I-5, just past Genesee,” San Diego police Lt.
Driving on just the car s rims, Flores finally pulled into a Oceanside rest stop.
While the driver was doing that she intentionally rammed three police vehicles, two CHP vehicles and one San Diego vehicle,” Lt.
As for how the car was stolen -- that s still under investigation.
Saturday on suspicion of felony grand theft auto, evading police, three counts of assault with a deadly weapon that is not a firearm on a peace officer, and other felony and misdemeanor charges, according to information from the San Diego County Sheriff s Department website.

Police from multiple jurisdictions have joined the search for a 30-year-old man who police say stole a police cruiser from midtown Kansas City, abandoned it about an hour north of the city, near Pattonsburg, Mo.
Although police are not confirming they are the same person, FOX 4 has learned there is a Joshua William Boyd in the legal system, also born April 1984, who is listed as a non-compliant sex offender.
The last picture is the man, also named Joshua Boyd, who police say stole a police car and a shotgun.
One of the officers called an ambulance for Boyd, but upon arrival, police said Boyd claimed the ambulance wasn’t real, then jumped into the driver side of one of the patrol cars, a Ford Taurus, No.
One of the officers attempted to stop him by holding the car in park and removing the keys from the ignition, but Boyd was able to get the vehicle into drive.
For about two hours, police talked to the man over the two-way radio and tried to negotiate with him to surrender.
When they lost communication with the two-way radio, police tracked the phone and car to the area they ended up searching Wednesday evening.
The police car was located at the 75 mile marker near I-35, about ten miles south of Bethany, Mo.
Inside the vehicle, police said they located a wallet with a jail wristband of Joshua W.
An employee of the Shell Station, where the chase began, was able to positively identify Boyd as the man who allegedly stole the police cruiser, from a lineup of six white males.
Court documents state that Boyd’s father, Joel Boyd, said his son had contacted him to tell him he was upset the police car he was driving could’t go faster than 130 mph.
Joel Boyd said the phone call disconnected, but his son immediately called back and told him he was driving a police car with a police issued shotgun in his lap.

Ford : SUV becomes USA s top police car Between the Explorer SUV and Taurus sedan, Ford says it has almost half the police market Check out this story on USATODAY.
Ford has already claimed that the police verson of the Explorer SUV has become America s new most popular cop car.
Ford sold 14,086 Interceptor SUVs last year, as the police version of the Explorer is known, up 140% from the year before.
At the same time, it sold 10,897 Taurus outfitted for police work, up 31% from 2012.
Together, they account for almost half of all police vehicles sold among the major brands -- Dodge, Ford and Chevrolet, according to Ford, which bases its analysis on data from industry statisticians R.
Taurus competes in the police sedan market against Dodge Charger and Chevrolet  Caprice.
All are trying to fill the gap left by Ford s decision to kill the venerable Crown Victoria sedan, the mainstay of America s police agencies for years.
The new utility vehicle body is suited to the changing role of police officers, who need to carry more equipment to be ready for any contingency.
There is lots of information on engines for 1967-72 and 1976 squads, and a fleet-car forum .
How good were the Mopar police cars?
The 1969 Polara was the fastest police car ever tested by the CHP, until beaten by the Camaro in the 1990s, 25 years later.
From 1958 until the 1980s, the only times a brand other than Dodge was selected as the primary car were in 1962, when the CHP bought Chrysler Enforcers; 1967, with Oldsmobile; and 1970, with Mercury.
But the police have met this arms race with their own supercars, making it the world’s fastest road-going police force.
We’ve detailed more than a few of these over the years, and while Italy s state police certainly make a good argument  or is it a bad one ?
Dubai’s variety and quantity dwarf any other police force’s array of hot hoon-harvesting hardware.
Victor White III, had been arrested and died while in police custody.
But he didn’t receive the news from the New Iberia Sheriff s Department—he got the call from his son Leonard, who also lives in New Iberia and had been questioned that morning by police in connection with the death of his brother.
But the cops refused to tell him anything about the circumstances surrounding his 22-year-old son’s death, citing an ongoing investigation by the state police.
It wasn’t until I got back and looked on the state police s Facebook page that I found out what had happened to my son.
The sheriff s deputies who arrested Victor III allege that when they arrived at the Iberia Parish Sheriff s Office, Victor III wouldn t leave the car and became “uncooperative.
I called the state police and the local sheriff s office to ask questions about whether Victor s last moments were caught on video, who the officers in question are, and how a suspect in police custody could have had a gun after being frisked, but no one would comment anything of substance since the shooting was being investigated.
This is standard operating procedure at police departments.
We don t buy the police’s story.
To those close to Victor III, the claim that he would try pull out a gun and shoot himself while in the custody of police is just absurd.
Local police officials, however, would not elaborate for me on Victor White III’s criminal record, once again citing the ongoing investigation.
Severely skeptical of the state investigation and the local police, Victor Sr.
Simply put, they re tired of waiting to hear from the police.
UPDATE: According to the White family s lawyer, Carol Powell Lexing, there is video footage that confirms Victor III was not involved in the fight outside the New Iberian convenient store, which caused the police to arrive on the scene and stop and question him.
Cobb County police arrested a woman after they say she stole one of their police cars and led officers on a chase down Interstate 75.
At some point during the stop, the woman, identified as Emmerli Wilcoxson, managed to get into the police car and take off.
We saw two police cars coming.
Police say Wilcoxson was driving the car at speeds of more than 100 mph southbound on the interstate.
As Wilcoxson approached the North Avenue exit of I-75 85 southbound, police say she ran the car into the back of a Chevy Cavalier, sending them both into the wall.
Police say the driver of the Cavalier, Greg Titus, suffered severe injuries to his lower body and had to be extracted from the car.
Police say Wilcoxson got out of her car after the crash and charged at officers before she was subdued.
Several lanes of I-75 85 southbound were closed as police investigated the incident.
They alleged that White III shot himself—in the backseat of a police car, while his hands were cuffed behind his back, with a gun that mysteriously appeared after they had searched and arrested him.
Other than those basic details, it s been radio silence for months in terms of official information from the local authorities, who ve cited an ongoing investigation into the shooting by the state police as their reason for not sharing any more details or answering any questions about Victor White III.
I know—I ve reached out to everyone from the local to state police, not to mention political officials like New Iberia s Mayor Hilda Curry, only to fall on deaf ears or get the line about an on-going investigation.
First off, the cause of death according to the report was a suicide, which is drastically different from the seemingly accidental shooting initially described by police officials.
And even if he did, the back seat of a cop car at one in the morning is a strange place to decide to snuff it.
So in order for him to have shot himself in the chest, he would have had to pull himself through his cuffed arms in the backseat of that cop car—and of course, have a gun in the first place.
He was never alerted by officials that his son had been arrested and died in police custody in the first place.
New Iberia, at first the police refused to even let him see his son s body.
The police wouldn t even reveal to him how they thought that his son died.
He ended up finding out that the police were claiming his son shot himself in the back by way of a public Facebook post published by the department.
And how do the police reconcile this report with their initial account?
An unarmed teenager named Michael Brown was shot six times—once in the head—and  killed by his local police  in Ferguson, Missouri.
A Louisiana community is asking questions nearly a month after police said that a young man fatally shot himself in the back in the back of a patrol car.
As the state police continue their investigation, though, the man s family is anxious for an answer.
Victor White III, 22, was apprehended by police in Iberia Parish   on the night of Sunday March 2 because of their suspicion that he   was involved in a fight nearby.
Trooper Stephen Hammons told the Baton Rouge Advocate that deputies who   searched White claimed to find illegal drugs on his person, at   which point they handcuffed him and drove to the police station   for processing.
Harmons told local media   outlets that White was uncooperative when it came time to enter   the police car, was able to produce a weapon with his hands   cuffed behind his back, and fired a single shot into his own   back.
Sheriff Louis Ackal called on state police to launch an   investigation into the matter, meaning the authorities are not   permitted to comment publicly until the investigation is   completed.
We expect the state police to drag their investigation on   for about nine or 10 months â€“ until they think the outrage about   what happened to Victor White has died down â€“ and then come back   and pass the buck to another law enforcement agency or say they   havenâ€™t found any evidence of wrongdoing,â€� he told the Louisiana Weekly .
We donâ€™t expect the   state police to do anything â€“ we have no confidence in them at   all.
Vice reported that, while the police were mostly quiet regarding   the case, a Lieutenant Anthony Green would have disagreed with   the Reverendâ€™s assertion saying, â€œThe community is not really   up in arms about this.
Margie Broussard, president of the Lafayette Branch of   the NAACP, told the Advocate that the police may not have   murdered White, but their descriptions of what happened were   â€œfar-fetched.
Two Philadelphia police cruisers were damaged Monday morning in a crash in Center City.
According to police, a bicyclist was hit at the intersection earlier in the morning.
While the officer was interviewing the driver and that bicyclist on the sidewalk, police got another call that a child was unresponsive in the area and not breathing.
That s when a 17th district officer, according to police, turned on her lights, came speeding down Spruce Street and collided with a pickup truck.
The impact spun her vehicle into the parked police cruiser at the corner of the intersection.

My least-fond memory of those hazy years involved a brother who drove a retired police cruiser.
While his typical days were spent terrorizing other motorists by suddenly appearing in their rearview mirrors, one day he decided to lead the campus police on a high-speed chase  as one does .
He got ahead of them, hid his car and ran into the fraternity house, breathlessly telling me he d been there the whole time.
The police arrived, having ran his plates and asking for him by his last name.
Shockingly, neither he nor I were arrested that day  keep in mind, these were just campus police , but I ve since become a firm believer that unless you want to start a second life as a taxi driver, you should not buy a used police car.
Autos has put together a smartly comprehensive buying guide , written by a dealer, that details the ins and outs of the police car buying process.
Victor White III died in a Louisiana hospital, the victim of a gunshot that police said White fired after being frisked twice, handcuffed and placed in the back of a New Iberia police cruiser.
The Louisiana State Police wrapped up their investigation into the shooting last week.
In a press conference last week, Crump said White’s death is reminiscent of 21-year-old Chavis Carter’s 2012 death in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Jesus Huerta’s 2013 death in Durham, North Carolina, both of whom allegedly shot themselves while handcuffed in police cars.
We have a terrible recent trend that is occurring across states lines … that finds these Houdini handcuff suicides while they’re in the custody of police that defies all logic, all common sense,” Crump said.
Ryan Turner said Sheriff Louis Ackal “immediately after the incident contacted the state police to show fairness and impartiality in the investigation.
Doug Cain, state police spokesman, granted an interview but declined to discuss specifics of the case until the district attorney makes them public.
About six blocks from the store, an Iberia Parish deputy responding to the fight saw White and Lewis walking and stopped them, according to a state police news release.
White’s cooperation apparently dissipated en route to the station, according to the state police news release.
Once at the station, he refused to exit the patrol car.
Though the news release issued by state police provides scant details of White’s arrest and subsequent death, White Sr.
The initial report that White was shot in the back rather than the chest has gotten some unfair media coverage, Cain of the Louisiana State Police said.
The report, which noted White had alcohol and marijuana in his system, contains other findings that Powell-Lexing said were notable: There were “abrasions” around White’s left eye, White reportedly said something to the effect of “he was gone” before being placed in the police car and there was no “stippling,” or unburned gunpowder, around the bullet wound.
The sheriff’s office referred him to state police.
State police referred him to the sheriff’s office.
Once there, he received calls from friends and family members stunned by a news release posted on the Louisiana State Police website.

Australia, who has its own cool police cruiser in the Holden Commodore-based HSV GTS, has just received a brand-new toy in the form of a Porsche 911 Carrera.
Provided by the company’s Australian arm as part of a partnership with the New South Wales Police Force, the German sports car won’t be used for highway duties, as its performance numbers might indicate.
Instead, it will be used to raise awareness among younger drivers and as a show car during various events.

But it’s only now that we get to see them all together all while talking to the police officers who carry the privilege of driving these exotics on a daily basis.

Well, in Nevada and plenty of other states, there is a lot of this happening, and the police are raking in the dough because of it.
Dove then searched Nguyen’s car and Nguyen opened a briefcase for the deputy, exposing the $50,000 he was carrying.
Dove then claimed to smell marijuana in the car and made Nguyen sign a  property for safekeeping receipt,  which basically says  here, take my stuff without any criminal charges, because he thought the money was illegally obtained.
Nguyen claims he only signed the form under the threat that Dove would confiscate his car and leave him stranded if he hadn’t.
What makes this all a little fishier is the fact that the Police keep 100 percent of the proceeds from the forfeiture.
Don’t go thinking that this can only happen in Nevada either, as 25 states allow police to keep all the forfeited and seized money, and 37 states have a  guilty until you prove your innocence  stance on forfeitures.
Check out the video after the jump to see some of the crazy things the police have bought with forfeited money.
Commenters — obviously folks from Dubai — also pointed out that the image that circulated the web was simply a suggestion to the Dubai Police force and not a claim that the model actually existed.
And to prove its realness, the Dubai Police released a video highlighting the model all done up in the signature green and white livery.

Here’s the ultimate battle of Police supercars worldwide.
The Porsche 911 Carrera S has been extensively modified by TechArt for its role as a police car.
Lamborghini donated one of these beauties to the Italian Police back in 2004.
Not quite a supercar, but I bet chases on the narrow streets of Rome are much more interesting since the Italian Police got this.
The Exige is a lightweight, high performance car that accelerates from 0 to 60 faster than typical V8 cars and yet only uses around 5 liters   100 km.
The nearly $200,000 car was loaned to the authorities by a local Lamborghini importer to use it as an “attention-getting device” to control traffic.

In my opinion, the only car that you would ever see a lot on the streets, if at all, would be Australia’s Holden VE Commodore.
That Police Corvette is not a c5 it’s a c6, note the rims and the inset doorhandles.
The UK spec Gallardo is very much wearing normal police uniform for this country.
The base colour is yellow on the Gallardo, and most police cars seem to have white, but the high-visibility blue and yellow checks are the norm these days.
You might notice that the real nastiness is only on the sides of the car, and this appears to be intentional, as all UK police cars  apart from that exige  only have the real bright reflective colours on the sides.
This is clearly so that you stand less of a chance of noticing the car behind you is a police car!
It rains in the UK on over 50% of the time, and that livery pattern is essentially invisible when the roads are wet as spray from the wheels obscures the sides of the car, when looking from the front.

The Bugatti Veyron , once the most expensive, fastest car in the world, is dolled up like a patrol car in Dubai.
I know you re thinking this is a fake, because the last time a white Bugatti in Dubai police livery made the rounds online, it wasn t real .
This time the car is very much real, from the official Dubai Police Facebook page , to this video of the car driving along after its official unveiling.
Like the other Dubai police cars, this Veyron will just serve as something like a permanent parade car, a rolling billboard to the UAE s wealth.
If you re wondering what else is in the Dubai ornamental police fleet, here s our complete guide .

KOIN 6  — A police chase and crash has closed SE Division closed between 79th Ave.
Troy Lynn Harrison, 28, was arrested after crashing into a police cruiser and a nearby home in a stolen vehicle, the Portland Police Bureau said.
At roughly 5:40 Sunday, a Portland Police Bureau officer attempted to stop a stolen car in the parking lot of the Portland Community College campus at SE 82nd Ave.
However, the driver, later identified as Harrison, sped away and crashed into a responding officer’s car on SE Division at 80th Ave.
That police cruiser then hit and damaged a light pole, police said.
The driver, a sergeant with the Portland Police Bureau’s East Precinct, was treated at the scene for non-life threatening injuries and transported to a nearby hospital.
After the driver was arrested, several officers, including a police K-9, searched for the passenger, who had been dropped off prior to the attempted traffic stop That passenger was not located.
About $300 worth of candy that North Vernon Police officers planned to hand out during trick or treat hours Friday was stolen from an unmarked North Vernon police car parked at Cracker Barrel in Seymour.
Randall Marshall with North Vernon Police Department.
Police said two windows were broken out of the police car between 12:50 and 1:25 p.
A police badge and ID, a fingerprint kit and a camouflage backpack were also taken from the vehicle.
The small town police department spent another $300 to replace the stolen candy.
North Vernon police officers are warning people in the area about a potential police impersonator.
After hearing about the stolen candy, one woman dropped off two bags to the North Vernon Police Department Thursday afternoon.
Sioux City Police Car s Windshield Struck By Wheel of Pursued Vehicle.
Mark Kirkpatrick confirms that one of the wheels came off of Hughes  vehicle and struck a Sioux City Police Vehicle in the windshield.

Hughes then got out on foot and ran into a corn field North of Sioux City, where he was apprehended with the help of a police canine unit.
Forensic evidence shows Michael Brown’s blood on the gun, on the uniform and inside the car of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, law enforcement officials said, information they believe potentially corroborates the officer’s story that the unarmed 18-year-old tried to take his gun.
Louis County police, the FBI and a county grand jury are investigating the shooting.
Activists march in the streets in Missouri to protest police brutality two months after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.
Officials who spoke to The Washington Post on Saturday said the forensic evidence supports Wilson’s account that a scuffle occurred at the police vehicle, that Wilson feared for his life and that Brown went for, or lunged for, his gun.
No matter what happened in the car, Michael Brown ran away from him.
From the earliest days police have said that Brown scuffled with Wilson and that a shot was fired in the vehicle.
In those first police accounts, St.
Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that Brown “allegedly pushed” Wilson back into the car after Wilson tried to open the door.
Brown, police said, then “physically assaulted” Wilson and went for the gun.
Wilson drove past, then backed up and opened the car door so forcefully that it bounced against the two men.
Wilson, still in the car, then grabbed Brown by his collar.
Several other witnesses recounted activity at the car, but each said they were unclear about the nature of that encounter.
Protests were explosive after the shooting, when demonstrators squared off against police who used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse crowds.
Images of police patrolling the streets during the day and clashing with demonstrators at night shocked many and drew concern from the White House and some Washington lawmakers.

Abandon your dreams of setting a land speed record on the second longest straightaway in the world , Porsche has just bestowed Australian police in New South Wales with a 911 Carrera.
Although the 911 might make an ideal Police response car in some people s eyes, the true value of the sporty Carrera in police decals is that it will draw attention and curiosity with younger folk especially which is exactly what we aim to achieve,  said Police Superintendent Sicard, undoubtedly disappointed he won t get a chance to open it up on the Eyre Highway or the gut-twisting curves of the Blue Mountains.
Porsche is maintaining ownership of the car; the cops are just allowed to dress it up and drive it around as long as they keep it out of harm s way.
At least the New South Wales police are only on the hook for  fuel and tollway costs.

Dubai police just acquired a very expensive tool for law enforcement: A $1.
The Bugatti is the latest addition to the Dubai police force’s “super fleet” of luxury and high-end sports cars, according to global news site Vocativ .
But if you’re hoping to see how it performs in a police chase, don’t get your hopes up.
The car is just the latest weapon in a Dubai police public relations campaign.
Dubai police are using their impressive fleet as a means of building connections between citizens and tourists.
Described by Vocativ as one of the most progressive Arab police forces, officers like to show off their fancy wheels in some of the most luxurious parts of Dubai, including shopping malls, the beach, and luxurious hotels.
But in this car, you feel different.
In addition to the Veyron, Dubai police also have in their fleet an Aston Martin 177, an Audi R8, a Nissan GTR, a Ferrari FF, and a Ford Mustang.
Meanwhile, a police force across the pond is getting a major tune-up.
The Somerset Constabulary has partnered with performance sports car manufacturer Ariel Motors to equip an Atom 3.
R with “the necessary police gear,” according to AutoWeek .
This includes blue LED strobes in the car’s nose cone, a siren system, and high-visibility reflective vinyl wrap.
The car can go from 0 to 62 miles per hour in 2.
Like the Dubai police fleet, the Somerset Constabulary car is also public relations tool.

The report, released six months after Victor White III s death, contradicts the statements initially released by police.
A coroner’s report obtained exclusively by NBC News claims that a 22-year-old Black man committed suicide while handcuffed behind his back in the back seat of a police car on March 3.
Yet, according to an initial statement from the Louisiana State Police, Victor White III had shot himself in the back.
In addition to his wound, abrasions were also reportedly discovered on his face that were not there when police first stopped him.
The police stopped both White and Lewis on their way back from the station, patted them down and located “suspected marijuana” in his pants, according to the report.
The police then ran White and Lewis’ names through a police database and called for backup.
White had been handcuffed behind his back and put in the back seat of the cruiser by the time a second police car arrived.
Lewis, who was dismissed, walked back to his father’s house, but White was transported to the Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office where he “became uncooperative” “produced a handgun” and “fired one round, striking himself,” according to police.
Dash camera footage and the names of the officers present during White’s death have not been released by the State Police yet due to the pending investigation.
Police cars are emergency service vehicles used by police .
The cars begin to chase the protagonist of each Grand Theft Auto game when they have received either a police head or wanted star .
Police cars are known by different names in different games, whilst GTA IV has two models of police cars: The Police Cruiser and Police Patrol .
Since GTA III, the majority of police cars in the game have shared the same body design as the Taxi .
Other police and law enforcement vehicles exist.
These include the Enforcer police SWAT van, the Police Maverick helicopter, HPV-1000 and VCPD Wintergreen police bikes and the Predator police boat.
Oddly, the Vice City Stories Police Predator won t respond if your in a boat until you achieve a 4 star wanted level.
In Grand Theft Auto 1 , the police car is known as the  Squad Car .
Three variants of the car exist, each appearing in one of the game s three cities.
In Liberty City , the Squad Car is rounded vehicle with blue-white livery, appearing similar to a 1990 s Chevrolet Caprice; the San Andreas   Vice City variants are actually adaptations of the Portsmouth , with the San Andreas version bearing a black-and-white body color design and similar angular body design, and the Vice City rendition being colored blue and white but features a modified body that appears wider and rounded.
In the PC version of GTA 1, the police cars  along with the Ambulance and the Fire Truck   will have their radio tuned to Brooklyn Underground FM , unlike all other renditions throughout the series which only have the standard police dispatch radio.
In Grand Theft Auto 2 , the police car is known as the  Cop Car  and assumes a completely original design, looking like a retro-futuristic squad car with 1940s design cues.
Like in GTA 1, it is the fastest car in the game, along with the Meteor , and features responsive cornering and brakes, making it a desirable vehicle to drive.
It is also the only car in the game which gives a Cop Bribe when crushed .
The police car in GTA2 was originally green-and-white, along with the SWAT Van , but this combination is never seen in the game, it was changed to a blue-and-white combination.
Ray Larabie  s original design for GTA 2 s  Cop Car .
A Vice City Squad Car with an officer beside it.
In all the games of this era, the police car has been known as the  Police , with the exception of GTA Advance and GTA Vice City Stories.
In GTA Advance, it is referred to as the  Police Car , and in GTA Vice City Stories, it is called the  VCPD Cruiser .
Throughout all 3D era games, police cars are very fast, with excellent handling, and moderate durability.
The player will receive 5 rounds of ammunition for any weapon in the Shotgun slot after entering a Police car.
The Police Car in these two games resembles a cross between a Chevrolet Caprice and a Ford Crown Victoria.
In GTA III , the Police Car was originally intended to have a blue-and-white stripes livery similar to the 1990s early 2000s NYPD police cars, however, in the final version, they have standard black and white livery like the Los Angeles Police Department.
Also, the original Police Car had a more sleek profile compared to the final which appears more angular boxy  though hints of the aerodynamic design do remain .
The Police Cars in GTA Liberty City Stories feature the stripes livery intended for GTA III cars, albeit in black-and-white rather than blue-and-white.
Early pre-release depiction of GTA III s police car, featuring a lower profile and the 1990s early 2000s NYPD color scheme.
In these two games, the vehicle resembles a 1980 s Ford LTD, and both feature a green and white livery, much like the Miami-Dade Police Department.
During development, the vehicle was white with red and blue stripes along each side, resembling squad cars from the Miami Beach Police Department.
Despite the fact that the Police in Vice City has AWD, it lacks the stability of other fast AWD vehicles in the game  namely the Deluxo and Comet  .
As such, the Police is prone to roll over or spin at a moments notice, so it may be best to avoid drastic and abrupt maneuvers while driving it.
The same car was reused in Rockstar s Manhunt games.
The main difference is that the car has a black and white paintjob instead of a green and white paintjob.
Early pre-release depiction of GTA Vice City s police car, featuring a livery more alike to that of the Miami Beach Police Department.
The Los Santos Police Department and San Fierro Police Department versions have the same build, based on the Premier , with the San Fierro version having slightly higher suspension most likely due to San Fierro s hilly streets with steep inclines  like its real life counterpart, San Francisco , and markings for their respective cities.
The Las Venturas Police Department version generally resembles a 1981-1990 Chevrolet Caprice, with the sides and back reminiscent of the 1980-1989 Dodge Diplomat, and the closest civilian car in the game is the Tahoma .
All police vehicles feature a standard black and white livery.
The police officers in the countryside employ a large, four-by-four Ranger , based on the Rancher , for pursuit on rough terrain.
Early design for the SFPD  Police  car which bears more of a resemblance to the Chevrolet Caprice than its final design.
An early and unnamed FBI car, later adapted into the LVPD  Police  car.
A close up of the LSPD police car engine.
The GTA Advance rendition of the Police is designed to bear a likeness to the Police from GTA III, with a generally rounded profile and a black-white paintjob.
Unlike other renditions, the car is substantially more speedy, with a top speed matched with the Banshee  s.
Being a mid-sized car, crushing the Police will only award the player with a base amount of $532.
For much of the games which exist within the HD universe, police cars exist in the form of generations of the Ford Crown Victoria, paralleling the widespread popularity of the car among police forces across America.
Other variants of police cars exist, an example being the Merit -based Police Patrol in GTA IV  inspired by the NYPD s use of the Chevrolet Impala 9C1 Police Package  , and the Buffalo -based cruiser in TBoGT and GTA V  inspired by USA and Canada police force usage of the Dodge Charger Police Package  .
The player can get in any police car and access the police computer while stationary.
The siren on both police cars features some variations, including the classic  code-3 siren  wail, the yelp when the siren is activated and the horn button held down, and, if the siren is turned off and the horn button held down, a distorted  crowd control  air horn, as used in real life.
The air horn is the most common horn sound which is available for both police cars  and other emergency vehicles .
Officers in real life use it to pull over people and respond to domestic calls  but when cruising, police sometimes honk regular horn rather than air horn  In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas you can do it by rapidly turning it on and of until just the lights are on as if you where not in the police car with the lights on.
The player can dial 911 to summon the police car by luring them to a false alarm.
Stealing the car  while the officer searches for any incidents , will attract a one-star Wanted level .
In some places, a police car can be stolen from a parking lot or curbside without incurring a Wanted level.
Police cars in GTA Chinatown Wars are simply dubbed   Police Patrols  , the same name for those seen in GTA IV.
While having reverted to a panda body colour scheme, the car incorporates GTA IV s police computer for use in vigilante side missions.
Although the car is implied to be similar to GTA IV s Declasse-based Police Patrol, pre-rendered depictions of the Police Patrol and the Police Cruiser are used during   busted   sequences in the game.
Four types of police cars are seen in GTA V.
The first one is the Police Cruiser , based on the second-generation Vapid Stanier , along with a Sheriff variant .
The second is the Vapid Interceptor , which is also named Police Cruiser in game, which is the most common type of law enforcement vehicle used by the Los Santos Police Department.
The third is the Police Buffalo , which is again named Police Cruiser in game.
The fourth is the Esperanto -based Police Roadcruiser , which cannot be obtained and is only seen in the Prologue .
The North Yankton State Patrol Police Roadcruiser uses a second variant, an LED lightbar that flashes side-by-side only.
All police cars are equipped with four siren codes: wail, yelp and phaser respectively.
Police cars are usually parked in front of police stations and are often locked.
Like all other police cars, they can be found at every police station in Los Santos in Grand Theft Auto V .
The feature of dialing 911 for a police car returns in GTA V , in the form of a contact on the player s in game phone.
Other cars won t pull over if you are driving a police car with a distorted siren.
LSPD Car, however the car has the rims of the Police car and Taxi in GTA Vice City.
In GTA III, if you look carefully on the front grille of Police Car, you can see a manufacturer badge, which resembles the one which real-life car company Ford uses.
If the player in San Andreas were to turn on the Ninja Theme cheat, the Police Car will still appear but the car is completely blacked out thus making it a unique paint scheme.
The player can keep it by simply stealing the car, turning the cheat off, and saving it in their safehouse s garage.
GTA III police cars arguably have the most realistic sirens compared to the other renditions in the 3D Universe .
In the GTA San Andreas, the police car in the parking lot of Las Venturas Police Headquarters is only location that the police car is alarmed.
In GTA V, police cars that features rear window sirens are programmed to alternate each lights, however, if you look closely on the red one, there s a brief moment where both red lights were on, which is absent on the blue light.
The GTA III police car is equipped with a secondary light bar resembling a McDermott High Rise lightbar.
A fairly noticeable, yet commonly overlooked and unseen, glitch is present in the police cruiser in Liberty City Stories .
When you achieve a 3 Star Wanted level, the police cruiser exceeds its top speed, being able to catch up to a Cheetah with minimal effort.
It is more tactical to use a car that has good brakes, doesn t swerve, and hugs the road when this glitch occurs.
Police say a Winslow Township Police Unit collided with another vehicle at 235 S.
So when a patrolman in Braintree, Massachusetts, spotted a Maserati resembling a police cruiser over the weekend, he pulled it over.
Deputy Chief Wayne Foster tells The Patriot Ledge r the luxury Italian vehicle s body was painted black and white with a police-style shield on the doors, and police-related decals.
Foster said the door shield wasn t accompanied by the usual police phrase  Protect and Serve,  but rather with  Decepticons punish and enslave.
The driver told the officer who pulled him over that he was actually assisting police  because other drivers noticed him and slowed down, thinking it was a police vehicle.
The driver, whose name was not made public, was summoned to court to face a charge of impersonating a police officer.
A 30-year-old handcuffed suspect escaped the back seat of a Cleveland police car, officers said.
The patrolmen handcuffed the man -- behind the back -- and placed him in the back seat of their patrol car.
The officers left the car to help the vice unit pacify a nearby crowd.
Cleveland police have not released additional information.
In May of 1994, inspired hackers created what might just become one of the most famous Dome hacks of all time, by placing what appeared to be a real MIT Campus Police cruiser on top of the dome, complete with flashing lights.
The car turned out to be the outer metal parts of a Chevrolet Cavalier attached to a multi-piece wooden frame, all carefully assembled on the roof over the course of one night.
Not only had the Chevy been painted to look just like a Campus Police car from all sides, but a dummy dressed up as a police officer sat within, with a toy disc gun and a box of donuts .
The car, numbered ``pi,   also sported a pair of fuzzy dice, the license number ``IHTFP,   an MIT Campus Police parking ticket  ``no permit for this location   , and a yellow diamond-shaped sign on the back window proclaiming ``I break for donuts.
Local people, reporters, and camera crews began to gather around 8, smiling, talking, taking pictures, and just generally watching as MIT Physical Plant began the slow dismantling of the car.
Not only did the local TV stations air footage of the car --- some of which later wound up on national news --- but the AP story  available on the Web to MIT people via Athena  spread to newspapers around the globe, from California to Korea and even Israel.
On Monday evening, a slide at the Lecture Series Committe  LSC  movie read ``MISSING: one white and blue patrol car.
The number is, of course, the local number for the MIT Campus Police.
As an interesting side note, though the television broadcasts reported a wailing police siren in addition to the lights, witnesses at the site insist that there was no such sound.

Yet somehow, police in Massachusetts realized that a Maserati isn’t likely to be a real cop car.
Because hello, $100,000  give or take a few thousand  sports car, you’ve clearly got better things to do than impersonating a police cruiser.
Maserati that was “made to look like a police cruiser,” including a black-and-white paint job with a police-ish shield on the doors and the appropriate decals, reports the Patriot-Ledger .
Another telltale sign — the vehicle was missing the blue police lights on top.
A patrol officer found himself behind the Maserati and found it funny, because he “didn’t know of any  police  department that had a Maserati,” so he pulled the car over.
The driver insisted that he was actually doing police a favor by driving around, “because other drivers noticed him and slowed down, thinking it was a police vehicle.

An unidentified Braintree man was summoned to district court and charged with impersonating a police officer due to painting his Maserati to look like a police car.

Braintree Deputy Police Chief Wayne Foster passed the car in Braintree Square.
Foster told the Patriot Ledger , he pulled the car over because he “didn’t know of any  police  department that had a Maserati.

In this case we have local police, Sheriff and State police violating our law, so we have work to do.
It’s our job to police the government.
I wrote an article here with some tips on filming police.
The government apologists have been working to convince people this law does not apply to police.
They assert that exempt vehicles include “sheriff AND “local police” AND “local peace officers” undercover.
A vehicle marking exemption for vehicles used by sheriffs, local police and local peace officers is continued but is limited to vehicles used for undercover or confidential investigative purposes.
Some also suggest that State Patrol  WSP  can exempt any car they want, because there is a note in section  3  that states ” Traffic control vehicles of the Washington state patrol” may be exempted by the chief.
Then, there was no exception but for “special or general police purpose”.
This section shall not apply to vehicles of the Washington State Patrol, sheriff’s office, police department, or any vehicles used by peace officers under public authority for special or general police purpose : Provided, It shall be lawful and constitute compliance with the provisions of this section for any department or office to adopt and use in lieu of the lettering required a distinctive insignia, approved by the state commission on equipment, and bearing substantially the same information as required herein.
The bottom line is that the law is clear and to suggest that any of it’s text exempts local police and sheriffs entirely is ridiculous and denies the grammatical structure of American English, the text of the bill and the published intent of the bill.
Not your typical police car: Military vehicles put to new use back in U.
Since 1995, the Pentagon has given $4 billion worth of military equipment to local police forces, everything from tactical gear to weapons to those mine resistant, ambush protected vehicles known as MRAPs.
The vehicle is unarmed -- its gun turret has been removed -- but the reinforced steel doors and pressurized cab offer protection not afforded by a patrol car.
The $650,000, 5-mile-to-the-gallon MRAP, and this armored Humvee, came free of charge through a defense department program that transfers surplus equipment to state and local police departments.
Last November, the Boise, Idaho, police department used its MRAP to arrest a kidnapping suspect believed to be barricaded with explosives.
We ve seen a number of instances in which police departments receive training that suggests that they have what we call a warrior type mentality,  she said.
We think the bottom line is that the police are here to protect and serve, not treat our neighborhoods like war zones,  she said.
