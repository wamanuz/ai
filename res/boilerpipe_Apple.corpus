The Price to Earnings  P E  ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock s most        recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations        for the trailing 12 month period.
A company s net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.
Reflects the total market value of a company.
Market Cap is calculated by multiplying        the number of shares outstanding by the stock s price.
For companies with multiple        common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes.
Number of shares that are currently held by investors,        including restricted shares owned by the company s officers and        insiders as well as those held by the public.
The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade.
To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.
Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded.
A company s dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased.
Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report.

Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.
Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock,     based on the value of trades made on an  uptick  in price and the value of     trades made on a  downtick  in price.
The up down ratio is calculated by     dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades.
Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

Apple was founded by Steve Jobs , Steve Wozniak , and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976, to develop and sell personal computers .
It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc.
January 3, 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc.
January 9, 2007, to reflect its shifted focus towards consumer electronics .
Apple is the world s second-largest information technology company by revenue after Samsung Electronics , and the world s second-largest mobile phone maker after Samsung .
4] Fortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.
5]     On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world s most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group  s  Best Global Brands  report.
10] However, the company has received criticism for its contractors  labor practices, as well as for its own environmental and business practices.
As of June 2014, Apple maintains 425 retail stores in fourteen countries,   as well as the online Apple Store and iTunes Store ,  the latter of which is the world s largest music retailer.
14] Apple is the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization , with an estimated market capitalization of $446 billion by January 2014.
15] As of September 29, 2012, the company had 72,800 permanent full-time employees and 3,300 temporary full-time employees worldwide.
Its worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.
16] As of Q1 2014, Apple s five-year growth average is 39% for top line growth and 45% for bottom line growth.
In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the Fortune 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.
9 billion.
18] According to the Boston Consulting Group  50 Most Innovative Companies  ranking, Apple is also the world s most innovative brand in 2014 .
Apple occupies this rank since 2005.
The Apple I , Apple s first product, was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.
The owner of this unit added a keyboard and a wooden case.
Apple was established on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs , Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne   to sell the Apple I personal computer kit.
The Apple I kits were a computer single handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak   and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club .
24] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard  with CPU , RAM , and basic textual-video chips , which is less than what is today considered a complete personal computer.
66  $2,763 in 2014 dollars, adjusted for inflation .
Apple was incorporated January 3, 1977,  without Wayne, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800.
21] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.
During the first five years of operations, revenues doubled every four months, an average growth rate of 700%.
The Apple II , also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire .
It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET , because of its character cell-based color graphics and an open architecture .
While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1 4 inch floppy disk drive and interface, the Disk II .
The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first   killer app   of the business world, VisiCalc , a spreadsheet program .
36] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users compatibility with the office, an additional reason to buy an Apple II.
36] Apple was a distant third place to Commodore and Tandy until VisiCalc came along.
By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line.
The company introduced the Apple III in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with IBM and Microsoft in the business and corporate computing market.
Jobs and several Apple employees, including Jef Raskin , visited Xerox PARC in December 1979 to see the Xerox Alto .
Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares  800,000 split-adjusted shares  of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.
40] Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface   GUI  , and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa .
On December 12, 1980, Apple went public at $22 per share,  generating more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956 and instantly creating more millionaires  about 300  than any company in history.
Apple s  1984  television ad , set in a dystopian future modeled after the George Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty-Four , set the tone for the introduction of the Macintosh.
Apple began working on the Apple Lisa in 1978.
In 1982, Jobs was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting.
Jobs took over Jef Raskin s low-cost-computer project, the Macintosh .
A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first.
Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.
In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh.
5 million television commercial  1984  .
It was directed by Ridley Scott and was aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.
45] It is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple s success  and a  masterpiece .
The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong  due to its high price and limited range of software titles.
The Macintosh was the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language at all.
The machine s fortunes changed with the introduction of the LaserWriter , the first PostScript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price, and PageMaker , an early desktop publishing package.
It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.
51] The Mac was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.
In 1985 a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO John Sculley , who had been hired two years earlier.
52] The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to  contain  Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products.
Rather than submit to Sculley s direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.
Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which Apple s board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.
49] Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc.
The Macintosh Portable was Apple s first  portable  Macintosh computer, released in 1989.
5 kilograms  17 lb  with a 12-hour battery life.
After the Macintosh Portable, Apple introduced the PowerBook in 1991.
The same year, Apple introduced System 7 , a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities.
It remained the architectural basis for Mac OS until 2001.
The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.
52] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process.
The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the  first golden age  of the Macintosh.
Following the success of the Macintosh LC , Apple introduced the Centris line, a low-end Quadra , and the ill-fated Performa line that was sold with an overwhelming number of configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as Sears , Price Club , and Wal-Mart  the primary dealers for these models .
Consumers ended up confused and did not understand the difference between models.
During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including digital cameras , portable CD audio players , speakers , video consoles , and TV appliances .
Apple saw the Apple II series as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low-end Macintosh.
55] In 1990, Apple released the Macintosh LC with a single expansion slot for the Apple IIe Card to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.
55] Apple stopped selling the Apple IIe in 1993.
Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered, but expensive, experience.
56] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response.
Instead, they sued Microsoft for using a graphical user interface similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc.
Microsoft Corporation .
57] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.
At the same time, a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied Apple s reputation, and Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler .
The Newton was Apple s first foray into the PDA markets, as well as one of the first in the industry.
Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the Palm Pilot and Apple s own iPhone and iPad in the future.
By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the A UX .
Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called eWorld , developed in collaboration with America Online and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as CompuServe .
The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware.
In addition, Apple was facing competition from OS 2 and UNIX vendors such as Sun Microsystems .
The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.
In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and Motorola in the AIM alliance .
The goal was to create a new computing platform  the PowerPC Reference Platform  , which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple s software.
The AIM alliance hoped that PReP s performance and Apple s software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft.
The same year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh , the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola s PowerPC processor.
In 1996, Michael Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO.
Gil Amelio made many changes at Apple, including extensive layoffs.
61] After numerous failed attempts to improve Mac OS, first with the Taligent project, then later with Copland and Gershwin , Amelio chose to purchase NeXT and its NeXTSTEP operating system, bringing Steve Jobs back to Apple as an advisor.
62] On July 9, 1997, Amelio was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.
Jobs acted as the interim CEO and began restructuring the company s product line; it was during this period that Jobs identified Jonathan Ive  s design talent and the pair worked collaboratively to rebuild Apple s status.
At the 1997 Macworld Expo , Jobs announced that Apple would join Microsoft to release new versions of Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, and that Microsoft had made a $150 million investment in non-voting Apple stock.
64] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Online Store , tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.
On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the Macintosh 128K : the iMac .
The iMac design team was led by Ive, who would later design the iPod and the iPhone .
67]  The iMac featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.
Through this period, Apple purchased several companies to create a portfolio of professional and consumer-oriented digital production software.
In 1998, Apple purchased Macromedia  s Final Cut Pro software, signaling its expansion into the digital video editing market.
70] The following year, Apple released two video editing products: iMovie for consumers and, for professionals, Final Cut Pro , which has gone on to be a significant video-editing program, with 800,000 registered users in early 2007.
71] In 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake ,  as well as Emagic for their music productivity application Logic , which led to the development of their consumer-level GarageBand application.
73]  iPhoto  s release the same year completed the iLife suite.
Mac OS X , based on NeXT s OPENSTEP and BSD Unix , was released on March 24, 2001 after several years of development.
Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X aimed to combine the stability, reliability and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface.
To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9 , the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X as the Classic environment , which meant that users were able to continue running their old applications.
On May 19, 2001, Apple opened the first official Apple Retail Stores in Virginia and California.
77] On July 9, they bought Spruce Technologies, a DVD authoring company.
On October 23 of the same year, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player, first sold on November 10.
The product was phenomenally successful — over 100 million units were sold within six years.
99 a song and integration with the iPod.
The service quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 5 billion downloads by June 19, 2008.
Since 2001, Apple s design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the iMac G3 .
This began with the PowerBook , made with titanium , and was followed by the iBook  s white polycarbonate structure and the flat-panel iMac .
The MacBook Pro , Apple s first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, announced in January 2006.
At the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would begin producing Intel -based Mac computers in 2006.
83] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel s Core Duo CPU.
By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.
83] The Power Mac, iBook and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro , MacBook , and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.
84]  On April 29, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.
86] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.
Apple s success during this period was evident in its stock price.
Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple s stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share  split-adjusted  to over $80.
In January 2006, Apple s market cap surpassed that of Dell .
Apple achieved widespread success with its iPhone , iPod Touch and iPad products, which introduced innovations in mobile phones , portable music players and personal computers respectively.
90] In addition, the implementation of a store for the purchase of software applications represented a new business model .
Touch screens had been invented and seen in mobile devices before, but Apple was the first to achieve mass market adoption of such a user interface that included particular pre-programmed touch gestures.
Delivering his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc.
The event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the Apple TV .
80, an all-time high at that point.
In May, Apple s share price passed the $100 mark.
In an article posted on Apple s website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management  DRM , thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.
96] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI s catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.
97] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce the corresponding changes to the iTunes Store.
In July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch .
99] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.
100] By October 2008 Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.
On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that 2009 would be the last year the corporation would be attending the Macworld Expo, after more than 20 years of attendance.
The announcement also explained that senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing Philip Schiller would deliver the 2009 keynote address in lieu of the expected Jobs.
The official press release explained that Apple was  scaling back  on trade shows generally, with Macworld Tokyo and Apple Expo in Paris, France two other events that the corporation had ceased attendance at.
The enormous success of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows into a minor promotional channel and was cited as the primary reason for the change.
On January 14, 2009, an internal memo from Jobs announced that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009, during which time he would focus on his health.
21 billion.
After years of speculation and multiple rumored  leaks , Apple announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010.
The iPad runs the same touch based operating system that the iPhone uses and many of the same iPhone apps are compatible with the iPad.
This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch even with very little development time before the release.
Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US and sold more than 300,000 units on that day, reaching 500,000 by the end of the first week.
107] In May of the same year, Apple s market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.
Apple released the iPhone 4 , which introduced video calling , multitasking , and a new uninsulated stainless steel design, which acts as the phone s antenna.
Because of this antenna implementation, some iPhone 4 users reported a reduction in signal strength when the phone is held in specific ways.
After a large amount of media coverage including mainstream news organizations, Apple held a press conference where they offered buyers a free rubber  bumper  case, which had been proven to eliminate the signal reduction issue.
Later that year Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players which introduced a multi-touch iPod Nano , iPod Touch with FaceTime , and iPod Shuffle with buttons which brought back the buttons of earlier generations.
In October 2010, Apple shares hit an all-time high, eclipsing $300.

116] In June 2011, Steve Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud , an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple s previous attempt at content syncing.
This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.
It has been argued that Apple has achieved such efficiency in its supply chain  that the company operates as a monopsony  one buyer, many sellers , in that it can dictate terms to its suppliers.

Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers, due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone s cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna.
The issue was corrected by a  Bumper Case  distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months.
In June 2011, Apple overtook Nokia to become the world s biggest smartphone maker by volume.
On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S , which was first released on October 14, 2011.
199] It features the Apple A5 processor, and is the first model offered by Sprint  joining AT&T and Verizon Wireless as the United States carriers offering iPhone models .
On October 19, 2011, Apple announced an agreement with C Spire Wireless to sell the iPhone 4S with that carrier in the near future, marking the first time the iPhone was officially supported on a regional carrier s network.

204] Two million iPhones were sold in the first twenty-four hours of pre-ordering  and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch.
A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user s habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly.
Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.
In March 2013, one of the largest cellular phone companies in the United States, T-Mobile , announced that it would begin selling the iPhone 5 on April 12.
The announcement of the iPhone came with the announcement that the company would begin implementing 4G cellular service for its users.
Upon the launch of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C , Apple sold over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch, which sets a new record for first-weekend smartphone sales.

The current generation Apple TV.
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the Apple TV ,  previously known as the iTV ,  a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions.
The device links up to a user s TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer s iTunes library and streams from an additional four.
The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40 GB hard drive for storage, includes outputs for HDMI and component video , and plays video at a maximum resolution of 720p .
214] On May 31, 2007 a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model  and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.
In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV.
On September 1, 2010, alongside the release of the new line of iPod devices for the year, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV.
The new device is 1 4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of flash memory to cache media downloaded.
Apple with the Apple TV has added another device to its portfolio that runs on its A4 processor along with the iPad and the iPhone.
The memory included in the device is the half of the iPhone 4 at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation iPod Touch .
It has HDMI out as the only video out source.
Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows  purchasing has been discontinued , streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library.
Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99.
A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution  1080p  and a new user interface.
The Apple Watch is a smartwatch announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014.
It has fitness tracking capabilities similar to Fitbit .
It requires an iPhone 5 or above to work.
The release date is early 2015, starting at $349.

Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its OS X operating system.
Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers.
An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles iMovie , iPhoto and GarageBand .
For presentation, page layout and word processing, iWork is available, which includes Keynote , Pages , and Numbers .
Tunes, QuickTime media player, and Software Update are available as free downloads for both OS X and Windows .
Apple also offers a range of professional software titles.

For the professional creative market, there is Aperture for professional RAW -format photo processing; Final Cut Pro , a video production suite; Logic Pro , a comprehensive music toolkit; and Motion , an advanced effects composition program.
Apple also offers online services with iCloud , which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos and documents.
It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality.
Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.
First official Apple logo from May 17, 1976 to August 26, 1999.
Current Apple logo since August 27, 1999.
According to Steve Jobs, Apple was so named because Jobs was coming back from an apple farm, and he was on a fruitarian diet.
He thought the name was  fun, spirited and not intimidating .
Apple s first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree.
It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff  s  rainbow Apple , the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.
Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the  bitten  logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it.
While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.
220]  The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.
222] The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.
222] This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing , with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide .
223]  Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.
On August 27, 1999   the following year after the iMac G3 was introduced , Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising.
An Aqua -themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1999 to 2003, and a Glass-themed version was used from 2007 to 2013.
With the release of iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks in late 2013, the logo appears flat and white with no glossy effects.
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were Beatles fans,   but Apple Inc.
Apple Corps Ltd.
Beatles in 1967, involving their name and logo.
This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies.
These issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.
Apple s first slogan,   Byte into an Apple , was coined in the late 1970s.
228] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan   Think Different   was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.
229] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines — for example,  iThink, therefore iMac  was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,  and  Say hello to iPhone  has been used in iPhone advertisements.
231]  Hello  was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton , iMac   hello  again   , and iPod.
Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 Super Bowl commercial to the more modern   Get a Mac   adverts, Apple has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products, though its advertising was criticized for the claims made by some later campaigns, particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads    and iPhone ads in Britain.
Apple s product commercials gained fame for launching musicians into stardom as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.
236] First, the company popularized Canadian singer Feist s   1234   song in its ad campaign.
236] Later, Apple used the song   New Soul   by French-Israeli singer-songwriter Yael Naïm to promote the MacBook Air .
236] The debut single shot to the top of the charts and sold hundreds of thousands of copies in a span of weeks.
Apple aficionados wait in line around the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York City in anticipation of a new product.
Apple s brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product.
At one time, Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established.
Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism  something that was stumbled upon,   while Ive explained in 2014 that  People have an incredibly personal relationship  with Apple s products.
Mac users previously meet at the European Apple Expo and the San Francisco Macworld Conference & Expo trade shows, where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year, to both the industry and public, until Apple pulled out of both events—the conferences continue, but Apple is not officially represented at either event.
Apple Store openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.
239] The New York City Fifth Avenue  Cube  store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.
240] The Ginza opening in Tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.
John Sculley told The Guardian newspaper in 1997:  People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade.   Research in 2002 by NetRatings indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers.
The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc.
PC products.
What people are responding to is much bigger than the object.
They are responding to something rare — a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can.
It’s a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.

During the Mac s early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.
252] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple s adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500   8500   9500 Power Macs .
Apple has since adopted USB , AGP , HyperTransport , Wi-Fi , and other industry standards in its computers.
FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 .
Silicon Valley , at 1–6 Infinite Loop , Cupertino , California.
This Apple campus has six buildings that total 850,000 square feet  79,000 m2  and was built in 1993 by Sobrato Development Cos.
In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus on 50 acres  200,000 m2  assembled from various contiguous plots  east of N Wolfe Road between Pruneridge Avenue and Vallco Parkway .
Later acquisitions increased this to 175 acres.
6 km  east of the current campus.
255] The new campus building will be designed by Norman Foster .
On October 15, 2013, the Cupertino City Council approved the proposed  spaceship  design campus.
On June 7, 2011, Jobs had given a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs.
The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building  with a café for 3,000 sitting people integrated  surrounded by extensive landscape  with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure .
The new campus will be built on the former HP headquarters, next to Interstate 280.
Our home for innovation and creativity for decades to come.
8 million square foot facility, which will include Jobs s original designs for a fitness center and corporate auditorium, will be able to house 14,000 employees, with enough parking space to accommodate almost every employee.
Apple s headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa  EMEA  are located in Cork in the south of Ireland .
143]       The facility, which opened in 1980, was Apple s first location outside of the United States.
264] Apple Sales International, which deals with all of Apple s international sales outside of the USA, is located at Apple s campus in Cork  along with Apple Distribution International, which similarly deals with Apple s international distribution network.
On April 20, 2012, Apple added 500 new jobs at its European headquarters, increasing the total workforce from around 2,800 to 3,300 employees.
257]   The company will build a new office block on its Hollyhill Campus to accommodate the additional staff.
Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include Southwest Airlines and Microsoft .
Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like IBM by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a Fortune 500 company.
By the time of the  1984  TV ad , this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors.
269] According to a 2011 report in Fortune , this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.
As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ.
This was especially after Jobs s return.
To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company.
The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including Bill Atkinson ,  Steve Capps ,  Rod Holt,  Alan Kay ,   Guy Kawasaki ,   Al Alcorn ,  Don Norman ,  Rich Page ,  and Steve Wozniak .
Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability.
Each project has a  directly responsible individual,  or  DRI  in Apple jargon.
270] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple s official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app , he was forced to resign.
277] Numerous employees of Apple have cited that projects without Jobs s involvement often took longer than projects with his involvement.
At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.
Jobs saw this as a means of having  best-in-class  employees in every role.
For instance, Ron Johnson —Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet he had no control of the inventory in his stores  which is done company wide by Cook, who has a background in supply-chain management .
This is the opposite of General Electric  s corporate culture, which aims to create well-rounded managers.
The company s manufacturing, procurement and logistics enables it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories.
In 2011, Apple s profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies.
Cook s catchphrase to describe his focus on the company s operational arm is: “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.
The company previously advertised its products as being made in America up until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad.
According to a report by the New York Times , Apple insiders  believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products .
S.
Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives, which does not include perks that other CEOs enjoy  such as country club fees and private use of company aircraft .
The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.
A media article published in July 2013 provided details about Apple s  At-Home Apple Advisors  customer support program that serves as the corporation s call center.
S.
The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour, and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.
In 1999 Jobs retained Eight Inc.
Apple retail store, and began the search for senior retail and development executives.
Tim Kobe of Eight Inc.
The first two Apple Stores opened on May 19, 2001: the first opening was at Tysons Corner, Virginia, and the Glendale, California store, at the Glendale Galleria , opened later in the day due to the time zone difference.
More than 7,700 people visited Apple’s first two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.
After the first Apple Store opened, Apple sold third-party accessories,  such as Nikon and Canon digital cameras.
Adobe , one of Apple s oldest software partners,  also sells its Mac-compatible software, as does Microsoft, who sells Microsoft Office for the Mac.
The books of John Wiley & Sons , the publishers of the For Dummies series of instructional books, were banned from Apple Stores in 2005, because Jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized Jobs biography called iCon .
287] After the launch of the iBookstore , Apple stopped selling physical books, both online and at the Apple Retail Stores.
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings  and claims since it began operation and, like its competitors and peers, engages in litigation  trying legal cases before the courts  in its normal course of business for a variety of reasons.
In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests.
In its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc.
108 billion in annual revenues – a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion – and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.
Apple achieved these results while losing market share in certain product categories.
65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.
On September 2012, Apple reached a record share price of more than $705 and closed at above 700.
291] With 936,596,000 outstanding shares  as of June 30, 2012 ,  it had a market capitalization of about $660 billion.
At the time, this was the highest nominal market capitalization ever reached by a publicly traded company, surpassing a record set by Microsoft in 1999.
On April 21, 2011, Greenpeace released a report highlighting the fact that data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase.
293] On April 17, 2012, following a Greenpeace protest of Apple, Apple Inc.
100% clean energy.
294]  By 2013 Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers, and overall 75% of its power came from renewable sources.
In 2010, Climate Counts , a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category  Striding .
297] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a  stuck icon , adding that Apple at the time was  a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer .
Greenpeace has campaigned against Apple because of various environmental issues, including a global end-of-life take-back plan, non-recyclable hardware components and toxins within iPhone hardware.
299]  Since 2003 Greenpeace has campaigned against Apple s use of particular chemicals in its products, more specifically, the inclusion of PVC and BFRs in their devices.
299] On May 2, 2007, Steve Jobs released a report announcing plans to eliminate PVC and BFRs by the end of 2008.
301]  Apple has since eliminated PVC and BFRs from its product range,  becoming the first laptop manufacturer to do so.

The Environmental Protection Agency rates Apple highest amongst producers of notebooks, and fairly well compared to producers of desktop computers and LCD displays .
In June 2007, Apple upgraded the MacBook Pro , replacing cold cathode fluorescent lamp  CCFL  backlit LCD displays with mercury -free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic -free glass,  and has since done this for all notebooks.
Apple has also left out BFRs and PVCs in various internal components.
301]   Apple offers information about emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning each product.
In June 2009, Apple s iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, BFRs and had an efficient power adapter.
In October 2009, Apple upgraded the iMac and MacBook, replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp  CCFL  backlit LCD displays with mercury-free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass.
312] This means all Apple computers have mercury free LED backlit displays, arsenic-free glass and are without PVC cables.
All Apple computers also have EPEAT Gold status.
In October 2011, Chinese authorities ordered an Apple supplier to close part of its plant in Suzhou after residents living nearby raised significant environmental concerns.
In November 2011, Apple featured in Greenpeace  s Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how  green  their products are.

314] Greenpeace praises Apple s sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010.
It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants.
However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.
314] In January 2012, Apple requested that their cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.
In 2006, the Mail on Sunday reported on the working conditions that existed at factories in China where the contract manufacturers Foxconn and Inventec produced the iPod.
319] The article stated that one complex of factories that assembles the iPod  among other items  had over 200,000 workers that lived and worked in the factory, with employees regularly working more than 60 hours per week.
The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers  earnings.
Apple immediately launched an investigation and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.
323] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker s rights , slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply.
Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008.
324] In 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens.
One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.
325] After a spate of suicides in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit at a lower rate than in China as a whole,  workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.
In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers  child labor practices in China had worsened.
Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to n- hexane , a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.
In 2013, China Labor Watch said it found violations of the law and of Apple s pledges about working conditions at facilities operated by Pegatron , including discrimination against ethnic minorities and women, withholding employees  pay, excessive work hours, poor living conditions, health and safety problems and pollution.
Apple created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as the Republic of Ireland , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world.
According to the New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes.
In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the   Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich ,  which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.
UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporation tax .
He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company , to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues.
Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.
In June 2014 the European Commissioner for Competition launched an investigation of Apple s tax practices in Ireland , as part of a wider probe of multi-national companies  tax arrangements in various European countries.
As of 2014, Apple is listed as a partner of the Product RED campaign, together with other brands such as Nike, Girl, American Express and Converse.

Get answers to frequently asked questions about two-step verification for Apple ID.
What is two-step verification for Apple ID?
Two-step verification is an additional security feature for your Apple ID that s designed to prevent anyone from accessing or using your account, even if they know your password.
Why should I use two-step verification with my Apple ID?
Your Apple ID is the key to many things you do with Apple.
It s important that only you have the ability to access your account details, update your password, access the data you store and keep up to date with iCloud, or make iTunes and App Store purchases with your account.
Two-step verification is a feature you can use to keep your Apple ID and personal information as secure as possible.
How do I set up two-step verification?
Select Password and Security.
Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions.
How does it work?
When you set up two-step verification, you register one or more trusted devices.
A trusted device is a device you control that can receive 4-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone.
You re required to provide at least one SMS capable phone number.
After you sign in, you can securely access your account or make purchases as usual.
Without both your password and the verification code, access to your account will be denied.
You will also get a 14-character Recovery Key to print and keep in a safe place.
Use your Recovery Key to regain access to your account if you ever lose access to your trusted devices or forget your password.
Do I still need to remember any security questions?
With two-step verification, you don t need to create or remember any security questions.
Your identity is verified exclusively using your password, verification codes sent to your trusted devices, and your Recovery Key.
Which SMS numbers should I verify for my account?
You re required to verify at least one SMS-capable phone number for your account.
You should consider verifying all SMS-capable phone numbers that you normally use with your iPhone or another mobile phone.
You should also consider verifying an SMS-capable phone number used by someone close to you, such as a spouse or other family member.
You can use this number if you re temporarily without access to your own devices.
Note: You can t use landline or web-based  VOIP  phone services for two-step verification.
How do I use Find My iPhone notifications to receive verification codes?
Find My iPhone notifications can be used to receive verification codes on any iOS device with Find My iPhone turned on.
Learn how to set up Find My iPhone .
Where should I keep my Recovery Key?
Keep your Recovery Key in a secure place in your home, office, or other location.
You should consider printing more than one copy, so that you can keep your key in more than one place.
Your key will be easier to find if you ever need it, and you ll have a spare copy if one is ever lost or destroyed.
You shouldn t store your Recovery Key on your device or computer, because that could give an unauthorized user instant access to your key.
What if I want to sign in to iCloud using an app that doesn’t support two-step verification for Apple ID?
If you use iCloud with any third party apps, such as email, address book, or calendar clients, you can create app-specific passwords that let you sign in securely, even if the app that you re using doesn t support two-step verification.
Select Password and Security.
What do I need to remember when I use two-step verification?
Two-step verification simplifies and strengthens the security of your Apple ID.
After you turn it on, there s no way for anyone to access and manage your account other than by using your password, verification codes sent to your trusted devices, or your Recovery Key.
Only you can reset your password, manage your trusted devices, or create a new Recovery Key.
Apple Support can help you with other aspects of your service, but they aren t able to update or recover these three things for you.
What if I lose my Recovery Key?
Select Password and Security.
Under Recovery Key, select Replace Lost Key.
What if I forget my Apple ID password?
Apple Support can t reset your password for you.
To reset your password, you must have your Recovery Key and access to at least one of your trusted devices.
What if I lose or give away one of my trusted devices?
If you no longer have access to one of your devices, go to My Apple ID as soon as possible to remove that device from your list of trusted devices.
That device can then no longer be used to help verify your identity.
What if I no longer have access to any of my trusted devices?
If you can t access any of your trusted devices, you can still access your account using your password and Recovery Key.
You should then verify a new trusted device as soon as possible.
Why was I asked to wait before setting up two-step verification?
As a basic security measure, Apple doesn t allow setup of two-step verification to proceed if significant changes were recently made to your Apple ID account information.
Significant changes can include a password reset or new security questions.
This waiting period helps Apple make sure that you are the only person accessing or modifying your account.
While you are in this waiting period, you can continue using your account as usual with all Apple services and stores.
Apple will send an email to all the addresses you have on file notifying you of the waiting period and encouraging you to contact Apple Support if you think that someone else has unauthorized access to your account.
You can set up two-step verification after the date listed on your Apple ID account page and in the email that you receive.
When your waiting period is over, you have 30 days to complete setup of two-step verification.
If you attempt to complete setup after 30 days have passed, or you made significant changes to your account during that time, another waiting period may be triggered.
Can I turn off two-step verification after I turn it on?
When additional countries are added, two-step verification automatically appears in the Password and Security section of your account when you sign in to My Apple ID .

It seems as though each new iOS update Apple releases has a negative impact on battery life for some users.
There are plenty of theories on why that might be, and they range from updated iPhones and iPads having to re-index files, to some users simply being unaware of increased usage as they explore new features.
The truth is that there are numerous issues that can impact iPhone and iPad battery life following an update, and it varies on a case by case basis.
1 earlier this month, BGR has received several emails from iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users who say that their battery life took a noticeable hit after updating to Apple’s latest software.
While there unfortunately isn’t one solution for everyone, we have found a simple trick that seems to help many users.

Mondays are hit or miss when it comes to paid iPhone and iPad apps that are made available for free for a limited time.
Developers often go crazy over the weekend and put dozens or even hundreds of poorly made apps on sale, so it can be difficult to pick out the diamonds in all that rough.
Luckily, we’re here to do the dirty work for you, and today we have eight great iOS apps that are typically worth a combined $28, but they’re all free downloads for a limited time if you hurry.

Remember back in June when I said Apple hoped to schedule a special event in October to show off a new wearable device?
Remember how I also said this: “Could things change between now and fall?
Turns out that was a prescient hedge, because things have changed.
Apple now plans to unveil a new wearable alongside the two next-generation iPhones we told you the company will debut on September 9 .
The new device will, predictably, make good use of Apple’s HealthKit health and fitness platform.
It will also — predictably — make good use of HomeKit, the company’s new framework for controlling connected devices — though it’s not clear how broadly or in what way.
Sure would be nice to turn the lights on and off from my wrist, though — or navigate my Apple TV  caution: Total speculation .
Oh.
Could things change between now and September 9?
That’s certainly possible — har-har — but I doubt it.
Invitations should be going out any day now, right?
No word yet on the fate of the October event I mentioned earlier this summer, though I imagine it’s still on.
With its best product pipeline in 25 years , Apple should have more than enough hardware to fill two events.

Drug store giants may be joining with other major retailers in developing a competing mobile wallet.
CVS follows Rite-Aid, shuts off Apple Pay Drug store giants may be joining with other major retailers in developing a competing mobile wallet.

Paul Ausick, 24 7 Wall St.
CVS announced in February it would no longer sell tobacco products.
Last Thursday drug store chain Rite Aid Inc.
RAD  reportedly stopped accepting payments made through the just launched Apple Pay system from Apple  AAPL  .
On Saturday, CVS Health  CVS  was reported to have followed suit at its CVS pharmacy stores.
The issue appears to be a conflict between Apple Pay and a mobile payment system called CurrentC that is being developed by a retailer-owned mobile technology outfit called Merchant Customer Exchange   MCX  .
Unlike Apple Pay, CurrentC does not use an NFC chip, but instead generates a QR code that is displayed on the merchant s checkout terminal.
Customers who have already linked their bank accounts to the CurrentC system scan the QR code from the terminal and the transaction is completed.
When Apple announced Apple Pay in early September, both Wal-Mart Stores  WMT   and Best Buy  BBY  said they had no plans to adopt the new system.
Both are partners in MCX along with other major retailers like Target  TGT  , Darden Restaurants  DRI  , and Sears Holdings  SHLD  .
MCX has been working on a mobile payment solution since 2011, and the driving force behind the effort is to enable the merchants to avoid paying the 2% to 3% credit card transaction fees charged by the likes of Visa  V  and MasterCard  MA  .
How much do these big retailers dislike paying fees to Visa and MasterCard?
I don t know that MCX will succeed, and I don t care.
That kind of attitude ought to help drive adoption of Apple Pay as well, but retailers have an investment in CurrentC and the system has begun real-world testing and is scheduled to go live early next year.
The advantage of CurrentC is that it works with existing checkout terminals, while Apple Pay requires that most retailers purchase new equipment to communicate with the NFC chip in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
Among the retailers that do not need to buy new terminals are Best Buy, Rite Aid, and CVS, so their reason for shutting down access to Apple Pay is very likely contractual or an act of solidarity with their fellow CurrentC backers.
CVS and the other CurrentC companies will almost certainly use the system exclusively for a relatively short time.
If, as most observers expect, customer demand for NFC-based systems like Apple Pay grows rapidly, these retailers are not going to adopt a  my way or the highway  attitude with their customers.
They have learned that when it comes to technology, it s a consumer-driven world and they just live in it.
And one other thing retailers have — or should have learned — is not to underestimate the power of Apple in the consumer world.

Apple said Wednesday night that it is making it impossible for the company to turn over data from most iPhones or iPads to police — even when they have a search warrant — taking a hard new line as tech companies attempt to blunt allegations that they have too readily participated in government efforts to collect user information.
The move, announced with the publication of a new privacy policy tied to the release of Apple’s latest mobile operating system, iOS 8, amounts to an engineering solution to a legal quandary: Rather than comply with binding court orders, Apple has reworked its latest encryption in a way that prevents the company — or anyone but the device’s owner — from gaining access to the vast troves of user data typically stored on smartphones or tablet computers.
The key is the encryption that Apple mobile devices automatically put in place when a user selects a passcode, making it difficult for anyone who lacks that passcode to access the information within, including photos, e-mails and recordings.
Apple once maintained the ability to unlock some content on devices for legally binding police requests but will no longer do so for iOS 8, it said in the new privacy policy.
Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data,” Apple said on its Web site.
As the new operating system becomes widely deployed over the next several weeks, the number of iPhones and iPads that Apple is capable of breaking into for police will steadily dwindle to the point where only devices several years old — and incapable of running iOS 8 — can be unlocked by Apple.
In a letter posted on the company s Web site, CEO Tim Cook said his company offered better privacy protection than his rivals.
Apple will still have the ability — and the legal responsibility — to turn over user data stored elsewhere, such as in its iCloud service, which typically includes backups of photos, videos, e-mail communications, music collections and more.
Users who want to prevent all forms of police access to their information will have to adjust settings in a way that blocks data from flowing to iCloud.
Apple’s new privacy policy comes less than five months after the Supreme Court ruled that police in most circumstances need a search warrant to collect information stored on phones.
Apple’s action makes that distinction largely moot by depriving itself of the power to comply with search warrants for the contents of many of the phones it sells.
The move is the latest in a series in which Apple has sought to distinguish itself from competitors through more rigorous security, especially in the aftermath of revelations about government spying made by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden last year.
Although the company’s security took a publicity hit with the leak of intimate photos of celebrities from their Apple accounts in recent weeks, the move to block police access to the latest iPhones and iPads will thrill privacy activists and frustrate law enforcement officials, who have come to rely on the extensive evidence often found on personal electronic devices.
This is a great move,” said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union.
Particularly after the Snowden disclosures, Apple seems to understand that consumers want companies to put their privacy first.
Ronald T.
Hosko, the former head of the FBI’s criminal investigative division, called the move by Apple “problematic,” saying it will contribute to the steady decrease of law enforcement’s ability to collect key evidence — to solve crimes and prevent them.
The agency long has publicly worried about the “going dark” problem, in which the rising use of encryption across a range of services has undermined government’s ability to conduct surveillance, even when it is legally authorized.
Our ability to act on data that does exist .
Hosko said.
He suggested that it would take a major event, such as a terrorist attack, to cause the pendulum to swing back toward giving authorities access to a broad range of digital information.
Many security experts have blamed security weaknesses in iCloud — some of which have since been fixed — for the recent leak of celebrity photos.
Several companies also make systems designed to crack the encryption of devices, including the iPhone and iPad.
Security experts generally consider Apple’s devices to be better protected against such attacks than some rivals’, although people with short passcodes — of four digits, for example — are in greater danger of what are called “brute force attacks” that relentlessly try all possible combinations.
Adding more security can make it harder for users to operate a mobile device.
People who forget their passcodes with iOS 8 will not be able to recover them by contacting Apple.
However, most users will have the bulk of their data automatically backed up on iCloud and would be able to restore their phones, although not before wiping them of all user data.

Steve Jobs’s office remains Steve Jobs’s office.
After his death in 2011, Tim Cook, his friend and successor as Apple   AAPL   chief executive officer, decided to leave the sparsely decorated room on the fourth floor of 1 Infinite Loop untouched.
It’s not a shrine or place of mourning, but just a space that Cook sensed no one could or should ever fill.
It felt right to leave it as it is,” he says.
The executive wing once radiated nervous energy, with handlers scurrying to anticipate the whims of Apple’s temperamental co-founder.
Now there’s tranquility in the hallways, a reflection of the new boss’s calm Southern demeanor.
Downstairs, the cafeterias are packed—the workforce has almost doubled.
A mile away, behind a ring of fences, construction crews are building the massive foundation for the circular “spaceship” campus that will accommodate 12,000 workers when it’s completed in a few years.
Until Sept.
9, all the other changes at the world’s most valuable and scrutinized company were largely invisible to the public.
Then Tim Cook took the stage at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts and laid out much of what Apple has been working on over the past three years.
The immediate aftermath is that Apple is swamped by a record number of preorders for the new iPhone 6 and supersize 6 Plus .
Bank of America   BAC  , Capital One   COF  , JPMorgan Chase   JPM  , and Wells Fargo   WFC  , among other banks, plus the major credit card companies and a number of nationwide retailers, have embraced the new mobile payment system, Apple Pay.
Even the Apple Watch, the company’s first attempt at launching an entirely new product category in the Cook era, has garnered an encouraging early response, though it will face the only test that matters when it hits stores sometime in 2015.
Cook is eager to declare all this as a decisive victory.
Anybody coming out of there yesterday knows that innovation is alive and well in Cupertino,” he says, rocking back and forth in a conference-room chair next to his office, an Apple Watch on his wrist.
Behind the product announcements is a different story.
When Cook took over from Jobs three years ago, the chances he could continue Apple’s epic run appeared slim.
The iPhone accounted for more than half of Apple’s revenue and the bulk of its gross profit.
At the same time the rise of phones made by Samsung Electronics   005930:KS   and other companies that ran Google’s   GOOG   free Android operating system had left Apple with a shrinking stake of the smartphone market.
A huge part of Apple’s business hinged on what seemed like a doomed strategy, evoking its defeat to Microsoft   MSFT   Windows in the PC battle of the 1980s and ’90s.
Cook didn’t take control of Apple under anything like ideal circumstances.
Even though Tim accepted the responsibility of being CEO with all the enthusiasm you’d expect,” says Robert Iger, Walt Disney’s   DIS   CEO and a member of Apple’s board, “it was dampened by a very deep sense of mourning.
It made the transition hard, not just for Tim but everybody initially.
The company Cook inherited was broken up into specialized groups devoted to hardware, software design, marketing, and finance, all working separately and sharing little information with each other; they didn’t need to because the overarching vision resided in Jobs’s head.
After Jobs died, say several people who were there at the time, it wasn’t clear such a decentralized structure could survive without a powerful guiding voice at the top.
For the first few months, no one had a clear mandate to make big decisions, and teams were tussling for turf.
The decisive moment for Cook came at the end of his first year as CEO when he fired Scott Forstall, one of Jobs’s most trusted lieutenants.
Forstall had led software development for the iPad and iPhone; he was also divisive and responsible for the poorly received Apple Maps and Siri voice recognition service.
There was an audible gasp in Apple’s offices when the dismissal was announced, say people who were there.
Cook immediately convened meetings with senior managers to explain how the new structure was going to work.
Jonathan Ive, Apple’s head of design, was given control over the look and feel of iOS while development of the mobile operating system was consolidated with Mac software under Craig Federighi, the senior vice president for software engineering.
It was a plan designed to break down walls and extinguish infighting, executed with precision.
A decade ago, when he first became a public figure, Cook, now 53, was often caricatured as Jobs’s logical, icy sidekick—the Spock to his Kirk.
In person, Cook defies those expectations.
He bounds toward Apple employees, posing for on-campus selfies and answering every question regardless of the holes it eats into his schedule.
He can also be quite emotional about a range of subjects close to his heart, from Auburn University football to social justice.
It’s easy to project this unfailing politeness onto Apple and deduce that the CEO’s demeanor has trickled down to the corporate ethos.
But this gives Cook too little credit.
Collaboration may be a virtue, but Cook insists it’s more of a strategic imperative.
Aligning thousands of employees is crucial now that “the lines between hardware, software, and services are blurred or are disappearing,” he says.
The only way you can pull this off is when everyone is working together well.
The result is only now becoming apparent with services that work across different Apple devices.
Embedded in the iPhone 6 and the new iOS 8 and Mac OS X Yosemite operating system is a feature called Continuity, which lets users start an e-mail or some other task on their Mac, pick it up on their iPhone, and then move it to their iPad or even the Apple Watch.
We would never have gotten there in the old model,” Cook says.
These new products are reminders “of why we exist.
I don’t consider the bloody ROI.
With the Apple Pay service, users will be able to touch their finger to the Touch ID finger scanner on their iPhone, tap their handset against a credit card terminal, and make a payment without having to turn on their phone or open an app.
It’s another illustration of Cook’s focus on products that combine hardware, software, and services—and it’s an important test for the company.
Apple doesn’t have a stellar track record when it comes to making easy-to-use services.
Products such as iCloud, iTunes, and Siri lack the intuitive polish of Apple’s devices, and customers aren’t likely to be as forgiving when the stakes are raised from organizing photos to ensuring the security of their financial transactions.
The new iPhones use a technology called near field communication that employs a short-range wireless signal to transmit data from the handset to a store’s payment terminal.
Software keeps a person’s credit card information inside the phone and ensures it’s never shared directly with the merchant.
Led by Jennifer Bailey, a vice president who had overseen Apple’s online store, the company started pitching this system early last year to banks, credit card companies, and retailers as more secure, more intuitive, and, unlike previous mobile payment systems, more likely to actually be used by tens of millions of iPhone owners.
As a result, Apple signed up the largest banks, credit card companies, and national chains such as McDonald’s   MCD   and Walgreen   WAG  .
They set out to do something from Day One with substantial scale,” says James Anderson, MasterCard’s   MA   senior vice president for mobile and emerging payments.
Cook’s culture hasn’t suited everybody.
To one former senior designer, accustomed to spitballing sessions with Jobs to go over details as minute as the look of screen icons, the company no longer has the same allure.
He says he left because Apple grew too large and that products once created in small groups are now done in sprawling teams.
Others chafe at Cook’s insistence on financial discipline; in meetings once devoted to the hallowed act of reviewing products, he asks managers pointed questions about spending and hiring projections, says a person involved.
Staff from finance and operations now sit alongside engineers and designers in product road map sessions with key component partners.
Excuse my September allergies,” says Jony Ive, rubbing his nose as he settles into a black leather seat in Apple’s executive offices.
Ive has become a design legend over the past 15 years, having overseen the look and feel of the original iPod  2001 , iPhone  2007 , and iPad  2010 .
His very name—three syllables, no unnecessary letters—fits his minimalist aesthetic.
He has the delicate voice and precise diction you’d expect, but he’s thickly built, and in suede chukka boots, loose-fitting blue-and-white-striped painter’s pants, and blue T-shirt with glasses hanging from his neck, the world’s most famous designer could easily be mistaken for the guy who fixes your sink.
With an Apple Watch wrapped around his hand brass-knuckle style, Ive reveals that the project was conceived in his lab three years ago, shortly after Jobs’s death and before “wearables” became a buzzword in Silicon Valley.
It’s probably one of the most difficult projects I have ever worked on,” he says.
There are numerous reasons for this—the complexity of the engineering, the need for new physical interactions between the watch and the human body—but the one most pertinent to Ive is that the Apple Watch is the first Apple product that looks more like the past than the future.
The company invited a series of watch historians to Cupertino to speak, including French author Dominique Fléchon, an expert in antique timepieces.
Fléchon says only that the “discussion included the philosophy of instruments for measuring time” and notes that the Apple Watch may not be as timeless as some classic Swiss watches: “The evolution of the technologies will render very quickly the Apple Watch obsolete,” he says.
Ive, 47, immersed himself in horological history.
Clocks first popped up on top of towers in the center of towns and over time were gradually miniaturized, appearing on belt buckles, as neck pendants, and inside trouser pockets.
They eventually migrated to the wrist, first as a way for ship captains to tell time while keeping their hands firmly locked on the wheel.
What was interesting is that it took centuries to find the wrist and then it didn’t go anywhere else,” Ive says.
Ive’s team first tried using the same pinch-to-zoom touchscreen they’d invented for the iPhone, but the screen was too small and their fingers obscured the display.
A year into the project, the group started toying with what became the Apple Watch’s defining physical feature: “the digital crown,” a variation on the knob that’s used to wind and set the time on a traditional wristwatch.
By pressing or rotating the crown, Apple Watch users can return to the home screen, zoom in or out, and scroll through apps.
Watches are as much about fashion as functionality.
Ive and his colleagues indulged their obsession for detail and designed three collections of devices made of different materials and seven watchbands with their own features and flourishes.
Ive handles each of the watches with the proud familiarity of a father, demonstrating, for example, how links can be plucked off a stainless steel band by pressing two buttons, no specialized jeweler’s tool required.
In another bit of engineering cleverness, the watch’s packaging doubles as a charging stand; wearers nestle the watch against an inductive magnet inside the watch box to recharge it.
How often they’ll have to recharge remains unknown.
By last summer, with Apple’s stock down by as much as 40 percent from a record high because of concerns about the lack of new products, Cook was ready to accelerate the project.
Apple insiders say that while an executive named Dan Riccio, who leads hardware engineering, would have been the obvious choice to take over the Watch program, Cook assigned it to Jeff Williams, 51, senior vice president for operations.
Williams is Cook’s go-to guy—he vets possible acquisitions, coordinates with Foxconn Technology   2354:TT   and other manufacturers, and oversees the logistics needed to get millions of devices from Asian factories to stores around the world.
He’s an uncanny Cook clone: tall, soft-spoken, and an avid fitness buff with an inexhaustible memory for operational details.
Both men have MBAs from Duke University and spent early parts of their careers at IBM   IBM  .
In the new Apple, he’s Tim Cook’s Tim Cook.
Williams took over a team that had little in common with the small groups that created the Macintosh and iPhone, which considered themselves renegades operating in secrecy from other colleagues.
The watch team included hundreds of engineers, designers, and marketing people and was the kind of cross-company interdisciplinary team now common under Cook.
Apple, which has more than 1,000 chip designers, built the new S1 processor that powers the watch.
Metallurgists responsible for the casing for Macs and iPhones devised a stronger gold alloy for the premium model of the watch, and Apple’s algorithm scientists studied how to improve the accuracy of the watch’s heart rate sensor.
Williams is unapologetic about the Apple Watch missing the 2014 holiday season.
We want to make the best product in the world,” he says.
Cook also preaches patience.
We could have done the watch much earlier, honestly, but not at the fit and finish and quality and integration of these products,” he says.
Critics of Apple—they do exist—say the watch’s user interface is confusing and that it’s not entirely clear whether there’s a “killer app” or what, if anything, the watch does better than a smartphone.
Prices start at $349, which is more than most users will pay for an iPhone 6 with a two-year contract.
Photograph by Geordie Wood for Bloomberg BusinessweekCook says he wishes he could make the device more affordable, particularly since the company boasts of its potential to help customers manage their health and wellness  “that’s the humanitarian coming out” , but he won’t compromise Apple’s large profit margins to make it happen.
Then there are fashion considerations.
Some men will find it to be a little too feminine and some women will find it too bulky and possibly too masculine,” says Gadi Amit, president of the San Francisco firm NewDealDesign.
At Apple’s March shareholder meeting, a representative from the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research questioned Cook on Apple’s commitment to making its factories carbon neutral and removing harmful chemicals from its products.
What was the return on investment?
Cook showed an uncharacteristic flash of real anger.
I don’t consider the bloody ROI,” he said.
The crowd erupted into raucous applause.
Last year Cook hired Lisa Jackson, the former director of the Environmental Protection Agency, to lead Apple’s environmental initiatives.
And he hasn’t met an in-house environmental impact video he hasn’t lovingly embraced, narrating them personally in his Alabama baritone.
Jobs sometimes gestured toward caring about stuff like Apple’s climate impact, too—when he wasn’t dismissing it as “bulls-‍-‍-,” as he did in 2005 in response to criticism that the company didn’t do enough to limit the chemicals in its products or make them more recyclable.
One of Cook’s mantras is that Apple should “default to open” on issues of corporate responsibility and engage on causes that are important to customers.
In the old Apple, “it was the ‘just be quiet, just say nothing, only talk about things that are completed,’” Cook says.
My view is that that doesn’t work in things involving social responsibility.
Alas, that transparency stops at Apple’s product plans.
In August, Apple released its internal diversity report.
Its employment numbers were lopsided toward white and Asian men.
There was a view we shouldn’t” release the report, Cook says.
I didn’t agree.
It clearly says we’re not a perfect company, and we have work to do.
The company continues to struggle with conditions at its factories in China, with an internal audit this year documenting use of underage laborers and abuse of migrant workers.
There’s another kind of openness at Apple as well.
Cook is more willing to acknowledge weaknesses in its business and, when necessary, seek outside partnerships to boost demand for products.
In July the company linked up with IBM, its original arch nemesis, to sell iPads and iPhones to large companies and develop industry-specific productivity apps.
The deal was an acknowledgment that Apple needs to find new ways to sell its devices, particularly the iPad, which accounted for 20 percent of its sales last year and has hit a surprising slump in recent quarters.
Ginni Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, calls Cook the “hallmark of a modern-day CEO.
Cook had decided that Apple needed more corporate customers but didn’t want to add the requisite army of buttoned-up salespeople.
So he found a partner.
Cook says the IBM venture is the perfect deal, because it plays to both companies’ strengths and there’s little competitive overlap.
I don’t want 100,000 people that do consulting,” he says.
And an IBM smartwatch?
You wouldn’t want to see it.
It would be awful,” Cook says.
Apple learned to play well with others the hard way—from working with hundreds of wireless carriers such as AT&T over the last few years.
Apple’s carrier partners are a little like younger brothers: congenitally put upon, thoroughly dominated, but ultimately along for a tremendous ride.
The carriers say Apple under Cook can still be imposing and secretive, though now there’s more of a personal touch.
Tim’s a tough negotiator,” says Glenn Lurie, CEO of AT&T Mobility, who’s been working with Cook since before the release of the iPhone in 2007.
Apple is also more willing to seek another kind of outside help.
Over the last few months, the company’s gone on a hiring spree, vacuuming up accomplished tastemakers such as Patrick Pruniaux, the chief salesman at watchmaker Tag Heuer; Paul Deneve, the former CEO of couture house Yves Saint Laurent; and Angela Ahrendts, Burberry’s   BRBY:LN   former chief executive, who joined Apple to run its stores.
The recruitment spree isn’t only about finding people who know how to sell watches at extravagant markups, but also about adding a diversity of views inside the company.
Cook “is very focused on finding a very wide range of people,” says Susan Wagner, founding partner and director of asset-management firm BlackRock   BLK  , Apple’s largest shareholder, who joined the company’s board earlier this summer.
It’s not automatically the way you think about diversity.
Cook “is comfortable enough to say ‘we need help here,’ and then he goes out and gets it,” says Jimmy Iovine, who became a part of the talent wave, along with Dr.
Dre, the hip-hop impresario, when Apple acquired their company, Beats Electronics, in May for $3 billion, the biggest acquisition in the company’s history.
In Beats, Apple got a business in fashionable  some might say overpriced  headphones and wireless speakers that brought in more than a billion dollars in revenue last year.
Yet Cook says he bought the company for another reason—to enlist its brokers of cool to help Apple reestablish its core franchise in digital music amid the decline of single track downloads on iTunes and the rise of streaming music services such as Pandora   P  .
The recording industry desperately needs a delivery system that is as compelling as the music,” says Iovine, nestled among celebrities and journalists after Apple’s product introduction in the blindingly white demo hall that the company constructed next to the Flint Center.
As he speaks, Gwen Stefani is trying to get his attention, but Iovine doesn’t notice.
He’s engrossed in describing his new colleagues’ quest to sell high-fashion, high-tech merchandise.
These guys don’t want to just hire it,” he says.
They want to understand it.
They want our input.
Cook concedes that consumers will issue the ultimate verdict on the Apple Watch, his biggest bet so far as chief executive.
You don’t really know on that first day or first weekend,” he says.
If consumers are befuddled or ambivalent, the questions about his product chops, and Apple’s ability to innovate, will return with a new ferocity.
He’s also likely to face challenges retaining Apple’s top talent.
Longtime execs such as Philip Schiller, the marketing chief, and Eddy Cue, who runs iTunes and the App Store, are worth hundreds of millions and could easily retire to spend more time with their car collections.
Ive owns Jobs’s 15-seat Gulfstream jet, which he bought from Jobs’s widow at a significant discount, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.
Some former Apple executives think Ive could be inching toward the door and interpret the recent hiring of celebrity designer Marc Newson , Ive’s friend, as evidence he may be staying put for now.
An Apple spokeswoman declines to comment on Ive’s plans, and Schiller says the team is staying together.
A lot of us at Apple are here because we love the products,” he says.
For now Cook is just trying to capitalize on the attention and enjoy the moment he worked the past three years for.
Backstage at the Flint Center before the Sept.
9 event, he could be found with his white earbuds on, psyching himself up by listening to the OneRepublic song I Lived on his iPhone.

CNBC s Josh Lipton talks to Apple CEO Tim Cook about his company s new partnership with IBM, which will make busniess apps exclusively for iPads and iPhones.
Tech behemoths Apple and IBM announced a partnership Tuesday that could make Apple—traditionally a consumer brand—a major player in the business market.
IBM said it would create a class of more than 100 business applications exclusively for iPhones and iPads to run on Apple s iOS platform.
In return, IBM will sell Apple s products with 100 industry-specific apps to its clients worldwide.
Some of the services IBM will provide via iOS include device management, security, analytics and mobile integration, they said in a release.
In return, Apple s vaunted AppleCare service would provide support for these applications.
The partnership is about  transforming enterprise,  Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC in an exclusive interview.
The partnership aims to  deliver on the promise of mobile in a big way,  he said.
One priority of the partnership will be one of the  biggest inhibitors  in enterprise, which is security, IBM CEO Virginia Rometty told CNBC.
Security is increasingly important as cyberhacking and surveillance become more ubiquitous concerns.
The news could impact Blackberry , once the industry leader in enterprise mobile, which is aiming to right itself after years of declining profits and fleeing clients.
Ross Gerber, CEO of wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki, in a   Closing Bell   interview.
The partnership is also sure to put more pressure on Microsoft, which is making its own push into cloud and mobile services for enterprise clients.
That software giant is at the first stage of what CEO Satya Nadella recently said will be a transformation away from selling software.
The company also launched a version of its office software for Apple s iPad earlier in the year.

Apple’s public relations  PR  department is probably the best in the world — certainly more impressive at shaping and controlling the discussion of its products than any other technology company.
Before customers get their first chance to see or touch a new Apple product, the company has carefully orchestrated almost every one of its public appearances: controlled leaks and advance briefings for favored writers, an invite-only media debut, and a special early review process for a group of pre-screened, known-positive writers.
Nothing is left to chance, and in the rare case where Apple doesn’t control the initial message, it remedies that by using proxies to deliver carefully crafted, off-the-record responses.
Except for a few big exceptions, such as the memorably off-pitch quotes above, Apple’s “tell them what to believe” PR strategy has worked incredibly well for years.
But it has also created tensions between the company and the people who cover it, as well as within Apple itself.
The company’s long-time head of PR, Katie Cotton, left the company earlier this year as CEO Tim Cook openly sought to make a major change in the way Apple interacted with the press and its customers.
As the hunt for Cotton’s replacement is still in progress, and the depth of Apple’s commitment to change remains unclear, we look today at the techniques Apple has used to quietly manipulate its coverage over the years.

I am fine with Apple being opinionated.
After all, opinions about other products and companies are opinions.
And as we know, the press isn’t neutral about much at all and they often get the facts a little askew.
For example, people complained mightily about Apple maps, but no one seemed to admit that Google maps had its share of errors.
There was no analysis in the press, just cherry-picked examples to highlight that some Apple maps were imperfect while ignoring the limitations of its competitors.
Apple was right to strike back and reveal that all mapping products have errors.
Was there a different error rate?
Maybe.
Who did the analysis?
No one that I ever saw.
Same thing with Antennagate.
Was it a problem?
All I can say is that the iPhone 4 was one of the most successful smartphones ever, and that it was in the market for an incredible 3 years, and I don’t recall anyone I knew with an iphone 4 bitching about call quality any more than that of  any other handset.
So was Apple right to say that it was an overblown issue?
I’d have to say yes, Apple was right, given the realities in the field.
The tech press is quite bad at the analysis of the details.
A faster clock speed makes computers faster, when tech folks know that clock speeds are just part of a system.
And tech folks know that benchmarks are not the end-all in terms of performance.
But the tech press still hasn’t figured that out.
My goodness, you really drank the Kool-aid.
Apple has gotten a free ride for years.
Ask people who work there.
LOL!
The OPPOSITE is closer to the truth.
No company in the world gets shit on by the press more than Apple.
Including this article.
I derive my own opinions and I know the industry.
You can call me a koolaid drinker if it makes you feel better, but you’re doing so based exclusively on your own unfounded biases.
Keep your dream alive, but don’t expect me to follow you down your baseless path.
No excuses!
Just better maps!
Correct the antenna!
They really need to hire someone is straight and honest in action and speech.
Defending fan atic s just makes it worse!
Again, to back up the previous comment, I had a Nexus One and there was never any “multi-touch-gate”, never any fix, or any public apology or acknowledgement by Google or HTC that the phone had hardware broken multitouch.
Someone made an app that proved it.
Crossing two points on the screen resulted in a mirror-like flip of touch point coordinates in the system.
Completely broken, but as always, Google gets a pass while Apple gets pooped on for the anything and everything.
Perhaps it’s because people demand Apple to create perfect experiences while knowing everyone else always comes short, and not demanding that of them.
Great article with amazing details.
Let’s hope more friendly PR now from Apple.
And after reading this full article, one question comes in mind is that Is this article written by 9to5mac or Apple PR team to leak upcoming changes in Apple PR team?
I’m confused.
What is wrong with this statement?
I have no idea where it comes from, I can only imagine it referred to iPad mini w  Retina Display because that product IS INDEED feature for feature identical to iPad Air.
In that way it was indeed appropriately different.
In every other way, it was a functional iPad on the same level as the larger model.
Aka a really good thing.
Not a second class citizen just because it was also smaller.
Thanks for recapping the company’s failures.
Fact is, if you get lost because of Maps, or Siri brings up pizza parlors when you want a phone number, then it’s a failure.
A company can’t say “well, this is better than so-and-so.
What ruins it are the bloggers and sheep who feel the company is above criticism.
Criticism is how products evolve and innovate.
What exactly is wrong with this statement?
Apple has produced many plastic products in its history.
The anti-plastic snobbery isn’t really coming from Apple.
It’s tactics are Nixonian.
Unfortunately,  there is no media willing to stand up to the company.
I’ve often suspected the company had Apple – controlled bloggers.
Including on this website.
They are subhuman.
What Apple does is, unfortunately, not unique.
The fact that it, or any company,  favors reporters and provides quicker access to favored reporters, should be cause for alarm and possibly legislation.
Consumers will often make buying decisions after reading only early reviews.
Since the early reviewers are favorable to the company they are biased and not reliable sources of accurate information.
While I’ve not heard of a quid-pro-quo, it seems conspiratorial in nature.
This was actually a good piece, if you can ignore the not so subtle anti-Apple vitriol.
The anecdote about the Reuters article on accessibility was a perfect example.
I read that story and the Tim Cook quote was surgically edited to completely change its meaning and tone.
Apple wanted to change the narrative, and rightly so.
The story was an entirely misleading hack job.
I’m not surprised that Apple has a sophisticated PR team that helps get their message out, What company their size doesn’t?
But nothing described in Gurman’s story seems unethical or improper to me in any way.
If anything, it sounds like the writer is chronically butt hurt that he’s not in Apple’s “inside circle” – a notion that is evident in virtually every Apple-related tweet.
I think in the end, Steve Jobs–while he was a master salesman and in many ways a visionary–started to hurt Apple because his arrogant attitude on product design turned off a lot of people.
And it really didn’t help when Jobs wanted to aggressively go after Google over Android back in 2010.
Today, it appears that Apple has finally begun to shed the PR problems that Jobs caused.
Note that Apple has really dialed down its legal cases against Android  with the exception of Samsung–but then, Samsung’s early touchscreen phones built between 2008 and 2010 as a response to the iPhone blatantly copied the iPhone in too many ways , and I really do believe that there may be an “behind the scenes” attempt by Apple and Google to settle the dispute once and for all–with an resolution coming in  my guess  early 2015.
My favorite anti-Apple rant was the MacBook Pro heat sink compound fiasco.
Apple used a lot of heat sink compound in the pro and it squished about.
Some blogger in the press opened up his MBP and saw it.
OMG this will prevent heat dissipation due to sloppy assembly!
Of course any physicist will tell you that’s dumb, but next thing you know the press was reporting the situation as a problem as if it made sense.
People with thermal probes thought they proved there was a problem, again showing the failings of high school physics.
Apple was called to fix it, and the blogosphere was fired up.
Of course, heat sink compound is an excellent conductor of heat and resulted in more surface area.
Warmer air coming out of the MBP was because more heat was being ejected from the MBP.
Which is exactly what the cooling system was designed to do.
Press research?
None.
Press follow up once the truth became clear?
None.
Readers sent down the wrong path due to misinformation?
Countless.
Because saying you’re wrong doesn’t produce ad clicks.
I want to read more about what happened in details.
Guess you weren’t around in 2007 when they released this phone called the iPhone.
It was amazing and today, every phone made basically follows it’s pattern.
They also did a born-again on the tablet concept, and released this thing called an iPad in 2010, which set the design and bar for every tablet made today, now there are dozens of companies making hundreds of models, whereas before the iPad, there were none.
Also around that time, they invented a laptop category called the “ultrabook”, which was a super thin, low power consumption, super light type of laptop which used SSD chips for storage and had no moving internal parts besides the cooling fan.
It forced the other computer manufacturers to catch up and make ultrabooks too, which became extremely popular.
You really should get out from under that rock and get some fresh air, it’s not healthy living down there man.
Seriously, interesting article-the part I will recall is simply: Apple is currently refreshing its PR department.
But I feel that the big picture of why Apple is so successful with PR is missing in your article: you name all the elements but don’t mention why it all works together, or what makes it different from the competition.
Seriously, does anyone think that Google does not spend time preparing its I O conference in advance too or trying to influence news articles?
Lol.
I feel frustrated reading your article because many things described look like any other company’s PR department, but you present it in a way that suggests that there’s something extraordinary just because it’s Apple.
Maybe it’s me.
An example of what I mean: using “Tyrant” as a headline for Cathie Cotton seems unfair to me.
While she might very well be a tyrant, her job is not to be nice, but to make people talk about Apple, and she managed in such a way that even writing an article about Apple’s own PR can create buzz!

Apple’s public relations  PR  department is probably the best in the world — certainly more impressive at shaping and controlling the discussion of its products than any other technology company.
Before customers get their first chance to see or touch a new Apple product, the company has carefully orchestrated almost every one of its public appearances: controlled leaks and advance briefings for favored writers, an invite-only media debut, and a special early review process for a group of pre-screened, known-positive writers.
Nothing is left to chance, and in the rare case where Apple doesn’t control the initial message, it remedies that by using proxies to deliver carefully crafted, off-the-record responses.
Except for a few big exceptions, such as the memorably off-pitch quotes above, Apple’s “tell them what to believe” PR strategy has worked incredibly well for years.
But it has also created tensions between the company and the people who cover it, as well as within Apple itself.
The company’s long-time head of PR, Katie Cotton, left the company earlier this year as CEO Tim Cook openly sought to make a major change in the way Apple interacted with the press and its customers.
As the hunt for Cotton’s replacement is still in progress, and the depth of Apple’s commitment to change remains unclear, we look today at the techniques Apple has used to quietly manipulate its coverage over the years.

I am fine with Apple being opinionated.
After all, opinions about other products and companies are opinions.
And as we know, the press isn’t neutral about much at all and they often get the facts a little askew.
For example, people complained mightily about Apple maps, but no one seemed to admit that Google maps had its share of errors.
There was no analysis in the press, just cherry-picked examples to highlight that some Apple maps were imperfect while ignoring the limitations of its competitors.
Apple was right to strike back and reveal that all mapping products have errors.
Was there a different error rate?
Maybe.
Who did the analysis?
No one that I ever saw.
Same thing with Antennagate.
Was it a problem?
All I can say is that the iPhone 4 was one of the most successful smartphones ever, and that it was in the market for an incredible 3 years, and I don’t recall anyone I knew with an iphone 4 bitching about call quality any more than that of  any other handset.
So was Apple right to say that it was an overblown issue?
I’d have to say yes, Apple was right, given the realities in the field.
The tech press is quite bad at the analysis of the details.

In one of the clearest signs that Apple is — and has been — working on a smartwatch device, the Cupertino company was on Tuesday granted a patent for a wrist-worn wearable with augmented strap capabilities, support for arm and wrist gestures, advanced proximity-sensing circuitry and much more.
S.
S.
Patent No.
8,787,006 for a  Wrist-worn electronic device and methods therefor  describes a device  dubbed  iTime  in one illustration  that fits squarely with speculation regarding a so-called   iWatch   smartwatch.
The invention s main claims, as the title implies, revolve around a wrist-worn device that can connect with other portables like iPhones and iPads, computers, or even the watch s straps, which integrate sensors and other circuitry to augment device performance.
Basically, a majority of the property details what can be considered a  smart wristband  that features a receptacle for a portable media player.
What comes later in the patent, however, potentially reveals Apple s smartwatch aspirations.
As noted, much of the invention pertains to a convertible style smartwatch that incorporates a central electronic device removably secured to an advanced strap strap system.
The idea harkens back to the days of Apple s sixth-generation iPod nano, which spawned a cottage industry for ad-hoc solutions that turned the media player into a wristwatch-style device.
In fact, Apple s patent background alludes to the iPod nano by name.
Operationally, the system is based on the idea of converting the square-shaped iPod nano into a smartwatch.
Initial claims note the media player can be inserted into specially-made straps that integrate various electrical components to augment the device s capabilities.
The document mentions parts like accelerometers, GPS modules, wireless communication packages and haptic feedback mechanisms as potential candidates for inclusion in the advanced strap structure.
Things start to get interesting when Apple describes what it calls a  personal wireless environment.  In essence, the invention illustrates an ecosystem in which the electronic wristwatch can interact with nearby devices like an iPhone, laptop or desktop computer.
Apple goes on to detail how this  piconet  works.
Through either wired or wireless communication protocols, the wristwatch can operatively connect to a cellular or Internet-connected device.
In this way, information can be exchanged from iPhone to watch, or watch to iPhone, either automatically or at a user s request.
In one embodiment, the watch is able to receive a notification initiated by a nearby phone, then alert the user to the event through audio, visual or haptic feedback  vibrations .
Once alerted, the user has the option to take out their iPhone or dive into the notification directly on the watch, whether it be onscreen or through audio output like system speakers or headphones.
Various embodiments allow for incoming phone calls, text messages, social and news network feeds, among other information, to be displayed on the wristband s display.
Apps can tap into the functionality and provide their own notifications, assumedly through iOS APIs.
Data is  pushed  to the wearable dynamically, but more importantly users are able to handle the information directly by interacting with the source device.
For example, the wristwatch provides controls for a media player, while other options include control over apps or system-level functions.
Apple is describing a wristband-based remote input output interface with high-level controls for a mobile phone, otherwise known as a smartwatch.
The patent goes further, noting the wristband can also be linked to an iPhone in order to alert the user when it is left behind, stolen or out of range.
0, which supports proximity-based operations.
The remainder of Apple s patent looks at physical embodiments of the invention, many of which deal with connecting and securing a portable media player like the aforementioned iPod nano.
There is, however, a key embodiment that does not require any additional devices.
As illustrated in the image above, all components can be incorporated into a single enclosure, complete with display, sensors, circuitry and I O controls.
Specifically, electronics available for integration in either the smartwatch core unit or surrounding strap structure include haptic mechanisms, various sensors, biometric components, GPS modules, NFC antennas, Bluetooth packages, proximity detectors and more.
Finally, tacked on to the end of the document is a contingency for arm and wrist gestures.
Instead of controlling the smartwatch via fingers, users would be able to shake, bounce, tap or otherwise interact with the device through physical movements.
Gesture combinations can be assigned to certain device controls.
For example, an incoming call may be answered by a single wrist shake, or declined with two shakes and a tap.
Apple is widely expected to introduce an  iWatch  device with functionality very similar to that described in the patent above.
Previously the stuff of rumors, evidence that the connected device exists is quickly mounting.
5-inch OLED display and could come in three sizes .
The device is also said to have a heavy focus on health and wellness, with possible fitness tracking functions built-in.
While a specific launch date — and the product itself — has yet to be revealed, noted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo forecasts iWatch production to begin in November ahead of a December or early 2015 rollout.
Apple s comprehensive  iTime  smartwatch patent was first filed for in 2011 and credits Albert J.

He just had his digital life dissolved by hackers.
Photo: Ariel Zambelich Wired.
In the space of one hour, my entire digital life was destroyed.
First my Google account was taken over, then deleted.
Next my Twitter account was compromised, and used as a platform to broadcast racist and homophobic messages.
And worst of all, my AppleID account was broken into, and my hackers used it to remotely erase all of the data on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.
In many ways, this was all my fault.
My accounts were daisy-chained together.
Getting into Amazon let my hackers get into my Apple ID account, which helped them get into Gmail, which gave them access to Twitter.
Had I used two-factor authentication for my Google account, it’s possible that none of this would have happened, because their ultimate goal was always to take over my Twitter account and wreak havoc.
Lulz.
Had I been regularly backing up the data on my MacBook, I wouldn’t have had to worry about losing more than a year’s worth of photos, covering the entire lifespan of my daughter, or documents and e-mails that I had stored in no other location.
Those security lapses are my fault, and I deeply, deeply regret them.
But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Apple’s and Amazon’s.
Apple tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account.
Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information — a partial credit card number — that Apple used to release information.
In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification.
The disconnect exposes flaws in data management policies endemic to the entire technology industry, and points to a looming nightmare as we enter the era of cloud computing and connected devices.
This isn’t just my problem.
Since Friday, Aug.
3, when hackers broke into my accounts, I’ve heard from other users who were compromised in the same way, at least one of whom was targeted by the same group.
Moreover, if your computers aren’t already cloud-connected devices, they will be soon.
Apple is working hard to get all of its customers to use iCloud.
Google’s entire operating system is cloud-based.
And Windows 8, the most cloud-centric operating system yet, will hit desktops by the tens of millions in the coming year.
My experience leads me to believe that cloud-based systems need fundamentally different security measures.
Password-based security mechanisms — which can be cracked, reset, and socially engineered — no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing.
Friday.
I was playing with my daughter when my iPhone suddenly powered down.
I was expecting a call, so I went to plug it back in.
It then rebooted to the setup screen.
This was irritating, but I wasn’t concerned.
I assumed it was a software glitch.
And, my phone automatically backs up every night.
I just assumed it would be a pain in the ass, and nothing more.
I entered my iCloud login to restore, and it wasn’t accepted.
I went to connect the iPhone to my computer and restore from that backup — which I had just happened to do the other day.
When I opened my laptop, an iCal message popped up telling me that my Gmail account information was wrong.
Then the screen went gray, and asked for a four-digit PIN.
By now, I knew something was very, very wrong.
For the first time it occurred to me that I was being hacked.
Unsure of exactly what was happening, I unplugged my router and cable modem, turned off the Mac Mini we use as an entertainment center, grabbed my wife’s phone, and called AppleCare, the company’s tech support service, and spoke with a rep for the next hour and a half.
It wasn’t the first call they had had that day about my account.
In fact, I later found out that a call had been placed just a little more than a half an hour before my own.
But the Apple rep didn’t bother to tell me about the first call concerning my account, despite the 90 minutes I spent on the phone with tech support.
Nor would Apple tech support ever tell me about the first call voluntarily — it only shared this information after I asked about it.
And I only knew about the first call because a hacker told me he had made the call himself.
Apple’s tech support records, someone called AppleCare claiming to be me.
In response, Apple issued a temporary password.
It did this despite the caller’s inability to answer security questions I had set up.
And it did this after the hacker supplied only two pieces of information that anyone with an internet connection and a phone can discover.
But even if I did, I might not have noticed the message because the hackers immediately sent it to the trash.
They then were able to follow the link in that e-mail to permanently reset my AppleID password.
Twitter password.
At 5:00 they used iCloud’s “Find My” tool to remotely wipe my iPhone.
At 5:01 they remotely wiped my iPad.
At 5:05 they remotely wiped my MacBook.
Around this same time, they deleted my Google account.
At 5:10, I placed the call to AppleCare.
At 5:12 the attackers posted a message to my account on Twitter taking credit for the hack.
By wiping my MacBook and deleting my Google account, they now not only had the ability to control my account, but were able to prevent me from regaining access.
And crazily, in ways that I don’t and never will understand, those deletions were just collateral damage.
My MacBook data — including those irreplaceable pictures of my family, of my child’s first year and relatives who have now passed from this life — weren’t the target.
Nor were the eight years of messages in my Gmail account.
The target was always Twitter.
My MacBook data was torched simply to prevent me from getting back in.
Lulz.
I spent an hour and a half talking to AppleCare.
One of the reasons it took me so long to get anything resolved with Apple during my initial phone call was because I couldn’t answer the security questions it had on file for me.
It turned out there’s a good reason for that.
Perhaps an hour or so into the call, the Apple representative on the line said “Mr.
Wait.
Mr.
Apple had been looking at the wrong account all along.
Because of that, I couldn’t answer my security questions.
It turns out, a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card number are the only two pieces of information anyone needs to get into your iCloud account.
Once supplied, Apple will issue a temporary password, and that password grants access to iCloud.
Apple tech support confirmed to me twice over the weekend that all you need to access someone’s AppleID is the associated e-mail address, a credit card number, the billing address, and the last four digits of a credit card on file.
I was very clear about this.
During my second tech support call to AppleCare, the representative confirmed this to me.
That’s really all you have to have to verify something with us,” he said.
We talked to Apple directly about its security policy, and company spokesperson Natalie Kerris told Wired, “Apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password.
In this particular case, the customer’s data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer.
In addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely.
On Monday, Wired tried to verify the hackers’ access technique by performing it on a different account.
We were successful.
This means, ultimately, all you need in addition to someone’s e-mail address are those two easily acquired pieces of information: a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card on file.
Here’s the story of how the hackers got them.
By exploiting the customer service procedures employed by Apple and Amazon, hackers were able to get into iCloud and take over all of Mat Honan’s digital devices — and data.
On the night of the hack, I tried to make sense of the ruin that was my digital life.
My Google account was nuked, my Twitter account was suspended, my phone was in a useless state of restore, and  for obvious reasons  I was highly paranoid about using my Apple email account for communication.
I decided to set up a new Twitter account until my old one could be restored, just to let people know what was happening.
I logged into Tumblr and posted an account of how I thought the takedown occurred.
At this point, I was assuming that my seven-digit alphanumeric AppleID password had been hacked by brute force.
In the comments   and, oh, the comments   others guessed that hackers had used some sort of keystroke logger.
At the end of the post, I linked to my new Twitter account.
And then, one of my hackers @ messaged me.
He would later identify himself as Phobia.
I followed him.
He followed me back.
We started a dialogue via Twitter direct messaging that later continued via e-mail and AIM.
Phobia was able to reveal enough detail about the hack and my compromised accounts that it became clear he was, at the very least, a party to how it went down.
I agreed not to press charges, and in return he laid out exactly how the hack worked.
I asked him why.
Was I targeted specifically?
Was this just to get to Gizmodo’s Twitter account ?
No, Phobia said they hadn’t even been aware that my account was linked to Gizmodo’s, that the Gizmodo linkage was just gravy.
He said the hack was simply a grab for my three-character Twitter handle.
That’s all they wanted.
They just wanted to take it, and fuck shit up, and watch it burn.
It wasn’t personal.
I honestly didn’t have any heat towards you before this.
I said before” he told me via Twitter Direct Message.
After coming across my account, the hackers did some background research.
My Twitter account linked to my personal website, where they found my Gmail address.
Guessing that this was also the e-mail address I used for Twitter, Phobia went to Google’s account recovery page.
He didn’t even have to actually attempt a recovery.
This was just a recon mission.
Because I didn’t have Google’s two-factor authentication turned on, when Phobia entered my Gmail address, he could view the alternate e-mail I had set up for account recovery.
Jackpot.
This was how the hack progressed.
If I had some other account aside from an Apple e-mail address, or had used two-factor authentication for Gmail, everything would have stopped here.
I had an AppleID account, which meant I was vulnerable to being hacked.
Be careful with your Amazon account — or someone might buy merchandise on your credit card, but send it to their home.
You honestly can get into any email associated with apple,” Phobia claimed in an e-mail.
And while it’s work, that seems to be largely true.
Since he already had the e-mail, all he needed was my billing address and the last four digits of my credit card number to have Apple’s tech support issue him the keys to my account.
So how did he get this vital information?
He began with the easy one.
He got the billing address by doing a whois search on my personal web domain.
If someone doesn’t have a domain, you can also look up his or her information on Spokeo, WhitePages, and PeopleSmart.
Getting a credit card number is tricker, but it also relies on taking advantage of a company’s back-end systems.
Phobia says that a partner performed this part of the hack, but described the technique to us, which we were able to verify via our own tech support phone calls.
It’s remarkably easy — so easy that Wired was able to duplicate the exploit twice in minutes.
First you call Amazon and tell them you are the account holder, and want to add a credit card number to the account.
All you need is the name on the account, an associated e-mail address, and the billing address.
Amazon then allows you to input a new credit card.
Then you hang up.
Next you call back, and tell Amazon that you’ve lost access to your account.
Upon providing a name, billing address, and the new credit card number you gave the company on the prior call, Amazon will allow you to add a new e-mail address to the account.
From here, you go to the Amazon website, and send a password reset to the new e-mail account.
This allows you to see all the credit cards on file for the account — not the complete numbers, just the last four digits.
But, as we know, Apple only needs those last four digits.
We asked Amazon to comment on its security policy, but didn’t have anything to share by press time.
And it’s also worth noting that one wouldn’t have to call Amazon to pull this off.
Your pizza guy could do the same thing, for example.
If you have an AppleID, every time you call Pizza Hut, you’ve giving the 16-year-old on the other end of the line all he needs to take over your entire digital life.
And so, with my name, address, and the last four digits of my credit card number in hand, Phobia called AppleCare, and my digital life was laid waste.
Yet still I was actually quite fortunate.
They could have used my e-mail accounts to gain access to my online banking, or financial services.
They could have used them to contact other people, and socially engineer them as well.
They could have been victimized too.
Instead, the hackers just wanted to embarrass me, have some fun at my expense, and enrage my followers on Twitter by trolling.
I had done some pretty stupid things.
Things you shouldn’t do.
I should have been regularly backing up my MacBook.
Because I wasn’t doing that, if all the photos from the first year and a half of my daughter’s life are ultimately lost, I will have only myself to blame.
I shouldn’t have daisy-chained two such vital accounts — my Google and my iCloud account — together.
And I should have had a recovery address that’s only used for recovery without being tied to core services.
But, mostly, I shouldn’t have used Find My Mac.
Find My iPhone has been a brilliant Apple service.
If you lose your iPhone, or have it stolen, the service lets you see where it is on a map.
The New York Times’ David Pogue recovered his lost iPhone just last week thanks to the service.
And so, when Apple introduced Find My Mac in the update to its Lion operating system last year, I added that to my iCloud options too.
After all, as a reporter, often on the go, my laptop is my most important tool.
But as a friend pointed out to me, while that service makes sense for phones  which are quite likely to be lost  it makes less sense for computers.
You are almost certainly more likely to have your computer accessed remotely than physically.
And even worse is the way Find My Mac is implemented.
When you perform a remote hard drive wipe on Find my Mac, the system asks you to create a four-digit PIN so that the process can be reversed.
But here’s the thing: If someone else performs that wipe — someone who gained access to your iCloud account through malicious means — there’s no way for you to enter that PIN.
A better way to have this set up would be to require a second method of authentication when Find My Mac is initially set up.
If this were the case, someone who was able to get into an iCloud account wouldn’t be able to remotely wipe devices with malicious intent.
It would also mean that you could potentially have a way to stop a remote wipe in progress.
But that’s not how it works.
And Apple would not comment as to whether stronger authentification is being considered.
As of Monday, both of these exploits used by the hackers were still functioning.
Wired was able to duplicate them.
Apple says its internal tech support processes weren’t followed, and this is how my account was compromised.
However, this contradicts what AppleCare told me twice that weekend.
If that is, in fact, the case — that I was the victim of Apple not following its own internal processes — then the problem is widespread.
I asked Phobia why he did this to me.
His answer wasn’t satisfying.
He says he likes to publicize security exploits, so companies will fix them.
He says it’s the same reason he told me how it was done.
He claims his partner in the attack was the person who wiped my MacBook.
Phobia expressed remorse for this, and says he would have stopped it had he known.
AIM.
I asked specifically about the photos of my little girl, which are, to me, the greatest tragedy in all this.
Unless I can recover those photos via data recovery services, they are gone forever.
On AIM, I asked him if he was sorry for doing that.
Phobia replied, “even though i wasnt the one that did it i feel sorry about that.
But let’s say he did know, and failed to stop it.
Hell, for the sake of argument, let’s say he did it.
Let’s say he pulled the trigger.
The weird thing is, I’m not even especially angry at Phobia, or his partner in the attack.
I’m mostly mad at myself.
I’m mad as hell for not backing up my data.
I’m sad, and shocked, and feel that I am ultimately to blame for that loss.
But I’m also upset that this ecosystem that I’ve placed so much of my trust in has let me down so thoroughly.
I’m angry that Amazon makes it so remarkably easy to allow someone into your account, which has obvious financial consequences.
And then there’s Apple.
I bought into the Apple account system originally to buy songs at 99 cents a pop, and over the years that same ID has evolved into a single point of entry that controls my phones, tablets, computers and data-driven life.
With this AppleID, someone can make thousands of dollars of purchases in an instant, or do damage at a cost that you can’t put a price on.

What s life really like designing for Apple?
An alum shares what he learned during his seven years in Cupertino.
Apple is synonymous with upper echelon design, but very little is known about the company s design process.
Most of Apple s own employees aren t allowed inside Apple s fabled design studios.
So we re left piecing together interviews , or outright speculating about how Apple does it and what it s really like to be a designer at the company.
Happy Labor Day!
We re taking the day off to fry at the beach and catch up on our Pädagogisches Skizzenbuch .
Eds.
Enter Mark Kawano .
Before founding Storehouse , Kawano was a senior designer at Apple for seven years, where he worked on Aperture and iPhoto.
Later, Kawano became Apple s User Experience Evangelist, guiding third-party app iOS developers to create software that felt right on Apple s platforms.
Kawano was with the company during a critical moment, as Apple released the iPhone and created the wide world of apps.
Design, Kawano spoke frankly about his time at Apple--and especially wanted to address all the myths the industry has about the company and about its people.
I think the biggest misconception is this belief that the reason Apple products turn out to be designed better, and have a better user experience, or are sexier, or whatever .
Kawano says.
But in his role as user experience evangelist, meeting with design teams from Fortune 500 companies on a daily basis, he absorbed a deeper truth.
It s actually the engineering culture, and the way the organization is structured to appreciate and support design.
Everybody there is thinking about UX and design, not just the designers.
And that s what makes everything about the product so much better .
It has often been said that good design needs to start at the top--that the CEO needs to care about design as much as the designers themselves.
People often observe that Steve Jobs brought this structure to Apple.
But the reason that structure works isn t because of a top-down mandate.
It s an all around mandate.
Everyone cares.
It s not this thing where you get some special wings or superpowers when you enter Cupertino.
It s not this thing where you get some special wings or superpowers when you enter Cupertino.
It s that you now have an organization where you can spend your time designing products, instead of having to fight for your seat at the table, or get frustrated when the better design is passed over by an engineering manager who just wants to optimize for bug fixing.
All of those things are what other designers at other companies have to spend a majority of their time doing.
Kawano underscores that everyone at Apple--from the engineers to the marketers--is, to some extent, thinking like a designer.
In turn, HR hires employees accordingly.
Much like Google hires employees that think like Googlers, Apple hires employees that truly take design into consideration in all of their decisions.
You see companies that have poached Apple designers, and they come up with sexy interfaces or something interesting, but it doesn t necessarily move the needle for their business or their product.
That s because all the designer did was work on an interface piece, but to have a really well-designed product in the way Steve would say, this  holistic  thing, is everything.
It s not just the interface piece.
It s designing the right business model into it.
Designing the right marketing and the copy, and the way to distribute it.
Facebook has hundreds of designers.
Google may have 1,000 or more.
But when Kawano was at Apple, its core software products were designed by a relatively small group of roughly 100 people.
Kawano says.
For the most part, Apple didn t employ specialist designers.
Every designer could hold their own in both creating icons and new interfaces, for instance.
And thanks to the fact that Apple hires design-centric engineers, the relatively skeleton design team could rely on engineers to begin the build process on a new app interface, rather than having to initiate their own mock-up first.
Of course, this approach may be changing today.
For Apple, having a small, really focused organization made a lot of sense when Steve was there, because so many ideas came from Steve.
Kawano says.
Notably, Jony Ive, who now heads usability across hardware and software, is reported to have brought in some of the marketing team to help redesign iOS 7 .
It s a coup, when you think about it, for marketers to be deep in the trenches with designers and engineers.
Apple products are often defined by small details, especially those around interaction.
Case in point: When you type a wrong password, the password box shakes in response.
These kinds of details are packed with meaningful delight.
They re moments that seem tough to explain logically but which make sense on a gut level.
It s impossible to come up with innovative things when you have a deadline.
So many companies try to mimic this idea .
X, Y, and Z.
Kawano explains.
The reality?
3-D cube interfaces or bouncy physics-based icons--during a bit of their down time, and then they might sit on them for years before they make sense in a particular context.
But if you re imagining some giant vault of animation ideas hiding inside Apple and waiting to be discovered, you d be wrong.
The reality, Kawano explains, was far more bohemian.
Kawano says.
There was a commonly shared piece of advice inside Apple--maybe you ve heard it before--that a designer should always take the stairs, because if you met Steve Jobs in the elevator, he d ask what you were up to.
1.
He d hate it, and you might be fired.
2.
He d love it, the detail would gain his attention, and you d lose every foreseeable night, weekend, and vacation to the project.
Kawano laughs when he tells it to me, but the conclusion he draws is more nuanced than the obvious Catch 22 punchline.
People who thrived at Apple welcomed that passion from working with Steve.
The reality is, the people who thrived at Apple were the people who welcomed that desire and passion to learn from working with Steve, and just really were dedicated to the customer and the product.
They were willing to give up their weekends and vacation time.
And a lot of the people who complained that it wasn t fair .
That s where, a lot of times, he would get a bad rap, but he just wanted the best thing, and expected everyone else to want that same thing.
He had trouble understanding people who didn t want that same thing and wondered why they d be working for him if that was the case.
I think Steve had a very low tolerance for people who didn t care about stuff.
As for Kawano, did he ever get an amazing piece of advice, or an incredible compliment from Jobs?
He was just super accessible.
I totally tried to get him to cut in front of me, but he d never want do anything like that.
That was interesting too, he was super demanding .
This just in, reality happens and everyone knows it.
I’ll opine on one point here: Google’s “thousands” of designers - is a laughing stalk.
Roboto typeface family, was the most hilarious thing ever uttered and screams ineptitude of both PR team, upper management, or both  because it’s either not true, or if it is true, it’s the stupidest thing ever to happen in human history .
Apple has around a hundred designers?
SAY IT AIN’T SO!
19,000 designers” no, we’re probably reading this blog because we are a designer, and know that it can be one, or ten, or one hundred people working on projectS but it’s ludicras to even fathom design by committee with large numbers.
NOBODY!
The idea that if you don t want to work on weekends or give up your vacation time, you aren t committed enough to your career or company is so insulting and manipulative.
That s the same as saying,  If you want to actually cash your paycheck, use your health benefits or contribute to your 401K you don t care about your job.  Vacation time is part of your compensation package.
It s negotiated before you are hired and your employer agreed to let you have it as a term of your employment.
It s also time we all need to rejuvenate ourselves so we don t get burnt out at our jobs.
Don t ever let a boss like this guy tell you differently.
It absolutely steams me when I hear employers act like you have done something wrong by actually taking the vacation you were promised when you were hired.
There s no rule that says you have to offer paid vacation.
If you don t want your employees taking vacations, just say that.
Don t lie to them and say you offer vacation time because you really don t.
Absolutely agree with you here.
I think if you are an entrepreneur or high level leader then it makes sense to want to give up your vacation time and personal time to your endeavor.
Like for Steve, he sacrificed so much of himself for his company s success.
However if you are an employee you are working for someone else, you should not have this expectation.
You should be expected to work hard, yes, and even dedicate your career.
But by no means should anyone take away the time they were promised for vacation and so on.
We should have a democratic society that affords individuals the ability to succeed in their careers but also spend time with their families or seeking new experiences outside of work.
If you are an employee and not an employer, I think this is only fair.
Question for you, how do you feel about so-called  unlimited vacation  companies?
I get the sense that since there is an undefined number of vacation days, this may also mean  no vacation .
I disagree.
Places with  unlimited vacation,  in theory, are built on the idea of trust.
Trust that you ll get the work done.
You know what?
Sometimes in the real world, you have to work late.
And sometimes, in the real world, you have a family obligation that bleeds into the 9-to-5.
Some years you may  from a financial or workload standpoint  not be able to take a vacation.
Other years, you may be able to go on a two-week holiday in Hawaii.
The trust is, you re going to get your work done.
And everything else balances out in the end.
If more companies started  and followed through  with this trust in their employee relations, retention would not be an issue.
This comment and the above totally miss the point.
This isn t about an expectation from the company that you miss your vacations.
It is about an internal drive to create something spectacular that drives you to work towards that perfection.
You are the driving factor behind missing vacation.
Jobs was like that and so he wanted to surround himself with people like that.
Just like you guys are 9-5ers who just want to do  Only what is expected  and then go home and enjoy other parts of your life.
Which is why you ll probably never be a major part of something like the iPhone or iPad creation.
The title 9-5ers is both insulting and infuriating.
As someone in design industry, I totally understand there is just that moment, you just don t care about everything else but the piece you are working on.
It will be unhealthy, if this obsession becomes too much in my life.
I ve kinda learned myself the art of balancing  being obsessed  and  Don t give a ####  about work, and things in general.
I always find somewhat warm and relieved, when on Apple  Give thanks to everyone and their families  upon new product launch.
They may be the cause of daddies and mammies coming home late, but they are also the ones who understand the values of their sacrifices, with financial compensation.
There are some companies which just don t understand that there is  Sacrifices  behind a great product.
Either they fear of legal obligations or they try hide the great guy, as an anonymous creature that is replaceable a any time.
Great article.
I just finished Jobs bio, and this is a nice addendum.
I think Jobs design centeric engineering was almost autocratic and I wonder if the environment was anything but democratic.
Nobody questioned Steve s vision, and where his tastes aspire from.
I don t know if or do Apple have the best design, I believe they took a very different approach from any other design marketing company, and their products stood out.
Marrying the peculiarity with hype, and yes - the legibility and simplicity worked wonders.
Nokia was equally really good at design, their design had purpose and are truly appealing.
I don t know if they were very sure of the market or succeeded in building the hype around their products.
IMHO, they launched too many products and canabalized on their novelty factor, in which Apple gains huge points.
Design.
Our focus is on highlighting the world’s best examples of design and innovation, working in concert.
We started this site with a few simple premises in mind.
First, design is a window onto the world at large, and the culture we live in.
Designers create objects that meet some unrecognized need.
All businesses strive to do the same thing.
What s New: Broccoli is an excellent source of Chromium ; good sources include barey, oats, green beans, tomatoes and romaine lettuce.
The phytonutrients in apples can help you regulate your blood sugar.
Recent research has shown that apple polyphenols can help prevent spikes in blood sugar through a variety of mechanisms.
Flavonoids like quercetin found in apples can inhibit enzymes like alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase.
Since these enzymes are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simple sugars, your blood sugar has fewer simple sugars to deal with when these enzymes are inhibited.
In addition, the polyphenols in apple have been shown to lessen absorption of glucose from the digestive tract; to stimulate the beta cells of the pancreas to secrete insulin; and to increase uptake of glucose from the blood via stimulation of insulin receptors.
All of these mechanisms triggered by apple polyphenols can make it easier for you to regulate your blood sugar.
Even though apple is not an excellent source of dietary fiber  it ranks as a  good  source in our WHFoods Rating System , the fiber found in apple may combine with other apple nutrients to provide you with the kind of health benefits you would ordinarily only associate with much higher amounts of dietary fiber.
These health benefits are particularly important in prevention of heart disease through healthy regulation of blood fat levels.
Recent research has shown that intake of apples in their whole food form can significantly lower many of our blood fats.
The fat-lowering effects of apple have traditionally been associated with its soluble fiber content, and in particular, with the soluble fiber portion of its polysaccharide component known as pectins.
5 ounces, and that pectins account for less than 50% of this total fiber.
Nevertheless, this relatively modest amount of pectins found in whole apples has now been shown to interact with other apple phytonutrients to give us the kind of blood fat lowering effects that would typically be associated with much higher amounts of soluble fiber intake.
In recent comparisons with laboratory animals, the blood fat lowering effects of whole apple were shown to be greatly reduced when whole apples were eliminated from the diet and replaced by pectins alone.
In summary, it s not fiber alone that explains the cardiovascular benefits of apple, but the interaction of fiber with other phytonutrients in this wonderful fruit.
If you want the full cardiovascular benefits of apples, it s the whole food form that you ll want to choose.
Only this form can provide you with those unique fiber-plus-phytonutrient combinations.
The whole food form of apples is also important if you want full satisfaction from eating them.
Researchers have recently compared intake of whole apples to intake of applesauce and apple juice, only to discover that people report less hunger  and better satiety, or food satisfaction  after eating whole apples than after eating applesauce or drinking apple juice.
But especially interesting was an additional finding about calorie intake following apple consumption.
When healthy adults consumed one medium-sized apple approximately 15 minutes before a meal, their caloric intake at that meal decreased by an average of 15%.
Since meals in this study averaged 1,240 calories, a reduction of 15% meant a reduction of 186 calories, or about 60 more calories than contained in a medium apple.
For these researchers,  getting ahead  in calories with a net reduction of 60 calories was a welcomed outcome of the study, and an extra benefit to their study s primary conclusion—the importance of whole apples  versus other more processed apple forms  in helping us manage our hunger and feeling more satisfied with our food.
Scientists have recently shown that important health benefits of apples may stem from their impact on bacteria in the digestive tract.
In studies on laboratory animals, intake of apples is now known to significantly alter amounts of two bacteria  Clostridiales and Bacteriodes  in the large intestine.
As a result of these bacterial changes, metabolism in the large intestine is also changed, and many of these changes appear to provide health benefits.
For example, due to bacterial changes in the large intestine, there appears to be more fuel available to the large intestine cells  in the form of butyric acid  after apple is consumed.
We expect to see future studies confirming these results in humans, and we are excited to think about potential health benefits of apple that will be related to its impact on bacterial balance in our digestive tract.
Apples belong to the Rose family of plants and are joined in that family by a wide range of very popular foods, including apricots, plums, cherries, peaches, pears, raspberries, and almonds.
Foods in the Rose family are simply too diverse in their nutrient value to allow for any one single recommendation about the number of servings that we should consume from this family on a weekly basis.
However, when focusing specifically on apples, several anti-cancer studies show daily intake of this fruit to provide better anti-cancer benefits than lesser amounts.
So there may be some truth to that old phrase,  An apple a day keeps the doctor away!  Still, we don t recommend that everyone eat one apple on a daily basis, given the wide variety of available fruits and the nutritional uniqueness of each type.
But we do recommend that everyone eat at least 2-3 whole fresh fruits per day, or the equivalent of 2-3 cups  worth of fresh fruit.
Within this framework, if apples are a type of fruit that you strongly prefer, there would be nothing wrong with consuming one on a daily basis, and you may get some special health benefits by doing so.
In the past five years, no area of apple research has been more dynamic than the area of apple polyphenols.
The balance of these phytonutrients in apples is far more unique than many researchers previously suspected.
In terms of flavonols, quercetin is the primary phytonutrient found in apples, and it s far more concentrated in the skin than in the pulp.
Kaempferol and myricetin are also important apple flavonols.
Chlorogenic acid is apple s primary phenolic acid, and it s found throughout the pulp and also in the skin.
If apples are red, it s because of their anthocyanins, which are largely restricted to the skin.
When an apple is more uniformly red in color, or when its red color is deeper in hue, it s because there are more anthocyanins.
In terms of catechin polyphenols, epicatechin is the primary nutrient found in apples.
The flavonoid phloridzin accounts for 98% of the flavonoids found in the apple seeds.
The total polyphenol contents of apples range from about 1-7 grams kilogram of fresh pulp, but this ratio gets much higher in the skin, underscoring the special value of apple skins for deriving optimal polyphenol benefits from this fruit.
In fact, in animal studies, there is a very commonly used standardized apple extract called standardized apple peel polyphenol extract, or APPE.
You might wonder why apples end up with such an amazing array of polyphenols.
In this context, it s fascinating to see that recent research studies show polyphenols to be the favorite mechanism used by apples to protect themselves from UV-B radiation.
Cells in the skin of apple that conduct photosynthesis are especially sensitive to UV-B light from the sun.
Many of the polyphenols in the skin of apples can actually absorb UV-B light, and thereby prevent UV-B from damaging the photosynthetic cells in the apple skin.
Polyphenols, then, are like the apple s natural sunscreen.
It is also interesting to note that the amazing polyphenol content of apples is related to their easy browning when sliced open or bruised.
Inside the cells of apple skin and pulp are enzymes called polyphenol oxidases, or PPOs.
When the cells of the apple are sliced through or physically damaged when an apple is dropped, the PPOs start oxidizing the polyphenols in apples, and the result you see is a browning of the damaged apple portion.
It s important to handle apples delicately in order to protect their health-supportive polyphenols!
Also in this context, it s worth mentioning that damaged apples not only turn brown from the oxidation of their polyphenols, but they also start releasing relatively large amounts of ethylene gas that can pose a risk to other undamaged apples.
Since most of the polyphenols in apples function as antioxidants, it s not surprising to see so many health benefit studies focusing on the antioxidant benefits from apple.
Particularly strong is the ability of apples to decrease oxidation of cell membrane fats.
This benefit is especially important in our cardiovascular system since oxidation of fat  called lipid peroxidation  in the membranes of cells that line our blood vessels is a primary risk factor for clogging of the arteries  atherosclerosis  and other cardiovascular problems.
Apples  strong antioxidant benefits are also related to their ability to lower risk of asthma in numerous studies, and their ability to lower risk of lung cancer.
In addition to their unusual polyphenol composition, apples also provides us with about 8 milligrams of vitamin C.
While that amount is not a lot, it s still important, especially since the recycling of vitamin C in our body depends on the presence of flavonoids and apples do an amazing job of providing us with those flavonoids.
The cardiovascular benefits of apples are well-documented in research studies, and they are closely associated with two aspects of apple nutrients: their water-soluble fiber  pectin  content, and their unusual mix of polyphenols.
Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are both decreased through regular intake of apples.
In some studies,  regular intake  has meant apple intake very close to the level of one whole fresh apple per day.
As mentioned earlier, the strong antioxidant composition of apples provides us with protection from possible oxidation of fats  called lipid peroxidation , including fats found in the bloodstream  like triglycerides  or fats found in the membranes of cells linking our blood vessels.
Decreased lipid peroxidation is a key factor in lowering risk of many chronic heart problems.
Recent research has shown that the quercetin content of apples also provides our cardiovascular system with anti-inflammatory benefits.
What a fantastic combination of cardiovascular benefits from such a widely available and delicious fruit!
This area of research on apple benefits is relatively new, but it s already awakening the interest of an increasing number of food scientists.
At many different levels, the polyphenols in apples are clearly capable of influencing our digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, and the overall impact of these changes is to improve regulation of our blood sugar.
Slowing down of carbohydrate digestion.
Quercetin and other flavonoids found in apples act to inhibit carbohydrate-digesting enzymes like alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase.
When these enzymes are inhibited, carbohydrates are broken down less readily into simple sugars, and less load is placed on our bloodstream to accommodate more sugar.
Reduction of glucose absorption.
Polyphenols in apples clearly lower the rate of glucose absorption from our digestive tract.
Once again, this change lessens the sugar load on our bloodstream.
Stimulation of the pancreas to put out more insulin.
Getting sugar out of our bloodstream often requires the help of insulin, a hormone produced by the beta cells of our pancreas.
By telling the beta cells of our pancreas to produce more insulin, the polyphenols found in apple can help us clear more sugar from our blood and keep our blood sugar level in better balance.
Stimulation of insulin receptors to latch on to more insulin and increase the flow of sugar out of our bloodstream and into our cells.
In order for sugar to leave our bloodstream and enter our cells  especially our muscle cells , insulin receptors on those cells must bind together with the insulin hormone and create cell changes that will allow sugar to pass through the cell membrane and into the cell.
Polyphenols in apples help to activate the muscle cell insulin receptors, and in this way, they help facilitate passage of sugar from our bloodstream up into our cells.
Once again, the result is better blood sugar regulation in our body.
Although some preliminary results show apple benefits for several different cancer types  especially colon cancer and breast cancer , it s the area of lung cancer benefits that stand out in the apple research.
There are numerous studies involving vegetable fruit intake and risk of lung cancer.
The number of subjects in these studies numbers into the high hundreds of thousands.
Although many research studies show an impressive ability of overall fruit and or vegetable intake to lower lung cancer risk, very few individual fruits show up as protective against lung cancer.
Except apples!
It s really quite remarkable how apples have been one of the few fruits to demonstrate this unique relationship with lung cancer risk reduction.
Researchers aren t certain why apples are so closely associated with reduction of lung cancer risk.
Their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits are definitely involved here, but they don t fully explain why apples are such a standout in this health benefit area.
We look forward to future research that will help shed light on this unique capacity in apples.
Like the lung cancer benefits of apples, the anti-asthma benefits have been somewhat surprising to health researchers.
Multiple studies have shown apple intake to be associated with decreased risk of asthma.
However, in some cases, the study findings have been even stronger.
In one study, apples showed better risk reduction for asthma than total fruit-plus-vegetable intake combined!
That comparison might seem like a contradiction since fruit-plus-vegetable intake would clearly include apples.
Like the anti-cancer benefits of apples, apples  anti-asthma benefits are definitely associated with the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients found in this fruit.
However, there is very likely to be something else going on as well since apples appear to be a truly standout fruit in this regard.
While not as developed as research in other areas, preliminary health benefits of apples have also been established for several age-related health problems, including macular degeneration of the eye and neurodegenerative problems, including Alzheimer s disease.
In animal studies, prevention of bone loss has also been an area of investigation, particularly related to the phloridizin content of apples.
Apples are a crisp, white-fleshed fruit with a red, yellow or green skin.
The apple is actually a member of the Rose family, which may seem strange until we remember that roses make rose hips, which are fruits similar to the apple.
Apples have a moderately sweet, refreshing flavor and a tartness that is present to greater or lesser degree depending on the variety.
For example, Golden and Red Delicious apples are mild and sweet, while Pippins and Granny Smith apples are notably brisk and tart.
Tart apples, which best retain their texture during cooking, are often preferred for cooked desserts like apple pie, while Delicious apples and other sweeter varieties like Braeburn and Fuji apples are usually eaten raw.
The apple tree, which originally came from Eastern Europe and southwestern Asia, has spread to most temperate regions of the world.
Over the centuries, many hybrids and cultivars have been developed, giving us the 7,000 varieties in the market today.
Apples have long been associated with the biblical story of Adam and Eve, although there is actually no mention that, in fact, the fruit in question was actually an apple.
In Norse mythology, apples were given a more positive persona: a magic apple was said to keep people young forever.
Johnny Appleseed—a real person named John Chapman—walked barefoot across an area of 100,000 square miles, planting apple trees that provided food and a livelihood for generations of settlers.
Look for firm fruits with rich coloring.
Yellow and green apples with a slight blush are best.
Your preference for a sweeter or more tart fruit and whether you plan to enjoy your apples raw or cooked will guide your choice of variety.
Just remember that Red and Golden Delicious are among the sweetest apples.
Braeburn and Fuji apples are slightly tart, and Gravenstein, Pippin, and Granny Smith apples are the most tart, but retain their texture best during cooking.
In the northern hemisphere, apple season begins at the end of summer and lasts until early winter.
Apples available at other times have been in cold storage or are imported from the southern hemisphere.
Whole apples are a much better nutritional choice than apple juice.
Not only are whole apples richer in dietary fiber, but the current processes of juicing seem to drastically reduce the polyphenolic phytonutrient concentrations originally found in the whole fruit.
Apples can be stored for relatively long  3-4 months  periods of time.
Cold storage at low refrigerator temperatures  35-40F 2-4C  is able to help minimize loss of nutrients.
In addition, it s helpful to maintain some moisture in the cold storage area, for example, by inclusion of damp cheesecloth in the crisper bin of a refrigerator.
Over a period of time involving months, there is loss of total polyphenols from apples, including both flavonoid and non-flavonoid polyphenols.
However, valuable amounts of polyphenols  and all other nutrients  remain.
In some food traditions, cold storage of apples over the winter months is still counted on as a key part of dietary nourishment from fruits.
You ve no doubt heard the saying,  one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch.  Well, research studies agree.
An apple that has been bruised from being dropped  or that has been damaged in some other way  will start to release unusual amounts of ethylene gas.
This ethylene gas can pose a risk to other apples that have not been damaged and greatly decrease their shelf life.
For this reason, it s important to handle apples with tender loving care, and also to remove any damaged apples from groups of apples stored in bulk.
The skin of the apple is unusually rich in nutrients, and even if the recipe you ve chosen requires peeled apples, consider leaving the skins on to receive the unique benefits found in the skins.
Ideally, of course, choose organic apples to avoid problems related to pesticide residues and other contaminants on the skins.
If you cannot obtain organic apples, and you are willing to accept some level of risk related to consumption of residues on the apple skins, we believe that it can still be a good trade-off between nutrients and contaminants if you leave the skin of the apple intact and eat the apple unpeeled.
Just be sure to thoroughly rinse the entire apple under a stream of pure water while gently scrubbing the skin with a natural bristle brush for 10-15 seconds.
To prevent browning when slicing apples for a recipe, simply put the slices in a bowl of cold water to which a spoonful of lemon juice has been addedFor use in future recipes, sliced apples freeze well in plastic bags or containers.
There s an important loss of nutrients that usually occurs when apples are processed into applesauce, and an even greater loss when they are processed into juice.
Some types of processing are easier on nutrients than others, but in general, apple sauces require boiling of apples and apple juices require some extraction of pulp.
In all cases, the more apple that can be retained, the better the resulting nourishment.
Processing can take a special toll on polyphenols.
We ve seen recent studies where only 10% of the flavonols and 3% of the catechins from the original apples remained present in the processed apple juice, Even chlorogenic acid  one of the more stable polyphenols in apples  tends to be decreased by at least 50% during the processing of whole apples into juice.
Obviously, there are exceptions to these generalized findings.
For example, it is possible to put whole apples into a powerful blender and consume the resulting juice.
In this case, very little if any of the nutrients are lost.
However, this type of blending is not used in the commercial production of apple juice.
Commercial apple juices are typically either  clear  or  cloudy.  Clear apple juices have the vast majority of the apple pomace  pulpy apple solids  removed.
Cloudy apple juices typically retain some of these pulpy solids because even though the pulpy solids have been removed from the juice through pressing and filtering, they are added back in at some designated level.
When purchasing apple juice, always choose cloudy juices if possible.
Add diced apples to fruit or green salads.
Braise a chopped apple with red cabbage.

Sliced apples  either alone or with other fruits  and cheese are a European favorite.
S.
Even though pesticides are present in food at very small trace levels, their negative impact on health is well documented.
The liver s ability to process other toxins, the cells  ability to produce energy, and the nerves  ability to send messages can all be compromised by pesticide exposure.
According to the Environmental Working Group s 2014 report  Shopper s Guide to Pesticides,  conventionally grown apples are among the top 12 fruits and vegetables on which pesticide residues have been most frequently found.
Therefore, individuals wanting to avoid pesticide-associated health risks may want to avoid consumption of apples unless they are grown organically.
If you do purchase non-organic apples, you may want to ask your grocer about the kind of wax used to protect the apple s surface during storage or shipping.
Carnauba wax  from the carnauba palm tree , beeswax, and shellac  from the lac beetle  are preferable to petroleum-based waxes, which contain solvent residues or wood resins.
Apple polyphenols are standout nutrients in this widely loved fruit.
These polyphenols include flavonols  especially quercetin, but also kaempferol and myricetin , catechins  especially epicatechin , anthocyanins  if the apples are red-skinned , chlorogenic acid, phloridizin, and several dozen more health-supportive polyphenol nutrients.
Apple is a good source of fiber, including both soluble and insoluble pectins, and it s also a good source of vitamin C.
Apple nutrients are disproportionately present in the skin, which is a particularly valuable part of the fruit with respect to its nutrient content.
For an in-depth nutritional profile click here: Apples .
In addition to the nutrients highlighted in our ratings chart, an  in-depth nutritional profile for Apples is also available.
This profile includes information on a full array of nutrients, including carbohydrates, sugar, soluble and insoluble fiber, sodium, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids and more.
In order to better help you identify foods that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories they contain, we created a Food Rating System.
This system allows us to highlight the foods that are especially rich in particular nutrients.
The following chart shows the nutrients for which this food is either an excellent, very good, or good source  below the chart you will find a table that explains these qualifications .
If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the food doesn t contain it.
It simply means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or concentration to meet our rating criteria.
To read this chart accurately, you ll need to glance up in the top left corner where you will find the name of the food and the serving size we used to calculate the food s nutrient composition.
This serving size will tell you how much of the food you need to eat to obtain the amount of nutrients found in the chart.
Now, returning to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient amount it offers, the percent Daily Value  DV%  that this amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for this food and nutrient, and the rating we established in our rating system.

Apple s campaign starring a  Genius  from its stores didn t live up to the marketer s usual efforts.
The favored ad was created by a rival agency: Apple s in-house shop.
Recounted by a creative who has worked on the brand recently, it s a scene that would have been unfathomable before the death of Apple s creative heart and soul, Steve Jobs, roughly two-and-a-half years ago.
But today Apple is thinking differently about its approach to advertising and marketing.
Very differently.
Amid criticisms that it has failed to innovate, Apple is increasingly taking marketing into its own hands.
It s madly building an internal agency that it s telling recruits will eventually number 1,000 -- the size of Grey Advertising.
It s pitting TBWA MAL against this internal agency with  jump balls  to mine the best creative ideas, a controversial tactic with outside agencies, let alone an internal one.
It s going after some of adland s boldest-faced names to staff its in-house shop -- in some cases, it s even poached executives from TBWA MAL.
And, in what once would have been seen as a sacrilegious breach of the Apple-MAL bond, it s been inviting some of the ad industry s top shops to pitch on major projects.
Apple and TBWA MAL declined to comment for this story.
But interviews with at least two dozen current and former employees of Apple, TBWA MAL, ad-industry professionals approached by the company and those who have worked with Apple reveal a powerful brand searching to regain its creative edge.
Once the ad industry s maverick, the company has struggled to deliver a campaign that lives up to the  Think Different  legacy, marred by missteps like the Olympics 2012  Genius Bar  ads that quickly got pulled.
Meanwhile, other tech marketers have eclipsed Apple with their creativity and cojones, a fact not lost on the Cupertino company.
I watched the Samsung pre-Super Bowl ad that launched today.
The words could be a call to arms or represent a certified marketing creative crisis.
Meanwhile, in addition to surging Samsung, Google has proved to be one of advertising s most-emulated storytellers, with traditional ads and online experiences that deftly weave humanity into its brand message.
In May, Google kicked Apple out of the top spot in BrandZ s annual ranking of Most Valuable Global brands, a position Apple held for three consecutive years.
Apple clearly sees the urgency.
In April, a Wall Street Journal article during the patent dispute between Apple and Samsung brought to light an early 2013 email from Mr.
Ad Age learned that since at least the beginning of 2013, Apple has been calling adland s hottest shops to work on various projects.
One of those was to San Francisco-based Pereira & O Dell , which conceived the Emmy- and multiple Cannes-Lion-winning  Beauty Inside  social film for Intel  Toshiba .
According to Co-Founder Chief Creative Officer PJ Pereira, Apple reached out to his agency over the past year for two projects, at least one of which would have been long-term.
People close to the situation say that Apple continues to call other top creative agencies in on projects.
In April, the brand went on a digital hiring spree and added four shops to its roster: WPP s AKQA , Interpublic s Huge and indie agencies Area 17 and Kettle  see Ad Age, April 9, 2014  .
Under Mr.
Jobs  watch, the brand was famously  traditionalist  when it came to advertising, especially for a tech company.
For the most part, its standout work was confined to TV and print.
The addition of the shops suggests the brand is trying to bring more creativity and innovation to its digital marketing.
Last fall, Ad Age reported that Apple was looking to build out its in-house team to 600 people from 300.
Today, according to a high-level agency exec recently approached, Apple has upped that number to a massive 1,000.
By comparison, Google s lauded Creative Lab, which steers some of the brand s most high-profile work, is said to have fewer than 100 people, not all of whom are full-timers.
Google s marketing, however, isn t done solely out of the lab.
To staff its internal agency, Apple is casting its net wide.
One senior agency exec noted that within the same six-month period of being contacted by Apple, a number of other senior creative execs at both this person s agency and other shops had gotten calls.
All I know is all my talented friends have been approached.
For various reasons, however, top talent has resisted the pitch.
In addition to Apple s flagging creative reputation, another recruiting hurdle for the company is its cost-prohibitive location.
To be sure, Apple still has plenty of appeal.
Apple recruitment.
The brand has managed to snag a few top names.
Among them is Bill Davenport, the Wieden & Kennedy partner who helped to launch the agency s entertainment unit, W&K Entertainment, and earlier in his career steered notable projects for Levi s and Nike , including the latter s famous  Bo Knows  spot.
It s not yet known what role he will play, but people close to the situation say he was hired to lead in-house production.
Executives close to the business said Apple has been beefing up production beyond Mr.
Davenport and is looking to create a full-function production department capable of handling not just creative but business-side affairs.
In April, branding agency Wolff Olins   Global CEO Karl Heiselman told Ad Age he would be joining Apple in a marketing-communications role.
Mr.
Heiselman had been a design contractor at Apple in the 1990s before Mr.
Jobs returned to revitalize the company.
Another addition is Tyler Whisnand, a former Wieden & Kennedy, Portland, creative director who worked on notable campaigns such as Levi s  Go Forth  and Nike s award-winning  Chalkbot.  People familiar with the situation say Larry Frey, another W&K creative alum who co-founded 180 Amsterdam and is also a commercial director, has joined the in-house team.
In March of this year, Brian Rekasis joined as director, worldwide marketing and communications.
He recently served as senior VP-exec producer at integrated-production company B-Reel, a former Creativity Production Company of the Year known for its sophisticated multiplatform campaigns for marketers such as Intel, Doritos and Google.
Meanwhile, Apple has poached a number of former MAL staffers, including Creative Directors Hector Muelas and Ricardo Viramontes, and Creative Director Larry Corwin, who previously held creative director positions at Google, BBH , BBDO and Goodby Silverstein & Partners .
Apple has tapped former Madison Avenue recruiters to ramp up its head-hunting efforts.
Among them, Linda Waste, a senior recruiting manager who previously worked at DDB Chicago , Energy BBDO and Euro RSCG; and senior recruiter Greg Christman, former talent director at TBWA MAL and recruiter at Google Creative Lab.
At the same time, according to people familiar with the situation, TBWA MAL has become more aggressive in its own recruiting.
While hiring efforts are in full force, Apple has changed its approach to getting creative work as it continues to increase its ad spending.
1 billion, up from $1 billion in 2012 and $933 million in 2011.
Much of the purview over Apple advertising lies with Hiroki Asai, who came up at the company through package design -- and is said by one creative to be  the creative director of all things internal  who has  really evolved into this very powerful person  at Apple.
But his job is more complicated now than it once was, given the expansion of the internal agency and subsequent shootouts.
In addition to overseeing much  if not all  creative internally, he is reportedly also one of the main client contacts for TBWA MAL.
Outside of controversial emails, Mr.
Schiller plays a leading role as well.
People familiar with the situation say it s under him that Apple has introduced -- or at least intensified -- a competitive dynamic between its in-house team and TBWA MAL through creative shootouts.
That s the type of warfare typically found between competing shops, not agency and client.
One creative who worked for Apple said the shootouts began last summer when the company was prepping to launch the iPhone 5C.
This creative noted that it appeared as though the shootouts would continue, but not every project will go that route.
For instance, Apple s holiday ad, featuring a loner teen who seems to pull away from his family s holiday festivities but ultimately turned out to be creating a surprising gift, was assigned to Media Arts Lab.
Among the first shootouts last summer, according to one creative close to the business, was for the  Intention  film, which debuted at last year s World Wide Developer s conference.
TBWA MAL s work won, earning a lot of attention in the design and fanboy community for reclaiming Apple s authoritative voice.
The addition of new agencies and the shootouts reflect what one person close to the situation said was Mr.
Schiller s preference for having as many people working on the business as possible.
According to one former TBWA MAL creative, this is not the way the partnership used to work.
For whatever reason, MAL is seen as part of the old way of doing things,  said a creative who has worked on Apple marketing.  The people running MAL made sense with the way Steve Jobs liked to work.
They had Wednesday reviews, they d fly up to Apple and show work, and there was a process with Jobs.
Apple originally made its creative mark with longtime agency Chiat Day, and later, Media Arts Lab.
Part of the TBWA agency network, the latter evolved from of the longtime creative partnership established at Chiat between its founder, Lee Clow, and Mr.
Jobs, whose collaboration birthed iconic ads such as the  1984  Super Bowl spot and the 1997  Think Different  campaign.
TBWA MAL kept up the creative pace with more recent winners including the  Mac vs. PC campaign.
Execs approached by Apple for internal jobs were told that TBWA MAL would continue to be part of the picture -- but in what capacity remains unclear.
Some say it will need to fill the service-side duties Apple can t handle internally.
Others paint a bleaker picture of the shop s future with Apple.
For now, however, it seems it will remain a creative player for Apple, but as part of a growing, more competitive and more comprehensive marketing mix.
One person close to the matter said Apple s in-house marketing leads have permission from Messrs.
Cook and Schiller to scale its marketing and communications resources to catch up to its business growth over the last few years.
They said they have so much going on from a marketing-communications standpoint that MAL is part of their plan, but their expectations for marketing are much greater than what MAL is built to do,  said one top exec approached for a post.  They re just expanding their practice.
It s hard to say whether the new approach has directly led to better product, but in the last few months, the marketer has clearly turned out better ads, work that helps forgive the  Genius Bar Guy  faux pas.
Recent ads created by the internal agency include the 5C launch spot dubbed  Greetings.  It also handled last fall s iPad air spot  Pencil,  as well as another that featured a voice-over of Robin Williams from the movie  Dead Poets Society.  Meanwhile, outside of  Intention,  TBWA MAL delivered the brand s recent Pixies-fueled ad  Powerful  and the charming holiday spot.
The broader creative picture shows that Apple is lining up as much talent -- on all fronts -- to inject innovation back into its game.
Outside of marketing and communication, in October of last year, Apple generated buzz when to revitalize retail it hired Angela Ahrendts, the Burberry CEO known for bringing the once-stodgy brand into the modern age with groundbreaking digital initiatives.
The recent $3 billion acquisition of Beats also brings music entrepreneurs Dr.
Dre and Jimmy Iovine into the boardroom as senior advisers on content.
Big moves, all proving Apple s determination to up its game.
But reinvention won t be an easy process for the company or the agency that helped build it.
Anand Lal Shimpi, the editor and publisher of the well-regarded AnandTech site, is going to work at Apple.
An Apple rep confirmed that the company was hiring Shimpi, but wouldn’t provide any other details.
Last night, via a post on the site he founded in 1997, Shimpi said he was “officially retiring from the tech publishing world,” but didn’t say what he was doing next.
I won’t stay idle forever.
There are a bunch of challenges out there : ,” he wrote.
Unlike many tech publications, AnandTech focused much of its energy on the guts of new devices, via reports on chips and other hardware components.
Shimpi’s post also announced that AnandTech would continue publishing, and would be run by new editor in chief Ryan Smith.
Mr Shimpi is obviously very talented and smart, and has exhibited a lot of integrity in reports such as speed power analyses of CPUs—using equipment supplied by Intel.
I hope that we can get a bit more insight what he ll be doing, just I ve wondered a while why Kevin Lynch came over from Adobe.
The only place he could go that was up, from where he was already.
Very respected and great judgment.
I ll miss his contributions to the website, even if it continues without him.
I hope to see great things from him at Apple.

Apple   AAPL   on Tuesday introduced two new iPhones, its long-awaited Apple Watch and a mobile payment system as part of a marketing blitz aimed at drumming up consumer excitement.
Now the question is whether the new gear will live up to the hype .
ET start, a fitting delay for a company that has kept its fans waiting for a new product.
First up was the company s new larger, thinner iPhone 6 , which  features an aluminum body and glass front that curves around the sides.
5 inch-screen.
Gesturing toward giant photos  of a lizard and a butterfly projected  on-stage, Schiller also  highlighted the new iPhone s enhanced camera,  which he said includes  image-stabilization functionality.
The new phones will be available Sept.
19 ; pre-orders begin Sept.
12 .
With a two-year contract, the iPhone 6 will cost $199 for a model with  16 gigabytes of memory, $299 for the 64GB phone and $399 for 128GB.
The  iPhone 6 Plus is priced at $299  16GB , $399  64GB  and $499  128GB .
CNET Editor-at-Large Tim Stevens .
The technology giant has much riding on the popular reception to its new iPhone, sales of which drive most of the company s profits and which account for more than half of its revenue.
But Apple s new  offerings may be even more important, as the company seeks to  entice customers with an expanded lineup of products and services designed to keep them within its technological ecosystem.
To that end, Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the company s new mobile payments tool, called Apple Pay , which aims to let users make purchases from their iPhone or Apple Watch.
He noted that Americans make roughly 200 million payments per day, but called the process  antiquated.  With Apple Pay, consumers can pay for goods without sharing credit card, address and other personal information with a merchant, Cook said.
Apple Pay uses short-distance wireless technology called near-field communication, or NFC, to enable users to make purchases -- a system already built in to many Android phones.
Apple has teamed with financial industry heavyweights including American Express   AXP  , Mastercard   MA   and Visa   V   and says Apple Pay will work at more than 220,000 retailers nationwide.
Apple has been working with companies like McDonald s, Disney, Target, Subway, and Whole Foods to integrate its service as well.
Apple CEO Tim Cook announces the Apple Watch during an Apple special event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts on Sept.
9, 2014 in Cupertino, California.
The watch, which is available with six interchangeable bands, comes in stainless steel, aluminum or 18K gold and is priced at $349.
Users navigate by tapping and swiping the face, as well as through a crown on the right side of the watch that brings up apps.
Apple Watch, which works with the iPhone 5, 5c and 5s, as well as the iPhone 6, will be available early next year .
Cook said.
Ian Fogg, senior director for research firm IHS, said Apple wants to validate wearable gadgets in the same way the iPhone in 2007 established a mass market for smartphones.
Although Apple has posted solid financial results this year, investors and even some of the company s famously rabid fans have seemed underwhelmed by recent product launches.
The last iPhones and iPads, while commercially successful, have been deemed only incremental advances -- pleasing refinements that remain well short of the big leaps forward Apple has made in the course of growing into the most valuable company in the world.
That s of particular concern for a company that, under co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, was vaunted for its design prowess and ability to discern consumer tastes even before those were fully formed.
Apple is also eager to reclaim market share taken in recent years by Samsung and other makers of mobile phones based on Google s   GOOG   Android platform.
For Cook, the Apple Watch could prove either a canny move into a lucrative new product segment, or a dead end.
The gadget -- which fans referred to as the Apple iWatch as rumors intensified in recent months that a device was imminent --  is the first developed entirely under Cook s leadership since he succeeded Jobs as CEO in 2011.
For both Apple and other companies making smartwatches, it also represents a key test of consumer interest in a technology that to date has failed to dazzle customers.
A critical challenge for Apple, experts say: Building a device that -- like the iPod, iPhone and iPad before it -- compellingly fills a need users may not know they have.
No surprise, then, that Cook touted HealthKit, a software development tool that integrates health and fitness apps through the Apple Watch while giving consumers control over what health data they choose to share.
Although the company could benefit from expanding into new product  segments, in the short-term it remains highly dependent on rolling out  devices that push the design envelope and capture the public s  imagination.
Indeed, until today Apple hadn t released a brand new product since launching the iPad four year ago.
In the interim, Apple s competitors have stormed into a range of areas ripe for innovation, with Google working to develop driverless cars and Facebook   FB   pushing the envelope on virtual reality.
That has raised concerns that, without Jobs, Apple risks losing the vision that powered its rise.
Perhaps more than any tech provider, Apple is under the gun to innovate.
And to be sure it is trying mightily to do that.
Along with expanding into the wearable computing segment, Apple is developing Internet-enabled tools people can use to control lights, thermostats and other parts of their home .
For enterprises, meanwhile, the company wants to let employers harness the power of  Big Data  from their Apple devices.
A lot of other companies don t need to be as bold on a frequent basis as  Apple,  Soumen Ganguly, a director at consulting firm Altman  Vilandrie & Co., told CNET ahead of Apple s latest commercial launch.  But people have come to expect it from Apple.
A sense that Apple may be losing its bite hasn t kept investors from bidding up its shares, it s worth noting -- the company s stock has risen nearly 26 percent this year.
65, topping $100, shortly after the presentation began.
If there are questions about Apple s creative mojo, it is clear from Tuesday s event that its marketing instincts remain intact.
Winding up the event, Cook brought out the band U2 to play a tune and pitch the group s new album , which the executive said will be available for free download for all iTunes users.
I m backstage and this is my first tweet from my iPhone 6.
It s amazing.

Apple finally added NFC to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but if you were hoping that the company’s new NFC chip will allow you to pair speakers or integrate NFC tags into your favorite apps, you’ll have to keep waiting.
Apple has put its NFC chip on lockdown, at least for now.
Sources at Apple have confirmed to Cult of Mac that the NFC chip on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will only be used for Apple Pay when it launches this week.
Like Touch ID on the iPhone 5s, Apple is keeping NFC closed off from developers at launch.
The company declined to comment on future plans for the NFC chip, but unlike Touch ID on the iPhone 5s, you won’t find any Apple marketing materials promoting the addition of NFC as a major iPhone 6 feature, as it’s touted as just a component of Apple Pay.
NFC products can be put to all sorts of creative uses, from pairing devices, to sharing files, launching apps, or even automating your entire house.
Bluetooth LE has been Apple’s go-to communication protocol for iBeacons and other location services, but opening the NFC chip up to developers could quickly expand the iPhone’s capabilities in the future.
All is not lost for developers hoping to see NFC API’s in the future, as the NXP-manufactured NFC chip Apple is using in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus appears to be capable of providing open access to the NFC controller, according to experts PC Advisor spoke with at RapidNFC.
Apple has already showed that its NFC chip has extended capabilities beyond Apple Pay.
For example, the Apple Watch was demoed unlocking a hotel room with NFC at last week’s Apple event.
That indicates some partners will get NFC access before it’s opened to all developers.
Considering that its touch-less payments system is brand spanking new, it’s not surprising Apple wants to keep access tight while testing the NFC waters.

The iPad Mini 3 comes with an upgrade that’s as modest as can be.
It’s new features include Touch ID and a gold color option.

Yesterday, Apple pushed a rather spooky security update for iOS that suggested that something was horribly wrong with SSL TLS in iOS but gave no details.
Since the answer is at the top of the Hacker News thread, I guess the cat s out of the bag already and we re into the misinformation-quashing stage now.
Note the two goto fail lines in a row.
The first one is correctly bound to the if statement but the second, despite the indentation, isn t conditional at all.
The code will always jump to the end from that second goto, err will contain a successful value because the SHA1 update operation was successful and so the signature verification will never fail.
This signature verification is checking the signature in a ServerKeyExchange message.
This is used in DHE and ECDHE ciphersuites to communicate the ephemeral key for the connection.
The server is saying “here s the ephemeral key and here s a signature, from my certificate, so you know that it s from me”.
Now, if the link between the ephemeral key and the certificate chain is broken, then everything falls apart.
It s possible to send a correct certificate chain to the client, but sign the handshake with the wrong private key, or not sign it at all!
There s no proof that the server possesses the private key matching the public key in its certificate.
1 .
It affects anything that uses SecureTransport, which is most software on those platforms although not Chrome and Firefox, which both use NSS for SSL TLS.
However, that doesn t mean very much if, say, the software update systems on your machine might be using SecureTransport.
1266 .
Note the port number  which is the CVE number , the normal site is running on port 443 and that is expected to work.
On port 1266 the server is sending the same certificates but signing with a completely different key.
If you can load an HTTPS site on port 1266 then you have this bug.
Because the certificate chain is correct and it s the link from the handshake to that chain which is broken, I don t believe any sort of certificate pinning would have stopped this.
Also, this doesn t only affect sites using DHE or ECDHE ciphersuites - the attacker gets to choose the ciphersuite in this case and will choose the one that works for them.
2.
But, again, the attacker can choose any version that the client will accept.
2 then it appears that would workaround this issue.
Likewise, if the client only enabled the plain, RSA ciphersuites then there s no ServerKeyExchange and that should also work around this issue.
2 fix the issue.
9 for OS X but existed in at least some versions of iOS 6.
This sort of subtle bug deep in the code is a nightmare.
I believe that it s just a mistake and I feel very bad for whoever might have slipped in an editor and created it.
3 from Xcode make a peep about the dead code.
That s surprising to me.
A better warning could have stopped this but perhaps the false positive rate is too high over real codebases?
Maybe the coding style contributed to this by allowing ifs without braces, but one can have incorrect indentation with braces too, so that doesn t seem terribly convincing to me.
A test case could have caught this, but it s difficult because it s so deep into the handshake.
One needs to write a completely separate TLS stack, with lots of options for sending invalid handshakes.
In Chromium we have a patched version of TLSLite to do this sort of thing but I cannot recall that we have a test case for exactly this.
Code review can be effective against these sorts of bug.
Not just auditing, but review of each change as it goes in.
I ve no idea what the code review culture is like at Apple but I strongly believe that my colleagues, Wan-Teh or Ryan Sleevi, would have caught it had I slipped up like this.
Although not everyone can be blessed with folks like them.

Apple   NASDAQ :AAPL  designs, manufactures, and markets smart personal devices and high end personal computers addressing both the consumer electronics space and industry through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers.
The company s products include the Macintosh  Mac  family of personal computers , the iconic iPod portable music player, the iPhone , and, the iPad.
Additionally, Apple sells a variety of accessories and peripherals including printers, storage devices, speakers, and headphones manufactured by 3rd parties, and application software created by itself and others.
An entire ecology has grown up around its products  .
Under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple s co-founder who returned to head the company in 1996, Apple has demonstrated considerable acumen in implementing high-technology in product design and marketing, generating sustained enthusiasm and substantial growth as it continues to redefine and re-invent whole new markets.
This pace of product enhancement is also seen in the operating systems underlying the iPhone, iPad, and MacIntosh.
Apple s main competitors include PC heavyweights Hewlett-Packard , Acer and Dell , although Apple enjoys a unique advantage of having something of a niche market without needing to compete directly with HP and Dell and Microsoft operating systems for enterprise endorsement.
Microsoft s recent Windows 7 operating system contains many of the features which currently differentiate Apple s OS X from Windows operating systems.
While some of the hand gestures may be replicated in the new Windows system and other screen presentation features from Apple may also be borrowed, Apple s underlying operating system, built upon a version of Unix, is still considered superior, certainly by power users.
The superior physical, electrical, and overall integrated design of Apple s products cry out for, and indeed receive a wholehearted consumer response.
Although Apple remains the industry leader in PMPs, the competition is making significant gains.
The popularity of flash-based PMPs is problematic for Apple, which has much stronger market presence in hard-drive based  HDD  players.
To combat this, Apple may release a new flash-based line of players, in addition to a souped-up and rehauled version of HDD iPods.
SanDisk s Sansa players, one model of which beat the Nano to market, with more GB and a lower price point.
Creative s Zen, which has a strong grounding in flash-based players--including the first true widescreen video PMP with the Zen Vision W.
Tunes  main competitors include cross platform rivals such as Nokia , which boasts the Nokia Ovi Store,  as well as independent subscription-based music service sites such as Spotify.
Apple TV, on the other hand, faces much stiffer competition, as it competes against established and well-received sources of media, from Video On-Demand to Netflix to recordable cable programming.
All three of these distribution channels offer significantly higher image quality than much of what is available on Apple TV.
Apple s iPhone must compete with established mobile phone and PDA companies, including the likes of ]  , Motorola , Nokia , and Sony , many of which have significantly larger R&D budgets than Apple.
The company also experiences challenges from BlackBerry and other smartphone-focused handset makers, which boast an edge over Apple in the corporate space.
Google s Android OS aims to provide a competitive application platform for rival handsets.
Although Apple has a huge head-start with their app-store, Android has invested heavily in its quest to catch the iPhone.
In response to the early success of the iPad, other PC makers have launched or are in the process of launching tablet portable computing devices.
Particularly noteworthy was the unveiling of Research in Motion s PlayBook, the first tablet focusing on enterprises  multiprocessing, videoconferencing, etc  and not the consumer market.
The PlayBook was built with a simpler, more web-based operating system different than that in its BlackBerry phones to facilitate app development  .
Dell s Streak, HP s Slate, Cisco s Cius, and Samsung s Galaxy Tab have also been released, and tablets by Sony , Toshiba , Acer and LG have been announced  .
Relative to its competitors, the iPad benefits from well-established distribution channels and first mover advantage  .
However, competitors could offer attractive products in the form of smaller tablets with added features and at a lower price  like the pocket-sized Galaxy Tab, which has two cameras   .
Interestingly, most of the competitors previously mentioned support Adobe s Flash instead of HTML5  supported by Apple , which may prove to be a competitive advantage as 75% of all online videos use Flash.
Although Apple does not support Flash in its webpages, but allows mobile app developers to code using Flash  .
The iPad also competes in the e-reader market, which includes the black-and-white screened Amazon s Kindle and the Barnes & Noble Nook.
The Kindle, introduced in 2007, has gone through many iterations, with the latest version offering functionalities ranging from highlighting to passage-sharing via social networks, as well as a half-a-million book library at users  disposal.
The Nook, only available since October 2009, offers 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity, a color touchscreen with improved contrast, more font colors, and the ability to lend an ebook to a friend for up to two weeks  .

Apple introduced a new Photos app during its Worldwide Developers Conference that will become the new platform for the company.
As part of the transition, Apple told me today that they will no longer be developing its professional photography application, Aperture.
With the introduction of the new Photos app and iCloud Photo Library, enabling you to safely store all of your photos in iCloud and access them from anywhere, there will be no new development of Aperture,” said Apple in a statement provided to The Loop.
The new Photos app will also replace iPhoto, giving users a more seamless experience on Apple devices.
The app will allow you to edit and search your entire photos library in the cloud on any of your Apple devices.
Apple was very clear when I spoke with them this morning that development on other pro apps like Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro is continuing.
Professionals in those app categories should not worry about their apps—they will continue as normal.
Noooooooo!
Well actually that depends… are they going to maintain the same Pro type features and options as Aperture and to a lesser extent iPhoto or are they simply going to beef up the photo features of preview for instance and make the new Photos app just consumer focussed and leave photo folks in the hands of the likes of Adobe?
That’s a very precise statement.
If they meant that Photos would take over Aperture’s capabilities they would have worded this differently.
The fact that they made a point of saying “their professional photography application” suggests they are completely giving up and focusing entirely on a dumbed down photo storage app with simple editing tools.
You missed the quote over the paraphrase by one paragraph.
It suggests to me that they won’t have a separate pro application, not that they’re removing any sort of “pro” features.
It’s far too early to simply assume “it’s just a reworked iPhoto”, based on one phrase in a statement not even directly published by Apple.
Not that I think Jim’s paraphrasing or foolin’ us – just that a statement made to The Loop might not be subjected to the same level of Fine Parsing Control as a press release.
I’m sure he is paraphrasing, as otherwise he’d have put it in quotes.
But he’s not misleading anyone.
Too much not being said is being read between the lines.
Given the sensitive nature of this announcement, would you agree Apple could have done a better job communicating it?
If they wanted complete understanding about every aspect of Photos replacing iPhoto, then sure they could have communicated better.
But they said what they apparently wanted to say: iPhoto is being replaced by something more useful and capable.
0 .
My guess is that the Photos app will be both iPhoto for the cloud and Aperture for the cloud.
If you use Photos with an iPhone or similar camera, I would bet it will treat you like you are running iPhoto, but if you use Photos with a Canon 5D or similar camera, I would bet it will treat you like you are running Aperture.
The reason I say this is that Photos is a photo front end for iCloud, and sells iCloud storage.
Why wouldn’t they encourage people who own a Canon 5D to buy $100 of additional iCloud storage and upload their giant RAW files to the cloud?
At the same time, consumers who are using an iPhone will buy $25 of iCloud storage to store their tiny JPEG’s.
So there is an obvious way to monetize Photos for both consumer and pro photographers, and the app is going to have to support both consumer and pro cameras anyway.
Right now, there are likely users who are using a pro camera with iPhoto, and users who are using a consumer camera with Aperture.
It makes sense to combine the 2 apps into one app and respond in a consumer or pro way to whatever camera is being used, and to have only one kind of cloud library for Apple to manage on the back end.
Of course I don’t know this for sure.
But I would certainly hold off on freaking out until more is known about the Photos app and see if it is a good upgrade path for Aperture users.
The other alternative would be Apple abandoning the pro photography market to Adobe, which would put Apple in the same situation that they were in during the 1990′s when they had to go begging at Adobe for them to port Premiere to Mac OS X, which is what resulted in the creation of Final Cut Pro and the purchase of Logic.
I’ll take the other side of that bet.
Apple is getting out of supporting pro-level photo features.
The vast majority of Apple users want a simple solution to sync, store, and organize shots taken chiefly with their iDevice; the 95% solution.
The edge case of users who want and need solutions beyond what Photos will provide can turn to Lightroom.
Also, your 1990′s analogy is a bit misplaced.
The scale and marketplace, and thus the leverage, is dramatically different.
And as an aside, FCP was bought from Macromedia, not developed internally at Apple.
I don’t agree.
Aperture was one of the top grossing apps in the App Store.
They are doing a Final Cut X… starting from scratch bringing together all their modern frameworks, adding a robust plugin architecture, for all the great plugins that came make a powerful and complete app even better.
I will wait and see what happens before jumping ship.
Oh fuck me!
Lightroom it is then.
Not so sure the Photo app will be designed for pro semi pro photographers who need more fine tuning than grandma on her iMac.
M.
O.
Thank you!
I loved iView MediaPro when I started using it many years ago.
I thought this software was just abandon-ware after MS bought and re-branded it.
Looks like PhaseOne has revived it and offers nice upgrade prices too for us old iView and MS software owners.
Then if you’re not sure why have you already decided on lightroom?
Because I had already bought Lightroom, just hadn’t moved my 450Gb of RAW images over to it.
But it’s decided now I guess.
That was my first thought exactly.
Luckily, though, I don’t see them ditching Logic Pro for GarageBand in the foreseeable future.
Color.
Aperture has 9 years of history.
Aperture is the #4 top grossing app over in the Apple App Store.
LR and AP… in this scenario it definitely isn’t the most popular app in it’s class.
I still think Photos will surprise us.
Balls.
Aperture may be lacking in features, but unlike Lightroom, it has reliably worked.
Not for me.
My Aperture library has become corrupted several times  thankfully, photos are still intact , requiring me to rebuild the project structure  it doesn’t help that it doesn’t report the corruption, which means my backups also got corrupted .
I switched to Lightroom since then, which I frankly don’t think has as good UI as Aperture, but much faster and much more capable.
Yep.
M.
O.
I’ve got 30,000 photos in Aperture going back to 2004, and have never had a single corruption issue in its library.
So, your mileage clearly varies.
I suspect disk sector issues cause a lot of people’s issues, but they would cause issues with any data that sat on top of the disk corruption.
According to DiskWarrior, my disk is fine, although HFS+ not doing data integrity check, I can’t be 100%.
Having said that, Aperture frequently gets stuck in “Updating Library” when quitting the app and I have on many occasions, forced quit Aperture as a result.
So my library corruption could be a direct result of that.
M.
O.
I had a lot of that “stuck” when quitting behavior, too, at one point.
I had 8 GB of RAM in my 2011 Macbook Pro, and always thought that was adequate.
But recently I upgraded to the max for this Mac… 16 GB.
A lot of the spinning pinwheels have disappeared.
But yes, if you force-quit out of Aperture, it’s going to cause some issues it will have to rebuild at some point.
Will they also stop developing iPhoto?
It’s not quite clear to me from the text.
Yep!
Since iOS 7 was released, I’ve become convinced that Apple had to move in this direction.
The vast majority of photos created in the Apple ecosystem are never edited, and aren’t as extensively curated by the photographer as was the case even 5 years ago.
So why should the primary photo applications on MacOS X be associated with curating and editing anymore?
If Apple were to cater solely to what “the vast majority” of their users did on their computers, do you really think they could sell a lot of $2000-3000 computers in an age where a $600 PC can accomplish the same tasks?
The same tasks” don’t including “running OSX”.
And I’d love to see the links to these $600 PCs that are equivalent to a $2000 Mac?
1 3 the price.
The other interpretation is that you believe people are buying Retina MBPs and 27″ iMacs to do jobs a midrange Dell could do “the same”.
Which suggests either 1  they think OSX and OSX-only apps, and Apple’s design features and quality provide them lots of value or 2  somehow Apple and only Apple can convince huge numbers of people to spend three time as much money as needed on a computer?
Sony get in on that action?
Didn’t they kill their high-end VAIOs because nobody would buy them?
I didn’t say $600 PCs were equivalent.
I don’t think ANY PC is equivalent to ANY Mac, given the difference in OS and ecosystems.
I believe it is an influential minority of Apple customers that make better use of their computers’ potential and these people evangelize the brand and help inspire others to buy Apple products.
2-3000 macs aren’t using hem to just browse or send emails.
Speak for yourself.
I am… I love my Mac Pro.
Safari flies.
Mail opens in the blink of an eye.
Oh yeah, and with my 4k monitor, I can haz two browzers open and still have space for Facepalm.
Sigivald… You’re not the sharpest tool in the drawer, eh?
He never equated the $600 with the $2000 computer.
He just said a use can accomplish the same tasks… He never even said accomplish the same tasks with similar ease.
I never said anything about the vast majority of users.
I was talking about the vast majority of the photos that users create.
The pro-level photographers who used Aperture will have to think about switching at some point, mainly for large digital photo repository management.
But I’m willing to bet that the App Extensions in Yosemite that add editing and workflow support features to the new Photos app end up remaking the workflows of many professionals soon after Yosemite’s final release.
600 desktop cannot accomplish the same tasks as a $3000 workstation.
Actually I have found that many of the things I used to do in Photoshop, I’m now able to do in iPhoto, such as adjusting color.
I have done this for a living for the past 2 decades, so I was impressed with some of the editing features brought into iPhoto.
Since they keep adding more features, my feeling is that they are just coming out with one application, Photos, that will replace both of the older applications.
I have never used Aperture, or Lightroom, so I can’t comment on those.
And lately I actually do a fair amount of editing right on my iPhone using Adobe PS Express and a few other apps, which actually surprised me.
So a more robust editing app that will run on iOS is welcomed.
I can’t even remember the last time I opened iPhoto.
Agreed.
A photos app built for their new hardware and core iOS services, which were demoed at WWDC and looked amazing!
Photos will have a robust editing system more like Aperture than Photos, or perhaps surpassing both.
The question is why develop two separate applications when Apple’s new mantra is to give the stuff away?
When Photos is installed on millions of Macs there will be much better plugin support for truly advanced features beyond those that will already come with the package.
Apple could build one app and have in-app purchasing but again I think for photography they will give this stuff away for free.
I don’t want all of my photos to be on all of my devices.
I use Aperture for my pro stuff for a reason, it stores thousands of photos that need to be culled through before they end up on any cloud.
Since we don’t know what the feature set of Photos will be yet, it’s hard to say if curation will be negatively impacted.
It will be a truly odd move though if Apple can combine the consumer and professional apps into a single program.
You think so?
I think that keeping them separate is odd.
Having extra metadata and editing tools isn’t going to hurt the consumer if they’re done well.
The risk is that the pro users might lose out on a few tools.
Meanwhile, we’re getting so many photos that I think new organizational tools will useful to everyone.
Can Apple build organizational tools that will satisfy everyone?
I don’t see why not.
That said, I assume Photos is going to take a hit somewhere just like iMovie 08 did.
0.
The interesting thing, I think, is that Apple communicated this at all.
0  iPhoto 11  both shipped in 2010, after all.
The smart money is on Apple working on Photos for a year  probably more, maybe much more  already.
Aperture sends all my downloaded pics to iCloud Before I’ve edited them… Very annoying.
I had to disable that, but would have loved automatic uploading of edited versions or versions with 3+ stars, etc… They missed a trick there.
That bytes, I love Aperture.
Very sad, unless of course all the things I love about it are brought over to the Photos app.
Prof.
I’d like someone to clearly explain what’s really different about the Aperture app as opposed to iPhoto, and what extra features it really has.
Every time I’ve looked into switching to Aperture and downloaded the demo, it seems kind of like six of one and half a dozen of the other except for the look and feel.
I’m not saying they are the same, but they sure are very, very similar.
As are all photo library applications from any vendor.
Most of the folks I know that prefer Aperture, seem to do so only so they can pose as a “pro,” not because of any real extra features that they actually use that much.
Aperture gives you much better access to EXIF data, organization, advanced editing, Filters, External editing, Importing and Exporting, as well as much better Raw support.
I wouldn’t be surprised if many consumers of Aperture could do just as well as iPhoto, but Aperture is still MUCH more powerful – especially when working with multiple projects.
Importing options are TONS better.
Like where, importing with presets.
Tethering?
Tethering to an external HD + Internal drive at the same time?
Choosing where you want the photos to go if you don’t just want them in the Library?
Adjustments- Brushes.
Brushes on top of Brushes.
Selective adjustments with brushes and adjustments.
Retouching tools?
Exporting?
Millions of customizable Export options?
There’s ton’s.
Not just “SHARE”.
I’m talking about full on customized export options.
And with BorderFX plug-in, customized borders and watermarking?
I can export 16bit psd files to 500pixel wide medium rez jpegs with in a batch process and expedite to clients.
EXIF options?
I’m pretty upset if they REMOVE the tools pros need to expedite jobs.
But if the UPGRADE of let’s say….
Mavericks Keynote or Pages… is comparable to Aperture’s future.
This will be very very disheartening.
Right now though… I’m concerned about file management and how continuity will be between Aperture and the new….
Movie 2013 was a bad deal for my event library, so I’m not encouraged.
Prof.
With the greatest respect,  and thanks for all the responses , this still doesn’t seem hugely different in terms of feature sets to me.
Photo has EXIF data and lets you edit it, so it seems like Aperture having a bit more is not an essential difference and not impossible to add into the new app.
IMO if you are using “brushes” then you should really be using a different app altogether too, but most of the other differences could easily be addressed by a simple plug-in architecture.
Don’t speak out of ignorance.
The differences are extensive and profound.
Do you have any experience with Aperture?
Do you have any reason for your statement about brushes, or just spreading ignorance?
As for posing as a “Pro” — stop the troll-baiting as well, PROf.
Peabody.
You don’t edit EXIF information.
You edit IPTC information.
Is that what you meant?
Photo is a shadow compared to Aperture or Lightroom or Bridge Photoshop when it comes to metadata management.
Yes you do.
For example when the date on camera was set wrongly and many photos were taken.
When you realise it during post process, you can edit the EXIF to set the dates correctly.
My point was EXIF is not the metadata we’re talking about.
That is something you normally don’t edit – except in circumstances like you mention, and with specialized software.
You can’t edit EXIF metadata with Bridge, for example.
And for good reasons.
At the most basic level…iPhoto allows you to store RAW photos but only lets you edit JPEGs.
Aperture of course stores RAW but let you edit an uncompressed photo.
There is a drastic difference in your results.
The amount of light and color data lost in a JPEG is something like 90%.
Another difference is the way that Aperture and iPhoto handle their respective libraries.
I have seen number iPhoto libraries become corrupted crash ”move at a snail’s pace” because it loads all of the pictures in its Library.
Aperture only loads quick thumbnails then loads a RAW image one at a time.
We could fill a page with features we use that aren’t included in iPhoto but it would take even longer to explain how we use all those features.
The reason it doesn’t seem like a big deal is because you’re not understanding its significance to the user.
Have you used iPhoto recently?
RAW: iPhoto applies edits to raw files and saves the edits as JPEGs, true.
However, as you edit the edit list is re-applied to the RAW file from Masters.
You can export the edited images as RAW, too, bypassing JPEG entirely.
THUMBNAILS: iPhoto loads photos as necessary to render thumbnails.
Those are stored in Thumbnails.
You can sometimes outrun it and see the thumbnails in odd places as the full image is loaded.
I always thought the big draw of Aperture was RAW editing.
Aperture has far more flexible tools for managing and browsing image libraries along with far more sophisticated image editing tools that some years ago would have been the domain of apps like Photoshop.
Aperture is the better at organizing and processing photos than iPhoto.
There isn’t that much difference in the presentation layer, but Aperture really shines when you have RAW workflow with multiple libraries.
Also, the database structure is very solid.
Photo is aimed at the average home user, Aperture at advanced users.
I won’t say Pro as anyone with a large library could benefit from Aperture over iPhoto.
Until recently  and I don’t know when  Aperture would import all iCloud photos and put them in your library automatically, it created a uniquely named project for each month of imports.
Vaults.
You can have multiple backup drives that you rotate through and Aperture updates them all whenever they are seen.
Library switching from within the application.
Photo requires you to restart.
Export all your less-than-three-star photos to a separate library every year and you can keep down the number of photos active in your main library.
Light table.
When you’re previewing photos for a project you can drag a bunch of photos to a workspace and arrange and compare them.
EXIF data access.
I shoot with several cameras: my iPhone, iPad, Canon 40d and my GF’s Android phone.
With Aperture I can quickly locate images by the camera that took the image, the image size, whether the flash fired, exposure, or just about anything else you can imagine related to a photo.
Stacks.
If I shoot in high speed shutter rate I can choose the single best image and stack all the others behind  in rating order  so only the one image shows in a list.
Versions.
I can make edits to a photo without altering the original just like iPhoto, but I can freeze and permanently apply changes by creating a version at any time.
The version then can be altered and then the single best one put on top of a stack.
Plugins.
I regularly use de-noise and resize plugins for Aperture, the de-noise in bulk.
Theres simply no way to do this easily in iPhoto which does allow external editors but that requires manual interaction in the external editor.
Loupe.
Bring up the loupe and any photo on the screen  even thumbnails  can be viewed at 100%  or more  just like looking at a light table for film.
For me, those features add up to a compelling upgrade to iPhoto and if the Photos app does at least most of those things then I’ll eventually move to it.
This could be good.
Of course, it could be limited.
On the bright side, it could be one less application I need to manage.
Does anyone know if Photos will have any sort of plugin architecture?
You should start looking at Lightroom now, that way you have a grasp of it when Photos finally comes out and iPhoto & Aperture are no longer available.
Sure, and get ready to give up Aperture’s elegant interface and intuitive workflows for Adobe’s clunky and bloated alternative along with a forced rent-an-app subscription service.
What’s your point?
Do you have a better option that Lightroom for pro-level photo management?
Besides that, there probably isn’t a single person in these comments that has seen or used the new Photos app – so it’s kind of early to be worrying about this anyway.
I like DxO Optics.
The library management is so-so, but the editing is fantastic.
I can’t think of anything better for management than Aperture though.
Today, we don’t Know Anything about Photos.
Just That it Will be available early 2015 with icloud gallery photos.
Nothing more.
This is unfortunate.
What if I don’t want to pay Apple to store my photos?
Will Apple own or assume rights to my photos  as many cloud licenses decree ?
What are the cloud licensing complications of Apple storing photos that I don’t own  such as those borrowed from the web or licensed from stock images houses ?
Presumably they’ll only store photos in a certain directory.
It’s incredibly unwieldy to just upload all of the photos on your disk to the cloud, not to mention plainly dumb.
I hope so … I have 910GB of photos and videos in my Aperture library!
Just a suggestion keep them in your hard drives.
I don’t think you need to store them in iCloud when you are using the new Photos app if you don’t want to.
Will Apple own or assume rights to my photos  as many cloud licenses decree ?
Which licenses would those be?
Especially that make the cloud provider “own” your photos?
Cloud is mandatory?
The one from the keynote is definitely real, as that was demoed.
The screenshot above is interesting because: a  it shows a lot more control than was implied in the keynote.
I can’t find it anywhere on Apple’s website.
The Loop would post anything other than what was provided by Apple.
Jim, would you mind clarifying where that screenshot came from?
Or posting a higher res version of it?
If I can fiddle with the histogram and curves, then I won’t be so worried about this transition.
This is really bad news!
Apple is giving up on Pros again.
There is no way that the new Photos App is as featured as Aperture.
Stupid Apple.
There is no way that the new Photos App is as featured as Aperture.
You know this, how, exactly?
Quicktime X was a bit different.
It traded flexibility for efficiency.
This is pure abandonment without a replacement product.
Why Apple?
IF the screenshot is any indication, this actually has hopes of greatness.
You’re telling me that abandoning development of Quicktime 7 Pro for a more “efficient” Quicktime X is not the same thing as abandoning Aperture for Photos?
It’s the exact same thing.
What professional photo editing software does Microsoft produce?
The third party professional software that you’d purchase for windows likely also works on Mac OS, so I don’t understand how changing operating systems would solve the problem here.
I’m assuming if you switched back to Windows you wouldn’t use any Adobe products or Phase One products, which are also popular in the pro community and run on both Windows and Mac OS… Maybe Correl Paint Shop Pro is your thing, which only runs on windows.
I dunno.
I feel your pain though.
I also switched from windows to Mac OS in the past but I don’t feel like there is a shortage of Mac OS compatible software that would cause me to switch back.
I am using Photoshop since Version 4, currently i am working in an mixed environment – mostly Mac some Win-Workstations.
And it is a fact that all the Adobe Applications run way better under Windows then OS X.
If Apple is giving up on the Pro Community, why should a Company like Adobe not give up on the Mac?
I am sure – most if not all Adobe-Users will follow to Windows.
Since everybody else seems to be happy that the Mac is reduced to iOS-Functionallity – well there goes the Pro-Community and well there goes 50 % of Mac-Users.
Adobe photoshop runs perfectly on OS X.
Adobe isn’t abandoning OS.
Mac being 50% “pro” users?
PC seller not in decline, and MacBooks being their number 1, I doubt it very much.
I think normal people buy macs.
Aperture much.
Yeah, it was more powerful than iPhoto, but compared to Lightroom was pretty much useless for serious workflow.
Lack of support for color profiles being the most obvious.
Aperture supports color profiles very well, for editing and outputting.
So much for “the most obvious”.
You probably shoot jpegs with Auto White Balance.
Aperture supports printer profiles well enough, but try getting a camera profile into Aperture.
I’m not knocking Aperture, I use it, but for working “professional” photographers who shot RAW and care about color accuracy, Aperture doesn’t cut it.
Sorry, you’re making wrong assumptions about my shooting.
In any case, many professionals don’t bother with custom camera profiles, which are necessarily specific to one lighting condition.
For those whose focus is commercial or product photography, where exact color reproduction is a goal, yes, Aperture doesn’t support the necessary camera profiles.
I spent many hours researching both Aperture and LR.
I decided to go with Aperture as I’m a 30 year loyal Apple user and put my money on them improving Aperture and, in the meantime, I had my own workflow that got me around any Aperture limitations — slow processing of larger RAW files being one.
That said, obviously it was bad thinking on my part and I regret not going the LR route a few years back — especially since I already use a few of the other apps in Adobe’s suite.
Oh well, live and learn.
Prof.
I am pleased about the idea of this, but the screenshot is very depressing.
One of the main reasons a lot of folks didn’t switch to Aperture is the “all black, all the time” user interface.
I hope they at least give us a choice as to whether we want to live in this dark cave-like interface or whether we want to stay in the light.
From what I gather Aperture is a light UI and only goes black when you use full screen mode.
Prof.
I am pretty sure that Aperture has never had a light UI unless you think medium dark grey is “light” simply because it isn’t 100% black.
Aperture is the same shade as Safari.
I would call that fairly light, but to each their own.
Wow, you see no value in Aperture and you don’t like the dark interface.
That puts you at odds with a lot of folks whose taste and opinion I value, lol.
Ummm, like someone else said earlier, it appears you haven’t actually used Aperture, at least in a serious way.
You seem to have missed the Preferences > Appearance tab, which lets you independently control the lightness darkness of the Viewer, Full Screen Viewer, Browser, and Full Screen Browser.
The range of brightness ranges all the way from totally black to totally white.
I question your pro credentials.
LR UI is dark.
I’m almost on the cusp of wanting something more than iPhoto as a repository for my personal images.
Hope what replaces it is significantly more robust, because I’d rather not go with an Adobe solution.
I don’t think it’d be hard to be more robust than iPhoto at this point.
It’ll be interesting to see what gets cut from Aperture.
I imagine it’ll be to Aperture what iMovie 08 was to iMovie: Better UI and a feature cull of useful but lesser-used things, to be added later.
It ought to be a pretty dramatic upgrade for iPhoto users, though.
Next Year”, when next year?
It does make a big difference in your photo strategy.
I am completely undecided as to what to do next.
Move to Lightroom, and then I can’t convert.
Stay, and end up with a App.
I need.
Aperture has needed an update for sometime now.
I keep using it because I can bring it up in FCPX.
Apple says it is continuing development with that software but you get worried about that too.
When it comes to program software, Apple seems to start something and then move away and there is always a wait for an replacement and your never sure what it is going to until it is released.
Really hard to make a good business decision with the data provided.
According to TechCrunch, Apple will continue to provide compatibility updates to allow Aperture to run on OS X Yosemite, but development will stop.
Apple is also working with Adobe to create a transitionary workflow to help users shift to Lightroom.
Source?
Prof.
I was just thinking the reverse.
The iPhoto icon as well as the Aperture icon are so old and silly looking.
They look like something out of the 90′s.
I love the new colourful non-figurative, non-realistic icon and I hope it stays.
The cold hard reality is that Apple is a consumer products company now – has been since the iPod took off.
The new Photos app will not replace Aperture in functionality.
It’ll be closer to iPhoto, but not even that flexible.
It’s going to cater to the “snap and share” consumer crowd.
That’s why they’re working with Adobe to make it easy for professionals to switch to Lightroom.
Think iWork vs MS Office and you’ll get the idea.
Apple Computer to Apple Inc seven years ago, in 2007.
Work runs my company just fine.
I don’t need it.
This was predicted years ago – Adobe shipped LR before Aperture, was cheaper, had a much stronger community and continual updates.
Apple can’t be great at everything.
LR is even on iOS now.
WRONG.
Aperture was released in 2005.
Only the BETA of Lightroom was released in January 2006 with the final release in Februrary 2007.
You’re right, I definitely remember Aperture coming out before I even heard of Lightroom.
Could have used this with a route forward clearly in front of me.
I’ve over 50k photos in my Aperture Library.
Don’t want to lose that organisation, ratings, adjustments.
Presumably the new Photos app will take them on board.
I can’t face the workload of rebuilding all that in Lightroom, that’s quite apart from the pain in committing to an Adobe product.
Need to know more about Photos.
I am migrating to Lightroom as we speak.
So far it has not to bad to export Originals into folders named after projects, and then export versions the same way and input them all into Lightroom.
All of the metadata and Exif data comes over as well.
I’m confused.
A bit further down you say “so far it is a nightmare”.
First they release a Mac Pro without vetted storage solutions and now a Pro level tool is being phased out.
It may be the post PC era, but I was not ready for the post Mac era.
Mac – you DO NOT have my permission to die.
Prof.
The Mac is in no danger of dying.
Old-school photography is though.
Uh.
Wouldn’t be too sure about that.
Dying” may be a bit harsh but the tool as this user knowns and uses it will probably disappear sooner rather than later.
Apple just makes so much more money from iOS.
Sorry to inform you – if you remove the reason for having a truck, then nobody will buy them.
The Mac is being merged into iOS devices sooner than we think.
Further, iMovie 2013 was a disaster and is terrible for organizing home movie clips.
It messed up the dates on many MiniDV and AVCHD files.
If the Photos app follows this, it will be the worst tool ever.
As for”old” school photography, write me when you have reinvented optics  physics  with some new tech at a reasonable price.
WE ARE NOT MERGING IOS AND OS X” and what are you here crying about?
OS and OS X.
So you have to put all your photos in the Cloud.
No Thanks.
I guess I will be buying VM to run older version of Mac OS X.
People need to make this clear.
It is only matter of time when Syncing your iphone to your mac will be forbidden.
What makes you think you have to sync your photos to the cloud?
You don’t want to, don’t.
I’ve been storing all my photos  about 20 gigs  in both Google+ and Dropbox for a while now and it’s quite liberating.
But if I didn’t want to, I could just sync the photos over a wire to my Mac, and store them in a folder or any number of third-party apps.
Apple actually took away syncing of contacts, email, calendar from SyncServices for around 4 months.
Tunes Mavericks.
You could no longer sync your content the way you wanted to.
The only reason they didn’t do for photo and music is because icloud is not ready to flip the  switch but it is coming.
Writing is on the Wall.
Just like taking away RSS and then putting it back.
I don’t want to fight or complain to ceo just to get back functionality I use every day.
I rather use older versions.
Apple has not gotten the message that Cloud is tainted with NSA spying.
Shoving it down our throat just because it is convenient is not right.
This is horrible.
I have been a strong supporter of Aperture from day 1.
I am downloading Lightroom and migrating my library as we speak and so far it is a nightmare.
I am a die hard Apple fan, but this blow hurts.
That’s right @Wayner, listen to @kyron.
If you’re an avid photographer invested in Aperture you only have the minor disadvantage of migrating terabytes of data with the potential complete loss of every edit you’ve performed over the years.
As a bonus, you have to spend more money and learn a new photo editing suite.
Or you can use GrannyPhoto TM  by Apple  TM  that may or may not be offered next year, and whose details will only be announced to you when the execs at Apple finally decide on which designer jeans look the most “organic” and “tech-chill” for their speech at the keynote.

M.
O.
Or there’s always a chance to return to Media 1 Pro  formerly iView Media Pro .
I had used that extensively until Microsoft took it over and ruined it – and never even offer a Mac version of the pro version as far as I know.
Subsequently it was sold to Phase 1 and looks viable again.
I could be wrong but I feel that Capture One’s move to a Catalog system  like LR and Aperture  might spell the end of Media 1.
Media Pro’s still being developed.
It’s a more powerful, more general-purpose cataloging application compared to what’s now built into Capture One.
Phew.
So glad I picked Lightroom back in the day.
Adobe is much better in this arena, and I am just embarrassed to say I put faith in Apple when buying APERTURE in January.
Apple should offer refunds to those who purchased Aperture less than a year ago.
Their libraries will become obsolete, as will new camera RAW compatibility in less than a year.
You should have just installed the trial and opened up the Mac App Store.
Free upgrade!
And you know this how?
Perhaps Apple will continue to release Digital Camera Raw updates to OS X  which is how iPhoto and Aperture get support for new cameras .
And perhaps Apple will support a graceful migration of Aperture and iPhoto libraries to the new Photos application.
Not just about RAW support.
It’s about committing to a now extinct photo ecosystem.
That commitment is OVER for Aperture users.
Not sure what “Photos” will entail, but from all signs it appears to be photo software for the layman.
We’ve seen lots of speculation, but given that we do NOT know what the Photos application will offer, it’s simple FUD to say Apple’s photo ecosystem is extinct.
Apple should also build users like you a perch on their anus, so the proximity for ass kissing is minimized, for efficiency.
Jim, thank you for digging for an answer to this, and for sharing it with the community.
Much appreciated.
Would you mind clarifying where the screenshot you posted came from?
Or posting a higher res version of it?
That screenshot is very interesting, as it implies a lot more control possible with Apple’s new Photo’s app than was demoed at WWDC.
And I can’t find it anywhere on Apple’s site or PR material.
Will Apple provide at no cost increased iCloud storage capacity to cope with what will inevitably be large datasets ?
Doubt it.
But I equally doubt you’ll be forced to use iCloud for all your RAWs.
I probably have half a terabyte of RAW files in Aperture format.
No way I’m uploading all of that to iCloud.
A lot of conversion work for pro photogs.
This really sucks.
Apple says libraries will be able to migrate across to the new application when the application ships.
Apple is working with Adobe to offer a upgrade path to Lightroom.
Where did you hear that Apple is working with Adobe on a Lightroom upgrade path?
I would be interested in seeing that source.
I think the Techcrunch post listed above said that, since it now has an “update” saying it was removed in error.
On the other hand, Adobe seems almost certain to do such a thing, and doesn’t actually need Apple to actively help, does it?
I haven’t seen any quote from Apple indicating they were working with Adobe on anything.
Big difference.
Lightroom.
Used it ever since.
What a poorly handled announcement.
Wow.
I ran all Apple Pro apps for years  Logic, Aperture, Final Cut  and I’m sorry but this is real blow.
Apple, you do realize that if I sign up for Lightroom  notice I didn’t say “buy” because Adobe only rents now  I’ll get their pro video and audio apps too, right?
Why would I continue to use pay for your apps now that you’re forcing me to use your competition?
I’m not happy with Adobe’s scheme but since it doesn’t cost much more to use the whole master suite this transition may end my decade long relationship with Apple pro apps.
Nothing of the sort was stated in this story.
You can still buy Lightroom as a standalone product.
At least I did, last month.
Right now I can’t check because as usual their systems are down.
That’s to soften the transition to Creative Cloud and avoid having a ton of customers leave the platform.
No doubt their long term plan is to eventually force everyone to the service model once they feel they’re in a strong enough position to do so.
Apple’s abandonment of Aperture will only accelerate this.
I’ll get their pro video and audio apps too, right?
Well, I reckon they think that anyone using Adobe’s video workflow already ain’t using Final Cut – and that the people using Aperture mostly aren’t pro video editors, because that’s not a big market, is it?
And Adobe isn’t even competing in the same space as Logic, is it?
Audition appears to be for soundboard recording, not so much tracking.
Apple isn’t so desperate to keep your potential business with Final Cut that it’s going to keep Aperture going to keep you from maybe using an Adobe product and thinking that just maybe you want a CC subscription.
Just look at the screenshot.
Does that even remotely look like something that’s going to let you do what you did in Aperture?
This is not like when Apple updated Final Cut.
In that case they stated from the get go that it would still serve the pro market, and over time they added the features that were initially lost.
This is different.
Photos is clearly a desktop version of the iOS app.
While they will no doubt include some rudimentary editing features there’s no indication they aspire to make it a pro-level app.
I’m not one to judge an app by just one screenshot but if you brought it up, most of the editing panes found in Aperture are present in said screenshot.
I’m hopeful that there are preferences for adding and removing different panes  just like it is possible in Aperture today.
Nothing would make me happier than to be proven wrong.
Just look at the screenshot.
Well, the little row of icons in the upper right COULD allow you to switch views – and give all the equivalent views as Aperture.
As for the editing tools, well, there’s this thing called “scrolling” that could easily reveal numerous other tools….
I’m shocked at all the shock.
Aperture is inferior to Lightroom.
It wasn’t so in the beginning  I used Aperture for a while, it was the best in the beginning  but then Apple basically stopped developing it, where as Adobe moved right along.
The conversion from Aperture to Lightroom is a pain in the ass though, but I can’t blame Apple for killing an app they obviously don’t care about anyway.
While Lightroom may have some advantages over Aperture, it’s interface and workflows reek of everything that is wrong with everything Adobe.
Add the Creative Cloud software as a service subscription requirement, and Lightroom is a nonstarter for many of us who do not live in an Adobe bubble.
Aperture’s interface, usability, and image management features are far superior to any bloated crap Adobe has ever produced and for many its image editing capabilities were more than adequate.
I thought they still offered lightroom as a stand alone non-subscription product.
Again, I used both, so I think the exact opposite of what you’re saying, from experience.
I’m no adobe champion, I just found Aperture to be terrible in many ways, and it was clear that Apple had no interest in developing it any further.
I’d rather they use their man hours on other things.
That looks amazing!
If that were the case, why wouldn’t Apple just say so and spare themselves the negative backlash?
This sucks.
And the verbiage in Apple’s statement does not suggest they have any intention of including pro-level functionality in the new Photos app.
This will make a lot of otherwise loyal Apple customers think twice about embracing their technologies in the future.
Doesn’t make me feel very confident about investing in the new iCloud Drive, especially not with its stingy cost structure.
Well that does settle it.
Migrate Aperture libraries to Lightroom.
I hope Adobe feels free to make Lightroom’s interface more usable by borrowing some of Apple’s great ideas.
This is sad, but then it’s been tough keeping Aperture going when they have done so little to it.
Oh, and I hope Adobe gets a clue and starts really using the second GPU in the new Mac Pros.
I hope Adobe feels free to make Lightroom’s interface more usable by borrowing some of Apple’s great ideas.
It won’t.
Adobe doesn’t care about interface, to speak of.
What’re you going to do?
I just wanted to add my condolences.
Aperture spontaneously stopped working today, simultaneously.
I urge you to rush out and replace it right now, because there’s no possibility at all that Photos will do what you want.
When I tweeted a shorter version of this, someone actually asked if Aperture had really stopped working.
Exactly!
And all that stuff Apple told us about new APIs to allow plugins to operate DIRECTLY on RAW data, so the adjustments are EDITABLE?
Naaw, won’t help a bit.
When I tweeted a shorter version of this, someone actually asked if Aperture had really stopped working.
Oh double-f**ck me sideways.
000+ photo library to Aperture because of the iOS   iCloud integration and now you’re telling me I have to move it all back to $$$Adobe$$$ Lightroom and loose all the iCloud integration.
What makes you so sure Photos won’t do what you want?
There’s really no need to panic and move RIGHT NOW.
I know, I know.
But if it as much as comes close to iPhoto I won’t be able to use it.
I think wait and see is wise.
If it worked yesterday, it’ll probably work until Photos is released.
Then you can try Photos and move if you don’t like it.
Anyone who is telling you that you have to move it all back to Lightroom is spreading FUD.
Now to figure out how to get years’ worth of work into Lightroom.
I won’t be moving my work to the cloud.
Nope.
No way.
Why?
Did a cloud server kill your family?
Note that you assume iCloud is required, and possibly that somehow you don’t have a local library.
Why assume either of those?
As far as cloud photo storage goes, I would assume it will work similarly to iTunes Match.
I have all my music stored on my iMac’s hard drive, but it’s also accessible from any device through the cloud.
Any time I buy a song from any device, the iMac automatically grabs a copy and stores it locally.
Apple devices will go to the cloud and will be accessible from any of your devices, but you’ll also have the option to automatically download and store all those photos on one or more of your computers.
Sounds reasonable, and would be a good architecture.
But… I can’t help but take the analogy to a  silly  extreme.
You shoot a beautiful photo of the Grand Canyon using your iPhone 6S.
It magically syncs to the Apple Photos Match service.
But, just like iTunes Match, Apple notices it already has a similar photo of the Grand Canyon in the cloud, so no need to actually upload yours!
You would think that they would have announced a little more info about the new Photos app before announcing that Aperture is being end of lifed.
The fact that they didn’t  and that they are going to offer a “Lightroom” upgrade path  makes me worry.
I have been using Aperture for many years and my flow is set up around it … I don’t relish the thought of switching to Lightroom.
Where, exactly, is Apple QUOTED as saying they will offer a Lightroom upgrade path?
You’re right … I had read another article that talked about Apple helping with a migration path to Lightroom, but when I looked for it, it seems that the statement has since been retracted.
However, Adobe will of course offer an upgrade path.
I have a collection of perl scripts that extract all of the meta data from the Aperture library which is stored in SQLite format, so I don’t think it would be too hard for Adobe to do something similar.
This news really hurts if you just bought Aperture on the Mac App Store today for 80$ and to find out it is being dicontinued.
33 per month.
But it probably won’t drop dead that day.
If Photos is better, it’s like a free update to Aperture.
If Photos is worse, you’ll get to keep using Aperture.
I get what you mean emotionally, but rationally this is not so bad.
I’m hoping that Apple plans to make the new Photos app closer to Aperture’s capabilities than to iPhoto’s.
But if that’s not the case, the loss is worth a lot more than the purchase price of Aperture.
A lot of time goes into learning all the ins and outs of an application as rich as this and it would take a significant amount of time and effort to select and migrate to another product.
I purchased Aperture in order to have full control over the production of printed Apple photo books  as opposed to having to deal with pre-formatted styles in iPhoto .
With the elimination of Aperture, does this mean the full control is being eliminated?
Or will it be available in the new “Photos” app?
What about the photo books and video presentations.
We have a business built around these services!
LR as well.
FWIW, the TechCrunch article about this announcement also says that Apple will work with Adobe to help transition users to Lightroom.
Which implies that Photos will most likely not be addressing the full set of pro workflows.
TechCrunch changed the article.
The name Aperture doesn’t matter, what matters is the functionality.
Aperture and iPhoto already share a library format.
If this new unified app gives me the same editing sliders that I now have in Aperture, then this is a good news day – one unified app with cloud syncing and all the power of Aperture!
On the other hand, if all we get is the paltry few sliders iPhoto has, then this is a very sad day indeed.
Annoyingly, this article gives too little information to actually be of any use.
All it does it worry people, but without giving them any of the facts they need to know what this news actually means for them.
Well I could never decide between Lightroom or Aperture, guess that decision has been made now.
Apple was very clear when I spoke with them this morning that development on other pro apps like Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro is continuing.
The problem with this statement is Apple has made this or a similar announcement with the termination of other pro apps.
Repeatedly they prove that when it comes to pro apps, their word is meaningless.
Professionals make software decisions largely based on future support – and Apple, time and time again, is proving they cannot be relied on for professional level software.
I believe the new extensions architecture in iOS 8 is shared with Yosemite.
So, as they demoed in iOS 8, you could seamlessly invoke a 3rd party photo filter from within the Photos app.
If the same is true of the Photos app on Yosemite that could open it up to more pluggable integrated editing tools, replacing some of the edit functionality of Aperture.
That wouldn’t address the other features of Aperture that may not be replaced but it would help.
This could be HUGE!
Glad I jumped ship early.
It crawled on my machine anyway.
John C.
Apple, Adobe thanks you.
The writing was on the wall though.
Oh don’t worry, I probably won’t.
But I’m a pro, and Lightroom runs faster on PC.
I will wait and see how W9 looks.
If it’s W8-level ugly I’ll buy a used iMac, but Apple will not be getting another cent from me.
Lightroom runs like lightning on a capable machine  SSD, ram, etc .
2011 and still rocks.
What an ass.
Get a grip cretin.
Which is funny, because a Macintosh isn’t a capable machine.
They probably realize the features set is no longer competitive.
If it’s not competitive why do you think so many people are so upset to lose it?
The feature I like about Aperture is how easy it is to manage the Unified Library compared to catalogs magement in Lightroom.
And also how well the photos from selected Aperture Projects can easily be synced to my iPad using itunes.
I am really NOT A FAN OF MANDATORY CLOUD.
My humble opinion is that Apple will allow developers to add features to the Photos app through the new Extensions API.
Probably time for a do-over of both programs, and doing two going forward made no sense.
I was surprised Apple mentioned Photos in the WWDC Keynote given its 6-9 months away at best.
Really was no need to mention it.
All it did was raise questions.
Long wait time for an Apple product.
They either say nothing or tell us about a product we can’t get for a year….
TO WAIT!
Idiot.
Will Apple continue to provide and update the RAW formats for non-Apple cameras?
I’m going to store 75+GB of photos in iCloud?
Is Apple NUTS?
Never once have I desired to access a RAW workflow from my iPhone….
Calm down.
Breathe.
Apple is not updating Aperture any more.
Ya know what?
The version you have on your computer RIGHT NOW has been working fine for 2 years and will probably continue to work fine for another 5.
Sit tight and lets see what the Photos app is all about or if Apple has another game plan up its sleeve for pro photos.
Remember, all the RAW stuff is cooked right in to the OS, Aperture just allowed access to the Adjustments and had some nice cataloging features.
Calm, breathe, wait.
I wonder if Apple even realizes they punched us in the guts with this news.
Do they care about Mac users?
Why do we think they will continue FCP or Logic ?
Those apps will also get killed.
This is bad news.
I’m really upset.
I’m a Mac user, but I don’t give a shit about aperture.
Sad.
Truly sad.
I use Aperture regularly and love the advanced features as compared to iPhoto, which I are very limited.
I absolutely will not put an Adobe product on my Mac – they are gastly expensive, horrible, bloated and absolutely awful.
Even if Photos or whatever Apple’s next product is does everything that Aperture does today  which I seriously doubt given what was stated by Apple today and their other migrations such as iMovie and Final Cut  I will have to relearn everything I do.
If it doesn’t  far more likely  then I am left without a solution at all.
Seriously, if I have to use Adobe’s software I might as well get a cheap Windows machine to run it on and dive full into the pain and suffering – Adobe crapware runs better on Microsoft crapware anyway.
Isn’t that what they told Aperture users last year?
Sigh.
I don’t want my photos in the cloud.
Partly because I have way too much data for decent performance.
Partly because I don’t always have internet access.
Partly because some of it is private.
Partly because I don’t want to have to pay a monthly fee for the rest of my life to access my own stuff.
I want my stuff to be local, mine, and only mine.
Are there really no companies left that get this?
If you look at the price and how it has dropped over time, then it’s obvious that Aperture has never really taken off as a pro app.
The vast majority of users have to be amateurs.
While I find iPhoto a bit too limited and dumbed-down, I only use a rather small subset of Aperture’s functionality.
Moving to that new photo app may not be that bad, and better cloud integration is definitely a win.
Not sure how it’s going to work with large libraries, though.
Price of an app should not be the criteria to judge if an app is a Pro app.
This is a decision influenced by Apple’s increased popularity amongst general consumers.
In the past, even if nothing else were going well, Apple could count on creative pros like graphic artists and filmmakers, and they could count on Apple.
When Aperture was introduced, it was a natural extension of this partnership.
I was puzzled as Aperture began to atrophy from lack of attention from Apple, now I’m a little perturbed.
As much as I hate to say it, this appears to be one of those never-would-have-happened-on-Jobs’-watch decisions – abondoning Apple’s photographers to Adobe.
If I were a Logic or Final Cut user, I’d be nervous right now.
Aperture aswell gives me better image results compared to exports in a Lightroom test I once did.
Apple has so much potential with it’s Pro software division and should not abandon the creative users.
Tell to Apple, please, that here in Italy  Europe , with the slowest Internet connection in the Western world, it is absolutely useless to have photos in the cloud.
Jim D comes thru again.
With his true connections at Apple, one wonders why the rumormongers out there don’t check with him first before spreading unreliable news.
I primarily use Aperture after migrating from iPhoto a couple of years ago, but still go back and forth.
So, while I’ve become comfortable with Aperture, and don’t want to change, this new “merged” app  and I’m presuming better, more features  could be good.
If it integrates nicely with iCloud and photostream it may even get me back to using those, which are nice features.
My issue with icloud   photostream has always been storage.
Apple simply charges too much for too little storage.
I hope they address that as well.
I’ve become comfortable with Aperture, and don’t want to change” Then don’t!
It’s not like Aperture will stop working anytime soon.
I should have mentioned I do have LR as well, I’ve just been lazy.
Apple has given me the incentive I’ve needed.
Bottom line is, Aperture is just one piece of software, not the cure for world hunger.
This is pretty much the end of the line of me and Apple.
As a 30 year user, a person who convinced his school board to put in Apple labs instead of PC labs, who has sold millions of dollars of Apple equipment over the years, it’s time to say goodbye.
Those of us who were power users, who kept the company afloat during it’s lean years who’s goal was to produce results efficiently have been abandoned by the company.
They’ve become champions of fluff.
When they cancelled, idisk, I lost thousands of files.
I know Apple will say, I had lot’s of warning and it was my fault.
Well Apple that might be true.
I don’t care, the bottom line for me was I lost thousands of file.
I had to migrate two websites, I’ve since lost my iWeb files because of the stupid storage system built into iWeb.
With the loss of Aperture, Apple product is a hindrance to my work flow, not a help.
It’s hard to bleive that charging me $200 a year, Apple couldn’t make money doing what photobucket and godadday charge me less than $100 a year for.
The efficiency of product integration is gone, It’s not the company I signed up with 30 years ago.
They’ve become an expensive option that’s more complicated than it’s competition and really saves you nothing, if you know what you’re doing.
I guess it’s good for the great unwashed masses.
FileMaker, to continue development.
I like this.
We get the best of both worlds: simple, yet powerful.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t Apple  in their last year’s conference  use Apperture as one of the great examples of how the new Mac Pro can be used by professionals?
Now I don’t want to over-dramatise here, but if this means they’re abandoning the power user segment  and Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro will maybe follow soon , aren’t they contradicting their own statements and losing the edge they had over the PC platform?
If they’re moving away from being a premium brand and trying to become a mainstream company, then they need to also start introducing low-cost products and pretty much change their overall philosophy and I’m really not sure if this then isn’t the beginning of their end.
I’m slowly but steadily losing confidence in the Apple we all love.
Apple has recently been completely abandoning the professional market.
Just look at the new Final Cut Pro X, “improved” versions of iWork, and the discontinuation of Aperture.
Apple seems to be giving up on the pro market.
Software is being discontinued and the hardware is changing.
Just look at the new Retina MacBook “Pro”, non-upgradable Hard Drives, RAM, and battery.
Apple has completely abandoned the professional market, instead creating expensive devices that come with the same software as an iPad.
And that’s really a shame, because when you think about it, what reason will a professional photographer now have to actually buy a Mac device?
OK, Macs are still quality HW, but HW alone will not sell and we all know it and Apple should know that too.
Assuming Lightroom is cross-platform, I can see lots of their customers switching to PC instead.
Now if this trend continues and they’ll eventually abandon their remaining pro SW too, I think I will start to seriously question why they even introduced their new Mac Pro.
Apple don’t care about stuff, that don’t sell in very large scale.
I am certain, that the moment they have got enough users on iOS App’s, they stop all that has to do with OS X.
Both box’es and app’s.
A petty.
I don’t much like Windows and think it is hard work to deal with Adobe software.
Very disappointed to see Apple kill off yet another great tool  Aperture  I depend on.
And people wonder why I can’t get excited about iBooks Author or Swift.
If this matters to you, let Apple know.
Can’t hurt, may help more than anything posted here or anywhere else.
I won’t hold my breath.
I’ve been an Aperture user since the beginning.
While I understand the technology and cost issues  some of which is Apple’s fault for neglect ; my major issue is the cowardly way this was announced.
This is how rumours start.
This is spreading across the net and I’d like to see your source.
This doesn’t seem very Apple to just go and announce the end of development of Aperture to ONE news outlet.
I’ll believe it when I see the source or the press release.
The introduction of the Mac Pro pretty much proves that Apple isn’t giving up on their pro market.
For me is a very big mistake leave Aperture because is one of the best photography application.
Is true that in Windows we will find better ones, but of course much more expensive, and this is one indication that demonstrates that Apple cares and wants to mantain the profesional target.
In audio, photo or video edition and more.
I hope that Photos will improve in all Aperture and mantain the professional status that Apple wants.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t Apple  in their last year’s conference  use Apperture as one of the great examples of how the new Mac Pro can be used by professionals?
Now I don’t want to over-dramatise here, but if this means they’re abandoning the power user segment  and Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro will maybe follow soon , aren’t they contradicting their own statements and losing the edge they had over the PC platform?

0.
I hope to get the site caught up over the course of the next couple of months, rather than as a single monolythic update.
Thanks to everyone for their continued support!
Oops!
I forgot to properly sunset the various Macs capable of running OS X Lion but not OS X Mountain Lion.
Thanks to Joshua Long for pointing it out !
I added the Apple TV , iPad  Retina  , new MacBook Airs   11-inch , 13-inch  , new MacBook Pros   13-inch , 15-inch , Retina  ,   ahem   newish Mac Pros   Single CPU , Dual CPU  , and a couple of missing iMac education-only models.
Made a few minor under-the-hood improvements.
This may be the only update until early 2013, though I ll try to be timely adding the new iPhone and whatever else gets announced in September.
Welcome to the new apple-history!
I ve been slowly building the new UI over the past year, making slow but steady progress toward what you now see here.
The frames-based site was nearly nine years old, and long overdue for a major rework, and I finally had time to finish it up during the holidays.
I hope you love  or can at least tolerate  the new site!
Complete re-skin!
My goal was a clean, simple site that didn t feel completely foreign.
The core layout of each page should still look familiar.
I ve made an attempt to test this on as many browsers as I can, but there will inevitability be some kinks to iron out.
Please be patient!
No more frames!
I struggled for a long time with how to make every page of the site easily accessible from every other page, and for a long time frames was the best answer I had.
After years of experimentation, I think I ve found a reasonable solution in the new navigation column you see to your left.
It should  remember  its state from screen to screen, and default to a reasonable state when pages are loaded from links or bookmarks.
It uses very simple javascript and css, and should degrade nicely to a simple bulleted list for simple browsers.
Removing frames has the added benefit of making bookmarking much easier.
Short URLs!
As you click around the site, you ll notice that the URLs are much shorter.
The old-style URLs should all still work fine, but will redirect to the new shorter ones, which should get picked up by the search engines over the next few weeks.
Tweet +1 buttons on ever page!
I added tweet buttons to the old site a few months ago, but I think the integration is a little cleaner now.
There s also a follow button up top so you can get a tweet whenever I manage to update the site.
Model Comparison improvements!
The comparison tables are a little better integrated with the rest of the site visually.
The pull-down menu is still there, but has been augmented to also behave as an auto-complete search field.
I find this makes comparing models pretty easy.
I ve also added the iPhone 4S, the late  11 MacBook Pros, and fixed a few small specs errata.
I believe I ve worked out all of the major bugs in the new site, but there s still a lot to do, which I hope to get to over the course of the next year.
The standard caveat still applies, though: I work a busy, full time job, and updates to the site may still be several months removed from one another.
Thanks for visiting!
Holy Moly!
I could list all the models I m adding, but it s basically 2010 and 2011.
My newish-job at Twitter keeps me pretty busy, but I ve been hacking away as time allows, and am finally up to date, with a number of small corrections as well.
Thanks to all the folks who have emailed to check in and make sure I m still here.
I intend to keep the site up, running, and mostly current for the forceable future, though I ll probably continue to be a few months behind most of the time.
I ve also been working on a larger structural update to the site, which didn t make the cut for this release, but I hope to get out by the end of the year  along with whatever new machines get released in the interim .
I ve added a follow button to the site navigation for the @apple_history Twitter account, from which I will tweet when ever I make up an update in the future.
Added the new MacBook and MacBook Pro models, added the iPhone 4.
Fixed a few typos.
Mac  Late 2009 , and added the Mac mini  Late 2009 , which I had mostly added already.
Happy  one month after  New Year!
Added the Late 2009 models and the iPad.
Made more smallish, not all that apparent under-the-hood changes.
Within hours of launching the comparison feature I managed to break it in attempt to fix bookmarking  which had been broken for comparison pages .
Both work now.
Thanks Matthias!
Boy oh boy, it s been a while, hasn t it?
Nearly a year!
Thanks Sorry to all those who wrote in to ask if I was dead, and even more thanks to those of you who didn t!
I m not dead, I haven t forgotten about or given up on the site, and I do intend to bring it up to date and improve it over time.
Now that we ve gotten that out of the way: the site has been updated with all the 2009 models, and has had some major under-the-hood renovations to increase stability, scalability, and to aid in future feature enhancements.
As proof that all that pretty much invisible under-the-hood work was worth something, I ve added a new feature, which allows you to compare up to four models side by side.
Every model page now has a pull-down menu listing all other models, and a  compare  button.
Once you get past the initial annoyance at the list being so darn long, it s easy as pie!
You can add a model to the comparison with the same pull-down menu, and you can remove a model by clicking  REMOVE.  I intend, at some point, to come up with something better than a 340-item pull down menu, but I had to get the update out before 2010.
In addition to yet another round of corrections, I ve also updated a bunch of the images for older models, thanks to the very generous folks at Old Computers  a really great collection of 70 s and 80 s computers  and Todo Apple Blog .
I figure We ve got a few weeks before the site goes out of date again, so enjoy!

I m not even sure we can call it a watch.
Okay, it goes on the wrist, and it happens to tell the time, but that s about where the similarities between Apple s just announced watch and the hand-assembled, often painstakingly finished mechanical watches we write about, and obsess over, end.
I was lucky enough to be invited to Cupertino to witness the announcement of the Apple Watch firsthand, and though I do not believe it poses any threat to haute horology manufactures, I do think the Apple Watch will be a big problem for low-priced quartz watches, and even some entry-level mechanical watches.
In years to come, it could pose a larger threat to higher end brands, too.
The reason?
Apple got more details right on their watch than the vast majority of Swiss and Asian brands do with similarly priced watches, and those details add up to a really impressive piece of design.
It offers so much more functionality than other digitals it s almost embarrassing.
But it s not perfect, by any means.
Read on to hear my thoughts on the Apple Watch, from the perspective of a watch guy.
Oh, and there are dozens of in-the-metal pictures, too.
Instead, I ve chosen to focus on the many things I believe Apple got right and those I believe they got wrong, all the while viewing this piece of wearable technology not as a digital peripheral, but as an actual watch.
Essentially, what our friends in Switzerland can learn from Apple, and what Apple can learn from the Swiss.
The overall level of design in the Apple Watch simply blows away anything – digital or analog – in the watch space at $350.
There is nothing that comes close to the fluidity, attention to detail, or simple build quality found on the Apple Watch in this price bracket.
The Sistem51, for example, is a very cool, inexpensive mechanical watch.
But it feels like it costs $150  for the record, I bought one and adore it .
Then, for closer to the price of the Apple Watch, you could own this , which is, well, downright horrific in just about every conceivable metric.
Seiko does offer some nice things at $349 or less, but again, they feel like they cost exactly what they do.
The Apple Watch feels like a lot of thought went into it, and no doubt it did.
It feels expensive.
Overall design of the object – most obviously, the way that curved screen flows perfectly into the case – is just gorgeous.
As Tim Cook said during the keynote address, you can barely tell where the software stops and the hardware begins.
The rounded edges are very Apple, even very Marc Newson, who, based on absolutely nothing but a gut feeling, I m sure had something to do with the design of the Apple Watch.
Why?
Just look at it.
Also, take a read of this article I wrote back in 2012 when Newson s Ikepod showed its then new Horizon.
I call attention to the fact that the bezel is seamlessly integrated into the case.
Not dissimilar to the way the screen of the Apple Watch wraps into the body.
And the strap found on the Apple Watch Sport ?
Look at the strap from the Newson-designed Ikepod .
Jony Ive s friendship with Newson is well documented and it s possible they simply shared ideas over drinks, or maybe Newson was entrenched in the project, imparting all he learned at Ikepod with his friends at Apple prior to the announcement he d join their ranks.
We will never know.
The Apple Watch is available in both 38 mm and 42 mm.
I tried them both on, and they both worked perfectly on my wrist.
They didn t exaggerate the options and make one decidedly male oriented at 44 mm and a girly equivalent at 35 mm or the like.
Any man, woman, or child could pull off either size with ease.
This may not seem like much, but remember this is Apple s first watch, and it would be a very easy mistake to make it too big or too small.
I m sure there was much discussion about making it larger – how could there not be?
It would ve made the entire interface bigger, bolder, more recognizable from afar and easier to use.
The fact that they chose to actually make the thing wearable shows a great deal of restraint.
The 38 mm example is particularly nice on the wrist, as seen here.
The Apple Watch, in its own way, really pays great homage to traditional watchmaking and the environment in which horology was developed.
We have to remember that the first timekeeping devices, things like sundials , were dictated by the sun and the stars, as is time to this day.
The fact that Apple chose to develop two faces dedicated to the cosmos shows they are, at the very least, aware of the origins and importance of the earliest timekeeping machines, and the governing body of all time and space – the universe.
Sidenote: this  Astronomy  face will make it super easy to set the moonphase on your perpetual calendar.
Apple will also offer a few faces that are reminiscent of modern analog watches.
Further, they kept the crown.
Okay, so it s a  digital crown  on the Apple Watch, but for a company founded by a man known for his distaste of buttons and switches, the fact that they kept the original horological control center says something.
There are so many different variations on the Apple Watch it s hard to keep it all straight.
There is the normal Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport, and the Apple Watch Edition.
That means it s cased in steel, DLC-coated steel, aluminum, grey DLC-coated aluminum, rose gold or yellow gold.
Does that mean there is an Apple Watch for everyone?
No, it doesn t, but it reinforces Cook s message that this is Apple s most personal device, offering a range of options that can fit someone s varying lifestyle.
No watch from Switzerland comes with this many choices of finishes, and in a world where every industry is splitting hairs  I m looking at you, BMW 4, 6, and 8 series   and you, Audi A2, A3, A5, and A7 , it only makes sense to offer the chance for people to obsess of the details.
Details are what make life interesting – it s what allows me, for example, to have a job writing about something that we literally do not need in any capacity, but enjoy a great deal.
I guarantee that there are a very high number of people out there who just adore the standard Apple Watch, and hate the Apple Watch Sport.
Similarly for the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition, because though it received over 2,000 likes on Instagram , many of the comments were quite negative.
I think Switzerland should take a clue here, and realize that once you find something that works, it doesn t hurt to offer it in any number of aesthetic options.
Consider how robust our straps business in on the HODINKEE shop – that is because watch consumers simply didn t like having only the OEM-supplied strap or bracelet as an option.
We re starting to see the slight deviation model a little bit from the Swiss, an example being the Tudor Black Bay, which comes with a burgundy bezel and gilt dial , or blue bezel with silver dial , each with three strap options.
And that leads me to my next point.
Apple absolutely, positively, indisputably NAILED its straps and bracelets.
In addition to offering a bevy of options from leather to fluoroelastomer to link bracelets to Milanese, it is here that you really see how much attention Apple was paying to the way people wear watches, and the how bad existing options were.
The Apple Watch can take an integrated strap or bracelet, or one with wire lugs.
It totally changes the look of the watch, and swapping them couldn t be any easier.
Changing straps is one thing, but the attention to detail on the straps and bracelets themselves is downright incredible, and when I mentioned above that nothing comes close in this price range, it is very visible when talking about straps.
I mentioned the Ikepod style closure of the Sport watch straps above, which is clearly just a superior way of closing a strap like that.
But, it gets better.
The leather is super soft, super high quality.
It is much nicer than any leather strap I ve ever felt on a $350 analog watch.
Then, look at the buckle.
It looks like a normal tang, but notice that the tang itself doesn t simply sit on top of the crossbar – it s actually integrated into the buckle itself.
Then you have the link bracelet.
Did you know that the entire thing is sizable with just your own hands, no tools required?
All you have to do it press on the center link from the rear of the bracelet and a link pops right out.
It reminds me a little bit of how IWC s Aquatimer straps attach to the case, with a center release button, but here it s for every single link.
Additionally, the deployant  did you notice Jony Ive called it a  deployment  buckle in the video?
But for me, it s all about the Milanese bracelet, baby.
The fact that Apple even knows what this is is remarkable.
I promise you not a single other tech company in the world would ve spent the time to make this admittedly outdated looking option.
But I absolutely love it.
I love it because it s so comfortable, so different than a traditional link bracelet.
I love it because it s so 1950s and  60s.
I actually wear a Milanese-style bracelet on my 1957 Omega Speedmaster  ref.
2915-2 for you nerds  and I get more compliments on it than just about anything I own, because of the bracelet.
The 42 mm Apple Watch on this bracelet was the one I was determined to try on first, and here it is on my wrist.
This  loop  style bracelet is just fantastic, and unlike the bracelet on my Omega, it just works.
It s magnetized and you can close it at any size.
It is light to wear, but substantial, and feels fantastic on the wrist.
How does it compare to this nice Tissot with a similar bracelet ?
Switzerland, you don t want to know.
Again, Apple has paid excruciating attention to detail in the design and wearability of the Apple Watch.
In many cases, its offerings make what is coming out of Switzerland  or Asia  look amateurish.
But, let me remind you that I am looking at this object as just that, the physical form, not in the interface.
If this was simply a digital watch, I could say it s a well designed, well-executed one.
But it s not a watch, and that s where I think it missed the mark.
What surprised me the most about the introduction of a large ish  device, complete with a screen and not simply a wearable, is that it shows Apple is comfortable not having its object worn by a significant percentage of early adopters who normally flock to their launches.
Those who love, and wear, mechanical watches tend to be in a slightly higher income bracket.
They tend to want things that are beautifully made with great purpose – in a nutshell, Apple products.
But what makes the millions of us who would never trade a Rolex in for an Apple is the emotion brought about by our watches – the fact that they are so timeless, so lasting, so personal.
Nothing digital, no matter if Jony Ive  or Marc Newson  designed it, could ever replace that, if for no other reason than sheer life-cycle limitations.
My watches will last for generations; this Apple Watch will last for five years, if we re lucky.
On an emotional level, you can t compare them, and that is why I don t believe many serious watch lovers  who, again, would normally be racing to spend their cash on an Apple release  will go for this.
It s directly competing for the same real estate, whereas if we had seen a bracelet of some kind announced yesterday, those early adapters, myself included, would be begging Apple to take their pre-pre-pre-order  truth be told, I ll obviously be buying one, but you know what I m saying .
If I had to criticize the actual form of the Apple Watch, it would be a complaint you ve heard from me before   most recently with the Habring2 in our latest Three on Three  ; the Apple Watch doesn t fit under my shirt cuff without serious effort, if at all.
I believe that great design should not disrupt daily life, and a watch that doesn t fit under a shirt sleeve is missing something.
Apple is amazing at building thin, elegant machines, and I was surprised by how bulky this is, especially when the 45 minutes prior to the introduction of the Apple Watch were spent discussing how svelte the new iPhone 6 is.
I understand the physical limitations and the required dock on the rear of the watch, but the Apple Watch is bulkier than I would ve liked.
Could I have likely figured out a better solution for all that went into the Apple Watch to make it thinner?
Certainly not, but to get mass adoption, I think it needs to be sleeker.
And about that.
The Apple Watch is an incredible piece of engineering, no doubt.
It is still not as cool as a mechanical watch, to real people.
This might change with time, but my feeling is that not any time soon will a digital wristwatch, no matter what it s capable of, be considered  cool.   I am talking pure aesthetics, and 100 percent superficial judgement here, but at the end of the day, I don t see people that love beautiful things wearing this with any great regularity.
Imagine a man who grew up in the middle class, went do a decent school, got an okay job, lives in a nice apartment in some metropolitan town, maybe drives a German car and occasionally splurges on something nice for himself.
Do you see him wearing the Apple Watch?
I don t.
I do see him buying the Apple Watch, but it will need to go further than that.
Take me, for example, I am sitting here on a gorgeous 27-inch iMac, wearing an ultra-thin perpetual calendar in white gold, and in fact, to my left is an Ikepod Hourglass  designed by Marc Newson  that I wanted from the minute I laid eyes on it.
I saved up and bought it because it s a perfect object, and even those people who don t care about time, or design, agree that it s beautiful.
The average well-to-do person buys an iPhone 6 because it s the absolute best offering in the category in both form and function.
I m not sure the same can be said about the Apple Watch because things like my Patek Philippe 3940G exist, and they always will.
The biggest concern those in the mainstream press have with the actual functionality of the Apple Watch is that it must be tethered to an iPhone.
Does that mean, if you were to go for a jog, that the iPhone has to come with?
During yesterday s hands-on session we asked that directly to Apple PR, and they didn t have an answer at that moment.
If so, that s a problem, but one I expect to be remedied quickly, if even a valid concern at all.
The Apple Watch is absolutely the best smartwatch on the planet.
That much I m sure of.
But are we sure that wearable technology is something we really want?
In the same way those who publicly wore bluetooth headsets five years ago and those who wore Google Glass one year ago, will smartwatches ever become a thing that people genuinely want?
If anyone can make it happen, it s Apple.
Is It A Threat To  Real  Watches?
This a question I ve been asked countless times in the media of the past few months     days   hours .
Will anyone be trading in their Lange Double-Split for an Apple Watch?
Certainly not.
But, will the average Lange owner buy an Apple Watch, wear it on the weekends, and then, after a great workout with it, decide to leave it on next for a vacation to the beach, and then maybe on casual Friday to the office?
It s possible.
Apple products have a way of making someone not want to live without them, and while I wasn t able to fully immerse myself in the OS yesterday, what I saw was impressive.
So while certainly not direct competition for haute horology watchmaking right now, the Apple Watch is absolutely competition for the real estate of the wrist, and years down the road, it could spell trouble for traditional watches even at a high level.
When you realize you just don t need something anymore, there is little desire to buy another.
At the lower end, I believe the Apple Watch is a serious threat to those less faithful lovers of analog watches.
There is a certain percentage of the population that simply doesn t care if they re wearing a watch of any great manufacturing process and the Apple Watch will appeal to them, if it works as advertised.
Brands like Suunto should be worried.
Casio as well.
Even Seiko with its Astron line could fall into the same group of those looking for pure function.
The other thing that could spell trouble even for the Swiss is Apple s cool factor with the young.
At 16, will someone want a Swatch or an Apple watch?
At 20, will they want a Hamilton or the Apple Watch 3?
At 25 will they want an Omega or an Apple Watch Plus?
That should be a very real concern for the Swiss – appealing to a younger generation of buyers who live and breathe Apple.
Again, Apple paid great attention to detail with this new wrist-bound peripheral, and it shows the Swiss that it is possible to have great design at low costs.
That is the most exciting thing about the Apple Watch for me – it will push the Swiss to take the sub-$1,000 mechanical watch category more seriously.
The Apple Watch is slated to ship in early 2015, and you can be sure we ll put its through its paces once available.

A screenshot from Apple s announcement of Apple Pay.
Alongside the iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch this afternoon, Apple Apple also unveiled the Apple Pay, the company’s attempt to do what Google Google could not and replace your wallet with your phone.
Though many predicted the announcement of an Apple mobile payment platform, the Apple Pay arrives with a little less buzz than the iPhone 6 and certainly less glamour than the Apple Watch, and perhaps for good reason: its debut comes as conversations over digital security have reached a fevered pitch after  yet another retailer confirmed a data breach  and two weeks after an iCloud hack that exposed nude images of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton .
And, not to mention, it arrives in the wake of eBay’s “One Touch PayPal” and Venmo Touch, which some analysts think can withstand the threat from Apple.
Apple Pay will use a credit card from your iTunes account or one that’s been added by using the “iSight” camera, and will allow consumers to pay for things by Touch ID.
Apple says that each transaction will be authorized with a one-time, unique number, creating a security code that it says is more secure than the one on the back of your credit card because cashiers won’t see your name, card number or security code.
The service will work with the three major payment networks — American Express, MasterCard and Visa — and Apple said that there are 220,000 merchant locations that accept these contactless payments.
Apple Pay’s technology echoes — and now competes with — that of eBay’s PayPal, which in August unveiled its “One Touch PayPal,” a service that allows consumers to pay for goods  at participating merchants  with one touch of the PayPal app.
Apple will use what is known as near-field communication  NFC , a technology that enables people to pay for their things by waving or tapping their phone near  or on  a payment terminal.
Passbook, Maps .
And, as it relates to PayPal, it still has the massive Android platform to innovate on,” he wrote.
What’s more, May calculated that based on factors like the iOS market share and PayPal’s average take rate, less than one half of one percent of PayPal’s revenue is at risk from Apple Pay.
4% of its overall revenue.
Meanwhile, if Apple Pay encourages consumer migration to mobile payments in general, and not just Apple, May says that PayPal could record nearly $15 billion in NFC-based payment volume by 2017.
Apple’s only hurdle to wide-scale iPhone-payment domination isn’t just eBay — there’s consumer sentiment it has to overcome.
62% of Americans “never” or “hardly ever” use their phones to make a purchase, and many say that they will never, ever use their phone to pay for something: 49% of adults ages 50 to 64 don’t plan on it and  unsurprisingly  64% of adults 65 or older have no interest in swapping their wallet for their smartphone.
Even in the youngest, tech-savvy set — the millennial generation — 30% of respondents said they wouldn’t use their phone to make a purchase.
I was surprised with how many folks said never.

Schulz pointed to the recent digital security breaches like the Home Depot debit card breach and the leaking of nude images of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton as contributing factors to consumers’ reticence to adopt mobile payment behavior.

If Apple Pay is the future, the future won t be here any time soon.
On Monday, Apple turned the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus into a virtual wallet with an update to iOS.
With Apple Pay, you snap a photo of your credit card and your iPhone stores it virtually on a special chip inside.
You can then use it to pay for stuff in stores.
It worked almost flawlessly in my tests.
But the problem with Apple Pay isn t the mechanics and ease of use, it s that you likely won t have much of an opportunity to try it at first.
Over the last several days, only a few stores I visited in San Francisco had the special NFC payment pads necessary to accept Apple Pay.
Yes, major stores like Whole Foods, Walgreens, and Panera Bread all accept Apple Pay, but the vast majority of retailers do not.
Apple says there are over 200,000 Apple Pay-ready retail locations, but that s just a sliver of the retailers in the US.
Since Apple Pay launched, I ve eaten in restaurants, bought groceries, gone out to bars, added money to my BART ticket, and just generally engaged in everyday commerce.
I think I was only able to use Apple Pay three times.
And one of those times was when I purposefully went to Walgreens so I could test Apple Pay on launch day.
From the beginning, Apple Pay was marketed as a way to replace your wallet.
That might happen one day, but until it s as ubiquitous as credit card terminals, you re still going to need carry both your wallet stuffed with cards and cash along with your iPhone.
Meanwhile, there s some evidence that retailers are blocking Apple Pay payments, even though they have the pads designed to accept it.
On Saturday, we learned that Rite Aid and CVS seemed to be blocking Apple Pay .
It sounds like both those stores have plans to roll out their own mobile payments system.
The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that Best Buy doesn t plan to accept Apple Pay for a similar reason.
I m also not convinced Apple Pay is easier than swiping a credit card.
During the iPhone 6 launch event in September, Apple showed a video where a woman had to fumble around with her credit card before she could swipe it.
In an alternative scenario, she just takes out her iPhone and taps it on a pad.
The demo felt exaggerated and forced, a solution in search of a problem.
It s not difficult at all to swipe a card.
APThe Apple Pay demo made using a credit card seem difficult.
In fact, depending on the type of terminal, the transaction might not be as seamless as Apple showed in its demo.
For example, the payment pad at Walgreens prompted me to enter a PIN and requested a donation to some charity before the transaction would go through.
It ll get better, and I m not ready to call Apple Pay a dud this early.
More retailers will get NFC payment pads over time.
And while Apple Pay works with most major credit cards, there are still a lot from smaller banks that don t work yet that have to get on board.
I bet the allure of being tied to a brand like Apple will entice a lot more retailers and banks who want to appear on the cutting edge to join.
Plus, Apple Pay has the potential to be a lot more secure than normal credit cards.
If your card is lost or stolen, there s nothing stopping someone from swiping away before you call your credit card company and cancel.
Apple Pay requires a fingerprint to work, so unless a thief is able to steal your hand along with your iPhone, he s pretty much out of luck.
But for now, Apple Pay is just a minor convenience, a geeky-cool way to buy stuff until it and other payment systems are as widely accepted as regular old credit cards.

Apple has updated its privacy policy as part of the rollout of iOS 8, announcing that devices with the latest version of the operating system installed can no longer be accessed by the company itself.
Previously, as we reported in May 2014 , if law enforcement came to Apple with a seized device and a valid warrant, it was able to access a substantial portion of the data already on an iPad or iPhone.
But under the latest version of iOS, even that will be impossible.
On devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages  including attachments , email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode,  the company wrote on its website Wednesday evening.  Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data.
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.
In an open letter also published Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook took a direct swipe at Google, its primary mobile competitor.
Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products.
We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers,  he wrote.  We don’t ‘monetize’ the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud.
And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you.
Our software and services are designed to make our devices better.
Data Protection FTW!
The specific technical changes seem to be outlined in a new 43-page document entitled   iOS Security Guide September 2014 ,  the company’s perfunctory list of changes for each new version of iOS.
The previous version of this document, dated February 2014 , referred to the company’s hardware-based proprietary file and keychain protection mechanism called Data Protection, which uses 256-bit AES key and then encrypts every new file created.
Now, however, that section of the September 2014 document specifically refers to Messages, Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and Photos, which suggests that Apple has significantly expanded what data on the phone is encrypted.
By setting up a device passcode, the user automatically enables Data Protection.
OS supports four-digit and arbitrary-length alphanumeric passcodes.
In addition to unlocking the device, a passcode provides entropy for certain encryption keys.
This means an attacker in possession of a device can’t get access to data in specific protection classes without the passcode.
The passcode is entangled with the device’s UID, so brute-force attempts must be performed on the device under attack.
A large iteration count is used to make each attempt slower.
The iteration count is calibrated so that one attempt takes approximately 80 milliseconds.
This means it would take more than 51⁄2 years to try all combinations of a six-character alphanumeric passcode with lowercase letters and numbers.
There are a few other privacy-minded changes as well.
It also mentions that when an iOS 8 device is not associated with a Wi-Fi network, and the processor is asleep, the device uses a randomized Media Access Control address.
Finally, Apple also highlighted a new secure addition in Mail.
Apple wrote.

It was at CES in June 1978, that Steve Jobs eagerly dragged me into the Apple booth and showed me the tiny disk controller card for the Apple ][.
He was so excited, and so proud of Woz s engineering achievement, that he could not contain his excitement.
He was ecstatic at the simplicity of the design and how few chips were on that board.
To truly appreciate the marvel of it, compare it to the SOL Helios drive, packed with TTL logic and delivered about a year late.
Somewhere in my storage locker, I have a complete disassembled and commented version of Apple DOS from 1978.
It will be interesting to dig that out and compare.
VisiCalc accessed the disk through the low level routines to improve performance.
That code was all based on the disassembled version of DOS we had back then.
Later, VisiDex accessed the disk directly and achieved a speed several times faster than DOS read and write by accessing sectors non-sequentially based on the position of the read write heads after processing the data.
I don t recall if it was alternate sectors or some other formula.
As I recall, the original DOS file copy routine read one sector, moved the head and wrote one sector, which probably didn t make much difference on floppies, which were already slow.
But when Corvus introduced a hard drive for the Apple ][, which was transparent, so you could watch the head go back and forth, it inspired me to write an efficient file copy program that made maximum use of available memory.
Apple DOS is like an old friend.
I spent many happy hours burning the midnight oil exploring the code, byte by byte.

NUTRITIONAL TARGET MAP™ The Nutritional Target Map™ allows you to see at a glance how foods line up with your nutritional and weight-management goals.
The closer a food is to the right edge of the map, the more essential nutrients per calorie it contains.
For a more nutritious diet, select foods that fall on the right half of the map.
The closer a food is to the top edge of the map, the more likely it is to fill you up with fewer calories.
If you want to restrict your caloric intake without feeling hungry, choose foods from the top half of the map.
Foods that are close to the bottom edge are more calorie-dense.
If you want to increase your calorie intake without getting too full, choose foods from the bottom half of the map.

The good: This food is very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium.
It is also a good source of Dietary Fiber and Vitamin C.
The bad: A large portion of the calories in this food come from sugars.
CALORIC RATIO PYRAMID™ This graphic shows you what percentage of the calories in a food come from carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol.
If you are trying to achieve a specific distribution of calories, such as the 40 30 30 distribution of the Zone™ diet, or the more traditional 60 30 10 distribution, the Caloric Ratio Pyramid™ will show you how recipes, meal plans, or individual foods line up with those goals.
Foods low in fat, for example, will cluster along the bottom edge of the pyramid, ranging from foods that are high in carbohydrates  at the left edge  to foods that are high in protein  at the right edge .
Foods low in carbohydrates will cluster along the right edge of the pyramid, with foods that are high in fat at the upper edge and foods that are high in protein at the lower edge.
Foods that have roughly the same number of calories from fats, calories, and protein will be found closer to the center of the pyramid.

ESTIMATED GLYCEMIC LOAD™ Glycemic load is a way of expressing a food or meal s effect on blood-sugar levels.
Nutrition Data’s patent-pending Estimated Glycemic Load™  eGL  is available for every food in the database as well as for custom foods, meals, and recipes in your Pantry.
How to interpret the values: Experts vary on their recommendations for what your total glycemic load should be each day.
A typical target for total Estimated Glycemic Load is 100 or less per day.
If you have diabetes or metabolic syndrome, you might want to aim a little lower.
If you are not overweight and are physically active, a little higher is acceptable.

NUTRIENT BALANCE INDICATOR™ This symbol offers a visual representation of a food s nutritional strengths and weaknesses, with each spoke representing a different nutrient.
The spoke for dietary fiber is colored green, protein is blue, vitamins are purple, minerals are white, and yellow represents a group of commonly overconsumed nutrients: saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
A Completeness Score between 0 and 100 is a relative indication of how complete the food is with respect to these nutrients.
Although few  if any  individual foods provide all the essential nutrients, the Nutrient Balance Indicator and Completeness Score can help you construct meals that are nutritionally balanced and complete.
This feature requires Flash player to be installed in your browser.

PROTEIN QUALITY Protein quality is dependent on having all the essential amino acids in the proper proportions.
If one or more amino acid is not present in sufficient amounts, the protein in your diet is considered incomplete.
Each spoke on the Protein Quality graph represents one of the nine essential amino acids, and the graph shows how close the protein in your diet is to the optimal distribution of amino acids recommended by the Institute of Medicine s Food and Nutrition Board.
An Amino Acid Score of 100 or higher indicates a complete or high-quality protein.
If the Amino Acid Score is less than 100, a link is provided to complementary sources of protein.
By combining complementary proteins, you may be able to increase the overall quality of the protein you consume.

All foods, regardless of their rating, have the potential to play an important role in your diet.
The Amino Acid Score has not been corrected for digestibility, which could reduce its value.
NUTRITION DATA S OPINION Nutrition Data awards foods 0 to 5 stars in each of three categories, based on their nutrient density  ND Rating  and their satiating effect  Fullness Factor™ .
Foods that are both nutritious and filling are considered better choices for weight loss.
Foods that are nutritious without being filling are considered better choices for healthy weight gain.
Foods that have more essential nutrients per calorie are considered better choices for optimum health.
Nutrition Data also indicates whether a food is particularly high or low in various nutrients, according to the dietary recommendations of the FDA.

Apple finally made its big entry into the wearable technology market on Tuesday, unveiling the Apple Watch, its long-anticipated smartwatch.
It’s the next chapter in Apple’s story,” declared Apple CEO Tim Cook during a packed event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino, California.
Despite plenty of pre-event chatter that the device would be available in time for the holiday season, the Apple Watch will not be out until early next year, priced from $349.
5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, which he touted as the biggest advancements in iPhone history.
They are thinner than previous versions of the iPhone, and the devices feature Retina HD displays and an enhanced A8 processor which is 50 percent more efficient than the A7 processor found on the iPhone 5s and 5c.
The phones also mark the debut of Apple Pay, a contactless mobile payment technology.
Companies working with Apple on Apple Pay include Mastercard, Visa and American Express and retailers such as Target and Whole Foods.
Tech analysts had hoped that Apple would launch the watch in time for the lucrative holiday season, particularly at a time when rival Samsung is ramping up its efforts in the smartwatch space.
Sept.
Consumers, however, should not see the Apple Watch as a replacement for their existing devices.
During his speech, Cook made it clear that the Apple Watch is not a standalone device, explaining that the watch is designed to work with the iPhone.
Three versions of the watch were launched at the event – Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, a high-end version of the technology built using 18-karat rose or yellow gold.
The watch will also be available in two sizes – 38 mm and 42 mm.
Smartwatch technologies have hardly set the world alight, so consumers were keen to see how Apple plans to set itself apart from rivals.
The Apple Watch certainly boasts some interesting features, such as its ‘Digital Crown’ – a small dial on the side of the device that is used to navigate through the watch’s screens.
During his speech, Cook explained that the device’s small screen made it impractical to transfer the iPhone interface to Apple Watch.
Other features of Apple Watch include a “taptic engine,” which subtly vibrates to let users know when they have received a message or a notification from a source such as Facebook.
Apple has also built sensors into the back of the Apple Watch to monitor vital signs such as heart rate and support the company’s drive into health and fitness technology.
Apple appears to be pushing variety as a core element of its smartwatch strategy, touting a host of different straps that can be used with the device, from a ‘Sport Band’ built from Elastomer to a leather quilted leather loop to a stainless steel bracelet.
Pund-IT, said he was surprised that Apple will not launch its smartwatch until 2015.
The device only works with iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, 6 or 6 Plus running iOS8, the latest version of Apple s operating system.
Both of the new phones come in gold, silver and space gray.
Pricing for the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for a 16GB version, $299 for a 64GB model and a 128GB version for $399.
The iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for a 16GB model, $399 for a 64GB version and $499 for a 128GB model of the phone.

Microsoft s approach with Windows, and backward compatibility in general , is commendable.
Users can install new versions of this OS on old machines, sometimes built on a mishmash of components, and still have it work well.
This is a remarkable feat of engineering.
But Apple doesn t share this focus on interoperability or legacy.
They restrict hardware options, so they can build around a smaller number of specs.
Old hardware is often left behind  turn on a first-generation iPad, and witness the sluggishness .
Meanwhile, dying conventions are proactively euthanized,  says Karjaluoto.   When Macs no longer shipped with floppy drives, many felt baffled.
In spite of the grumblings of many, Karjaluoto doesn t recall many such changes that we didn t later look upon as the right choice.
10 Yosemite, Ars Technica has posted one of their extremely thorough reviews of the OS s new features and design changes .
John Siracusa writes that Yosemite is particularly notable because it s the biggest step yet in Apple s efforts to bring OS X and iOS together — new technologies are now being added to Apple s two operating systems simultaneously.
The political and technical battles inherent in the former two-track development strategy for OS X and iOS left both products with uncomfortable feature disparities.
Yosemite s look and feel has undergone significant changes as well, generally moving toward the flat and compact design present in iOS 7 & 8.
Spotlight and the Notifications Center have gotten some needed improvements, as did many tab and toolbar interfaces.
Swift is an attempt to create a low-level language with high-level syntax and semantics.
Viewed in isolation, Yosemite provides a graphical refresh accompanied by a few interesting features and several new technologies whose benefits are mostly speculative, depending heavily on how eagerly they re adopted by third-party developers.
But Apple no longer views the Mac in isolation, and neither should you.
Apple pay will launch Monday.
WatchKit -- a way for developers to make apps for the Apple Watch will launch next month.
Messages, iTunes, and iWork updated and many more new features in OS X Yosemite.
You can send and receive calls on your Mac if you have an iPhone with iOS 8 that s signed into the same FaceTime account.

Dave Knott writes: While freezing eggs has become an increasingly popular practice for career-oriented women, the procedure comes at a steep price: Costs typically add up to at least $10,000 for every round, plus $500 or more annually for storage.
Now two Silicon Valley giants are offering women a game-changing perk: Apple and Facebook will pay for employees to freeze their eggs .
They appear to be the first major employers to offer this coverage for non-medical reasons, both offering to cover costs up to $20,000.
Tech firms are hardly alone in offering generous benefits to attract and keep talent, but they appear to be leading the way with egg freezing.
Advocates say they ve heard murmurs of large law, consulting, and finance firms helping to cover the costs, although no one is broadcasting this support.
Companies may be concerned about the public relations implications of the benefit – in the most cynical light, egg-freezing coverage could be viewed as a ploy to entice women to sell their souls to their employer, sacrificing childbearing years for the promise of promotion.
Will the perk pay off for companies?
The benefit will likely encourage women to stay with their employer longer, cutting down on recruiting and hiring costs.
And practically speaking, when women freeze their eggs early, firms may save on pregnancy costs in the long run.
A woman could avoid paying to use a donor egg down the road, for example, or undergoing more intensive fertility treatments when she s ready to have a baby.
But the emotional and cultural payoff may be more valuable, helping women be more productive human beings.

Now that Apple has officially swallowed Beats, Ian Rogers, the head of Beats’ subscription-music service, will also oversee the iPhone-maker’s iTunes Radio efforts, according to people familiar with the matter.
Apple said Friday that it had closed the $3 billion acquisition of the headphone manufacturer and subscription-music provider.
As part of the deal, Beats’ executive team, including Rogers and co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr.
Dre, have joined Apple.
On its website, Apple posted a short message welcoming the Beats team.
Music has always held a special place in our hearts, and we’re thrilled to join forces with a group of people who love it as much as we do,” Apple wrote .
By acquiring Beats Music, a $10-a-month streaming service, Apple puts another music option alongside iTunes Radio, a free ad-supported offering.
Apple launched iTunes Radio in September 2013.

Australia.
Rogers, a former Yahoo executive, will run both teams to create cohesion in Apple’s streaming-music options, according to the people familiar with the matter.
Pandora and Spotify, the two-biggest streaming music services, each offer both a free ad-supported service and a subscription-based service.
As part of the acquisition, Apple is cutting 200 of the more than 700 jobs at Beats Electronics, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The person said the affected positions will come from areas such as human resources, finance and support services, where there will be considerable overlap after Beats is part of Apple.
