This article is about the Kleenex brand.
For the band, see Kleenex  band  .
For the generic item, see Facial tissue .
Kleenex is a brand name for a variety of paper-based products such as facial tissue , bathroom tissue , paper towels , Tampons , and diapers .
Often used as a genericized trademark , especially in the United States, the name Kleenex is a registered trademark of Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.
Kleenex products are manufactured in 30 countries and sold in more than 170 countries.
Such Kleenex brands include VIVA, Cottonelle and Huggies .
Kleenex was the first Western facial tissue, introduced in 1924 and originally marketed as a way to remove cold cream or makeup  it had been in use for centuries before in Japan; see History of facial tissue for details .
1] It was a disposable substitute for face towels.
In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing  the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars... .
A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the company s head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever .
The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief.
By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan “Don’t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket” and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant.
2] In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.
The original Kleenex trademark application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  was filed in the class of Medical, Beauty, & Agricultural Services by Cellucotton Products Company of Neenah, Wisconsin on Saturday, July 12, 1924.
First use for the drawing and stylized word mark was on June 12, 1924 and first use in commerce on June 12, 1924 as well.
USPTO granted trademark registration on November 25, 1924.
International Cellucotton Products Company officially assigned trademark interest and good will of the business to Kimberly-Clark Corporation on September 30, 1955.
Kimberly-Clark Corporation of Neenah , Wisconsin is the current registered owner of the Kleenex trademark.
In the USA, the Kleenex name has become, or as a legal matter nearly has become, genericized : the popularity of the product has led to the use of its name to refer to any facial tissue, regardless of the brand.
Many dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster and Oxford, now include definitions in their publications defining it as such.

I want to start this off by thanking Kleenex for selling these in 36-packs.
I ve put it on subscription, and if they want to start selling a 72-pack, sign me up.
I have three reasons for needing this much Kleenex, and their names are Liam, Samuel and Hank.
This is how it goes in this house.
First the Kleenex disappears.
Then the toilet paper.
Then they go for fabrics.
And you don t want it to get there, unless you re ready to invest in a five gallon drum of Fabreeze.
This used to be a good Christian home.
But it s not about moral judgment anymore.
I m way beyond that.
I m in survival mode.
If I don t supply absorbent paper products, I m going to find my dish towels hidden in the basement, stiff as aluminum.
The other day, I almost cut my hand on a sock.
I am sorry to speak so frankly, but with three teenage boys, a woman has got to be practical.
The funny part is, they think they re being sneaky, with their 45 minute showers and sudden need for  privacy , as if I m going to walk in on them journaling.
They slink around the house like unfixed cats, while I try to announce my location at all times.
No one needs to ask me to knock anymore.
I knock on the walls.
I practically wear a cow bell.
I m not looking to catch anyone by surprise, believe me.
I m just trying to get through this.
I about knocked him off his chair.

I had the subscription for the 100 tissues per box and a case of 36 boxes for around $35.
This is a box of 85 tissues per box and 36 boxes in the case for $47.
Not an improvement, more money fewer tissues.
Cancelling my subscription.
The tissues are nice, unscented but the cost has made these higher priced that purchasing in the store.

The product is good but too pricey for the amount of tissues you get.
A tissue count of 100 used to be offered on subscribe and save for less money but now the option is for an 85 count tissue box for more money.
I only stopped buying these because of the price.

I have been purchasing the 36 count carton of 100-ct  per individual box  of Kleenex tissues from the Subscribe & Save program at amazon for a couple of years now.
008 to be exact .
012 to be exact  which might not seem like a lot, but 1  Amazon did not notify the S&S customers of a PRICE increase, they just said the QUANTITY is changing.
33% increase per tissue!
Nothing to sneeze at and this may send me back to my local store if Amazon doesn t come up with a better price.
While I understand that the manufacturer has the right to change quantities of a product, Amazon should be making sure that people realize they are now paying more than previously for less product.
Buyers beware!

This was a great deal especially since I have several kids starting school and all of them have to bring 2-3 boxes of tissues each.
So this takes care of school and home with a few extra boxes to have on hand.
These are just the basic tissues, nothing fancy, no lotions, aloe, etc.

I couldn t find any at the store and bought a competitor brand; the first thing I noticed was that my allergies weren t as bad as they usually were!
When I went back to the store again, and bought the Kleenex, my allergies were back!
I hadn t noticed it before, but Kleenex tissues are kind of flaky, and I think the little particles that fly around actually aggrivate my allergy symptoms, causing me to use more and more tissues!

I am so delighted that there is a gift wrap option for this.
I expect that Amazon would use some pretty printed gift wrap appropriate for the season.
Using tissue as gift wrap just wouldn t make sense.
I mean, what s the point in wrapping tissue with wrapping tissue?

To protect their products  names, the makers of Botox, Xerox, and Tabasco are advertising directly to the people who write articles about them.
Trademarks are tricky—almost paradoxical—things: The more popular your product gets, the greater the chance you lose control of its identity.
Trademark law recognizes a spectrum of  distinctiveness  when it comes to products  names , ranging from  arbitrary or fanciful   think Starbucks, Polaroid, and Apple-as-applied-to-computers  to  suggestive   Whirlpool  to  descriptive   Saltine crackers  to  generic.  And once the Patent and Trademark Office determines that the name of your product—no matter how arbitrary  fanciful suggestive it was at first—has become generic, you lose your trademark.
You get, basically, cellophaned.
Call it tradesplaining.
Or just, you know,  TM I.
To counteract that, companies employ a slew of different strategies—some subtle, some very much less so—to associate their products with their brands in the minds of the public.
And to prove, should they face a trademark challenge from a competitor, that they are actively protecting those brand identities.
One of those strategies—a long-standing one—is advertising directly to the people who write about their products in the media.
Companies place messages in trade publications targeted to journalists reminding them to include the ® when they re writing about products like Kleenex  sorry, Kleenex® , Botox  BOTOX® , and Tabasco  TABASCO® .
They also place similar ads in legal trade pubs.
Which is a more passive-aggressive, but possibly more effective, move—since a quick search through the archives of some of the biggest news outlets reveals references to those products that are noticeably ®-less.
Call it tradesplaining.
Or just, you know,  TM I.

When it comes to fashion, facial tissue is nothing to sneeze at anymore.
Kleenex has enlisted designer Isaac Mizrahi for a new marketing campaign and collection of tissue boxes, as the brand already known for novel oval and fruit-inspired wedge boxes looks to take its design to the next level.
A design-focused campaign kicks off with a TV ad from JWT , New York, breaking Jan.
6 showing Kleenex boxes as part of colorful home designs as the Kimberly-Clark Corp.
Mr.
Mizrahi will contribute to the style-focused Style Studio microsite for Kleenex, which is wrapped up with the celebration of the brand s 90th anniversary.
The site, among other things, points out that Kleenex boxes have twice been featured in New York s Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Kleenex led the movement away from handkerchiefs with what was originally a beauty product designed for makeup removal rather than sneeze catching.
But we ve also led in design,  said Brand Manager Anna Elledge.  We have an extensive process we go through to research and forecast out design trends looking out for the next four years.
Ms.
Elledge said.
Mr.
Mizrahi was a good match given  his focus on design is about making it accessible to all consumers,  she said, evidenced by his extensive partnership with Target across home and apparel categories.
Mr.
Mizrahi s box designs are based on fashion trends that will also be seen in his spring home and clothing collection.
They re  thought-provoking,  Ms.
Elledge said, but won t be available at retail until April after being revealed during a March 17 event in New York, where  Catwalk or Kleenex  sweepstakes winners will get to meet Mr.
Mizrahi.
Entrants will be shown a series of paired photos and be asked to guess which is a design of a dress and which is the design for a Kleenex box, then entered into a drawing for a chance to win $5,000 and the trip.
The stepped-up design focus comes as Kleenex faces a cold and flu season that s been slower to materialize than last year s unusually heavy one during a time when the category leader faces increasingly price focused competition.
6 billion facial-tissue category for the year ended Dec.
1, according to IRI.
But Kleenex still lost a tenth of a share point as private label and a new value entry from Georgia-Pacific s Angel Soft gained ground.
Though colds and flu are down from last year, Ms.
Elledge said, but sniffles are on the upswing nationally in recent weeks, and brand advertising encourages people to buy in advance to be prepared.
Besides JWT, WPP siblings Mindshare , Geometry and VML are handling media, shopper marketing and digital creative respectively.
Omnicom s Ketchum is handling PR.

Kleenex® Boutique Facial Tissues are an essential part of any workplace.
Strong and gentle on the nose, these tissues come in several different styles of boxes that will fit in well wherever they go, whether in the breakroom, the reception area or the cubicle.
The continuous dispenser is easy to use, with tissues that change from white to beige to indicate that it’s almost time for a new box.
Kleenex® Boutique facial tissues are made from 20% post-consumer recycled fiber and yet are still soft to the touch, meaning they’re as good for the earth as they are for you.
Kleenex Boutique facial tissues feature two-ply construction from luxuriously soft fibers.
They re durable enough to hold up to small messes and spills but soft and comfortable enough to use on the most delicate parts of your face.
Kleenex Boutique facial tissues are unscented and free of dyes, making them an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin.
These tissues won t cause irritation or allergic reactions.
They re free of lotions too, so they won t cause inadvertent blemishes or leave greasy residue behind.
Each box of tissues in the Kleenex Boutique line features a neutral but appealing design in muted tones that blend in nicely with any décor.
The convenient pop-up dispenser means you won t have to reach inside to grab the next tissue, and when the box is nearly empty, the tissues turn tan to let you know it s time for a replacement.
I like that when the tissues are low they change from white to a beige color.
That lets you know that you need another box.

I have a decorative tissue toilet paper holder in my bathroom and this tissue box fits it perfectly!
This item was on sale at a great price and the shipping was very fast.
Very happy with product!
Would you recommend this product?
It s a great product of course!
Not only do they make a great snot catcher, but also make a great substitute for toilet paper when in a pinch!
Fair warning to all that each tissue should be doubleed, trippled, if not quadrupled when using in place of toilet paper.
The box is luckily the most drab part of this product.
But the 1990 s faded flower arrangement on the side gives you that added savings!
As an additional bonus, these boxes also double as a spooky halloween decoration that s sure to scare the entire town!

The facial tissue brand is promoting a new flu prediction tool that tells you when you re going to get sick  so you can conveniently stock up on Kleenex beforehand .
The cold season is stealthily creeping in, and Kleenex wants to be on your mind even before you start feeling feverish.
The facial tissue brand has created a digital tool called Achoo to predict when you ll start getting the flu this year, AdAge reports.
Centers for Disease Control to predict which areas will be germ-ridden three weeks before outbreaks start.
This prediction strategy is different from existing flu tracker tools like Google Flu Trends , which focuses on mapping outbreak trends in near real time.
Kleenex brand manager Anna Elledge says the prediction tool has been 90% accurate in preliminary tests.
At the end of the month, Achoo will predict the top five to 10 cities expected to get hit by flu season the hardest.
Visitors will also be able to enter their zip code to get up to speed on regional cold and flu forecasts.
Kleenex  bzw.
1980 LiLiPUT  war die einzige Schweizer Post-Punk-Band , die auch international bekannt wurde und bis heute bei einer kleinen Fangemeinde als Kultband gilt.
Lislot Ha.
Klaudia Schiff lernten sich Anfang 1977 in Zürich kennen und bildeten im Juli 1977 ein Künstlerduo namens Superchunks, das einige Kurzfilme drehte.
1]  Inspiriert von der auch in Zürich aufkommenden Punkbewegung beschlossen die beiden, sich auf Musik umzuorientieren und eine Band zu gründen.
Am 8.
Januar 1978  gründeten Ha.
Schiff zusammen mit der Sängerin Regula Sing die Band Kleenex und begannen in einem Bunker in Zürich ihre Instrumente zu erlernen.
Zwei Mitglieder der befreundeten Punkband Nasal Boys, Rudolph Dietrich und Gogi Düggelbach, halfen bei den anfänglichen Proben an der Gitarre aus.
Bei einem Konzert der Nasal Boys  lernten sie einige Wochen später die Saxophonistin Marlene Marder kennen und luden sie ein, bei ihnen mitzuspielen.
Das erste Konzert von Kleenex fand am 29.
30 Uhr im Club Hey in Zürich als Vorgruppe der Nasal Boys statt.
Die Band hatte nur vier selbstgeschriebene Songs, die mit Hilfe von Dietrich und Düggelbach dem begeisterten Publikum präsentiert wurden.
Als Zugabe spielte die Band die Songs erneut, nun aber mit Marlene Marder an der Gitarre, die somit zum festen Bandmitglied wurde.
Ende April 1978 fanden zwei weitere Konzerte statt, bei denen Gogi Düggelbach noch als zweiter Gitarrist aushalf, davon eines als Vorgruppe der britischen Band XTC .
Am 3.
Mai 1978  spielten Kleenex zum ersten Mal in Viererbesetzung als reine Frauenband, was von nun an ihr Image in den Medien bestimmte.
Im September 1978 gingen Kleenex für zwei Tage ins Sunrise-Studio in Kirchberg , um eine Single mit vier Songs aufzunehmen, die Anfang November 1978 auf dem Schweizer Label Sunrise Records erschien.
Sowohl das Singlecover als auch die Promotionphotos brachten die Band zum ersten Mal in Zusammenhang mit Kunstrichtungen wie Dadaismus , Expressionismus und Futurismus ,  eine Verbindung, die 1981 von dem amerikanischen Musikjournalisten Greil Marcus , einem Fan der Band, aufgegriffen und später in mehreren seiner Bücher erwähnt wurde.
Die Band schickte die Single auch an britische Musikzeitschriften, mit dem Erfolg, dass Sounds sie zur  Single der Woche  machte.
Im November 1978 traten Kleenex zum ersten Mal mit einigen ihrer Songs im Schweizer Fernsehen auf.
Die Vorabendsendung Karussell erlaubte ihnen jedoch nur zum Vollplayback zu mimen, sehr zum Ärger der Band  Klaudia Schiff:  Wir haben mal versucht, in einer Fernsehsendung in der Schweiz zu spielen. Es ist echt Scheisse, denn man kann nicht live spielen.    Der TV-Auftritt hatte zur Folge, dass die Sängerin Regula ihre Arbeit als Verkäuferin in einem Zürcher Fotogeschäft verlor.
11] Ein weiterer Playbackauftritt fand am 14.
Dezember 1978 im deutschen Fernsehen statt.
12] Die Clips wurden 2010 vom amerikanischen Label Kill Rock Stars offiziell auf DVD veröffentlicht.
Rough Trade brachten am 12.
000mal verkaufte.
13] Mitte März 1979 fuhr die Band für sechs Tage nach London, um in den Kingsway Studios ihre zweite Single  Ü  aufzunehmen, die am 10.
Mai 1979 von Rough Trade veröffentlicht wurde.
An diesem Tag begann auch eine Grossbritannientour zusammen mit den Raincoats und Spizzenergi , die bis zum 5.
Juni 1979 dauerte.
Die UK-Tour bedeutete das Ende von Kleenex, da man sich danach in gegenseitigem Einvernehmen von der Sängerin Regula Sing trennte, mit der es schon seit längerem Differenzen gab.
Dazu kam, dass die Band an der Tour nichts verdient hatte, sondern im Gegenteil auf erheblichen Unkosten sitzengeblieben war.
Der bisherige Manager hatte ausserdem mehrere Raten für das Equipments nicht gezahlt, so dass Verstärker und Instrumente zurückgegeben werden mussten.
Die drei übriggebliebenen Musikerinnen beschlossen das alte Songmaterial ad acta zu legen und mit einer neuen Sängerin weiterzumachen.
Regula Sing hingegen tauchte 1980 als Mitglied der  Luzerner Mädchenband Retro   wieder auf.
Am 5.
November 1979 erreichte Klaudia Schiff dann ein Anwaltsschreiben, in dem der Band auch die künftige Verwendung des geschützten Markennamens Kleenex untersagt wurde.
Somit musste ein neuer Bandname gefunden werden.
Marder, Schiff und Ha.
Herbst 1979 eine neue Sängerin zu suchen.
Im Oktober bewarb sich die 16-jährige Chrigle Freund aus Bern , die vorher kurzzeitig bei der Berner Punkband Chaos gesungen hatte, erfolgreich um den Job.
Sie fuhr zunächst drei Mal pro Woche zum Proben nach Zürich und zog schliesslich in Klaudia Schiffs Haus ein.
Im Dezember 1979 stiess dann zusätzlich die Saxofonspielerin Angela Barrack zur Band.
Am 15.
Dezember 1979 gab die neue Besetzung dem Drop Dead-Fanzine ein Interview, in dem Liveauftritte für frühestens März angekündigt wurden.
Das Interview fand immer noch unter dem Namen Kleenex statt, da ein neuer Name noch nicht gefunden war.
Das erste Konzert der neuen Band fand am 2.
April 1980 in Genf unter dem provisorischen Namen Wigwam statt.
17] Beim nächsten Konzert am 26.
April 1980 benutzte man dann erstmals den neuen Namen LiLiPUT, den Lislot Ha.
18] Ein Konzert am 28.
Mai in Biel wurde vom Schweizer Radio übertragen und 1993 auf der Complete Recordings-CD veröffentlicht.
19] Im Juni folgte eine Deutschlandtour.
Anfang Juli 1980 erschien dann auf dem englischen Rough Trade-Label die erste LiLiPUT-Single  Split Die Matrosen , die wieder im Sunrise-Studio in Kirchberg aufgenommen worden war und einen deutlich chaotischeren Sound bot als die alten Kleenex.
Nicht zuletzt wegen der sehr eingängigen, teilweise gepfiffenen B-Seite erreichte die Single in England Platz 17 der Alternativen Charts im Sounds-Magazin .
Am 26.
September 1980 erschien auf dem Zürcher Off Course-Label die Compilation   Swiss Wave - The Album  , auf der LiLiPUT mit zwei Songs vertreten waren.
Nachdem die ebenfalls darauf vertretene Band Grauzone 1981 mit ihrer Single  Eisbär  in Deutschland und Österreich in die Charts gekommen waren, verkaufte sich die Platte insgesamt eine halbe Million mal.
Eine einwöchige Englandtour Anfang Oktober 1980 endete abermals im Streit: diesmal verliess die Bandgründerin Lislot Ha.
Gruppe.
Angela Barrack stieg ebenfalls wieder aus, beide verliessen die Musikbranche.
Eine für den November gebuchte Deutschlandtour wurde abgesagt.
In Dreierbesetzung  Chrigle Freund spielte Schlagzeug  nahmen LiLiPUT im Sunrise-Studio in Kirchberg eine zweite Single  Eisiger Wind When the cat s away then the mice will play  auf, die im Februar 1981 in der Schweiz auf dem Off Course- und in England auf dem Rough Trade-Label erschien.
Auf dem Cover der Single posierten LiLiPUT in Kostümen, die eine Reminiszenz an den Dadaisten Hugo Ball darstellten.
Dies und der deutlich dadaistische Text der vorangegangenen Single  Split  erregte die Aufmerksamkeit des US-amerikanischen Musikjournalisten Greil Marcus , der darüber im kalifornischen  New West -Magazin einen Essay veröffentlichte  und die Band somit auch einer kleinen Fangemeinde in den USA bekanntmachte.
Der Essay erschien im Januar 1982 auch in deutscher Übersetzung in der  Rock Session -Taschenbuchreihe im Rowohlt Verlag .
Zum Zeitpunkt der Veröffentlichung der Single war die Sängerin Chrigel Freund jedoch bereits ausgestiegen und hatte Marder und Schiff als Duo zurückgelassen.
Klaudia Schiff sprach in einem Interview von einem  riesigen Berg Schulden , auf dem die Band mittlerweile sitze.
Ende Januar 1981 fanden LiLiPUT mit der 26-jährigen Büroangestellten Astrid Spirig  vorher bei der Zürcher Band Neon  eine neue Sängerin.
Aus Probesessions mit dem 19-jährigen Schlagzeuger Beat Schlatter und dem 22-jährigen Saxofonspieler Christoph Herzog entstand ein neues Line-Up, wobei die Aufnahme von zwei Männern in die Band jedoch zu Irritationen in der Musikpresse führte.
Ihr Livedebüt gab die neue Band bei den Münchner Rocktagen im April 1981, es folgte ein Auftritt beim feministischen Rockfestival im Berliner Tempodrom am 20.
Juni 1981.
Ein Livesong dieses Auftrittes  Waxing Moon  wurde auf dem Compilationalbum Venus Weltklang veröffentlicht.
Die Band nahm 1981 drei Songs  I had a dream Turn the table Dolly Dollar  für eine Single auf, die dann aber nicht veröffentlicht wurde.
Die Songs erschienen schliesslich 1993 auf der Complete Recordings-CD.
Im Februar 1982 gingen LiLiPUT ins Studio Platinum in Oberehrendingen , um mit dem Toningenieur Harry Zindel ihr erstes Studioalbum Liliput aufzunehmen, das am 11.
August auf dem englischen Rough Trade-Label erschien.
Marlene Marder bemerkte auf die Frage, warum die Band bis dahin noch kein komplettes Album aufgenommen hatte:  Die ersten Singles hatten wir selbst finanziert, jeder von uns hat was beigesteuert. Ein Album ist viel teurer. Rough Trade fragten uns und bezahlten auch, also machten wir es.  Wir haben die Gelegenheit wahrgenommen. Und wir hatten gerade Zeit.   Die Musik hatte sich von der kantigen New Wave-Rhythmik der frühen Kleenex über den chaotischen Sound der 1980er LiLiPUT-Besetzung nunmehr weiterentwickelt zu leicht jazzig-improvisatorischem New Wave mit verspielten Weltmusik -Anklängen.
Passend zur LP-Veröffentlichung am 11.
August folgte im September 1982 eine ausgedehnte Deutschlandtour.
Die Band, die von Stephan Eicher als Gastmusiker begleitet wurde, nahm eine Super 8 -Kamera mit und fertigte einige Aufnahmen ohne Ton an, die 2010 auf der Live Recordings, TV-Clips & Roadmovie-DVD veröffentlicht wurden.
Nach der Tour wollten Marder und Schifferle  die ab Juni 1982 auf der documenta in Kassel ausgestellt hatte  die Band eigentlich auflösen, Astrid Spirig überredete die beiden jedoch dazu weiterzumachen und übernahm das Management der Band.
Am 11.
März 1983 spielte die Band ein Konzert in der Roten Fabrik in Zürich, das vom Schweizer Radio aufgezeichnet und 2010 auf der Live Recordings, TV-Clips & Roadmovie-DVD veröffentlicht wurde.
Ebenfalls im März 1983 erschien die neue Single The Jatz You did it als erste Veröffentlichung des neugegründeten Rough Trade Deutschland -Labels, mit dem Spirig auch die Finanzierung eines zweiten Studioalbums aushandelte, das im Juni 1983 im Studio Platinum in Oberehrendingen mit diversen Gastmusikern aufgenommen wurde.
Für den Albumtrack Boat-Song wurde auch ein Video gedreht, das 2010 auf der Live Recordings, TV-Clips & Roadmovie-DVD erschien.
Das letzte LiLiPUT-Konzert fand im Oktober 1983 im Zürcher Mascotte Club statt.
Musicalschule in New York besuchen, weil wir in unseren Bühnenauftritten vermehrt visuelle Elemente einbauen wollten.
Die Vorstellung, die Rough Trade Deutschland vom zweiten Album hatten, war, dass wir damit auf Tour gegen sollten.
Aber dann wurde Astrid schwanger, und das war das Ende der Band.
Das klassische Ende.
Sie kam zu uns und sagte  Ich bin schwanger.
Sorry, Mädels.
Enttäuscht war ich eigentlich nicht.
Marlene Marder war nach 1984 die einzige, die weiter in der Musikbranche tätig war.
Sie veröffentlichte ihre Erinnerungen Ende 1986 in dem Buch  Kleenex LiLiPUT - Das Tagebuch der Gitarristin Marlene Marder , das immer noch erhältlich ist.
1993 stellte sie die Compilation Complete Recordings zusammen, die auf dem Schweizer Off Course-Label erschien und 2001 von Kill Rock Stars in den USA wiederveröffentlicht wurde.
2010 folgte mit Live Recordings, TV-Clips & Roadmovie eine Live-Compilation-CD, der eine DVD mit Videoclips beilag.
Klaudia Schifferle ist heute eine bekannte bildende Künstlerin, Beat Schlatter ein erfolgreicher TV- und Filmkomiker in der Deutschschweiz .

Hi!
I m a young mom to three adorable kiddos, two boys and a girl, and have one amazing husband.
We are a typical American family, struggling with finances, budgeting, and the challenges that come with raising children in today s fast-moving world.
This is absolutely, amazingly perfect.
Kleenex “facial” tissue, my ass!
Are you following Pajiba on Facebook or Twitter ?
Every time you do, Bill Murray crashes a wedding.
But, see, gay men living alone are so much more practical in matters such as these.
EXTRA  PURPOSE SPECIFIC  TOWELS.
But somehow people have to get over the bashfulness and admit what s going on, at least within themselves.
And surely there s no mom alive that doesn t have dish towels that have been well used since they were received as wedding gifts.
PRACTICAL MATTERS.
I like the other one passed around a few years ago, about the college that needed to send out a memo cause all the dudes were jizzing in the coed showers so much it clogged up the drains something fierce.
Sounds as though some guys need to either jerk off more frequently  preferably not in the shower, I get it  or head to the urologist to see what the hell s going on in their prostates.
Well combination of a lot of guys jizzing into a drain, then also tossing in their tissues or what have you along with it.
Now that s just gross.
YOU RE IN THE FRICKIN  SHOWER.
YOU DON T NEED TO USE TISSUES.
I wish there was an emoticon for gagging back vomit.
If a repost from Reddit that Dustin didn t even bother to check on Amazon gets more comments than the American Hustle review then I m going back to AICN for the first time in 8 years.
But the picture of this post is taken from Stargate!
I promise I ll comment about American Hustle once I ve seen it.
Your quiet dignity and uncompromising standards are an inspiration to all.
But is he one we need right now?
Because it seems like we might want a strong detergent and difficult button flys first.
Wasn t there a similar albeit shorter rant in the movie Bridesmaids?
Yep, Wendi McLendon-Covey s character in Bridesmaids.
I don t care about the authenticity of that review because I m laughing too hard!
Hilarious.
It s a fake, written by a wit who regularly puts  reviews  like this up on Amazon.
Don t get me wrong; it s hilarious and totally worth sharing.
But it s not a real mom w  three real teenage compulsive masturbators.
Heh.
John G.
I want to start this off by thanking Kleenex for selling these in 36-packs.
I ve put it on subscription, and if they want to start selling a 72-pack, sign me up.
I have three reasons for needing this much Kleenex, and their names are Liam, Samuel and Hank.
This is how it goes in this house.
First the Kleenex disappears.
Then the toilet paper.
Then they go for fabrics.
And you don t want it to get there, unless you re ready to invest in a five gallon drum of Fabreeze.
This used to be a good Christian home.
But it s not about moral judgment anymore.
I m way beyond that.
I m in survival mode.
If I don t supply absorbent paper products, I m going to find my dish towels hidden in the basement, stiff as aluminum.
The other day, I almost cut my hand on a sock.
I am sorry to speak so frankly, but with three teenage boys, a woman has got to be practical.
The funny part is, they think they re being sneaky, with their 45 minute showers and sudden need for  privacy , as if I m going to walk in on them journaling.
They slink around the house like unfixed cats, while I try to announce my location at all times.
No one needs to ask me to knock anymore.
I knock on the walls.
I practically wear a cow bell.
I m not looking to catch anyone by surprise, believe me.
I m just trying to get through this.
I about knocked him off his chair.
Before you start feeling too sorry for this long-suffering mom, it turns out the author is actually James O.
Thach, a smart-ass who gets his kicks writing satirical Amazon reviews.
So there s way more where that Kleenex review came from.
As a traffic court judge, I cannot say enough good things about this Mankini.
It lets me luxuriate in my silky vestments while still upholding the dignity of court.
It s snug, but never confining.
And after listening to seven hours of testimony about illegal u-turns, that slim thong back is the only thing between me and insanity.
I know I ll never look at Law and Order reruns the same way again.
There s enough on his author page to burn a good two hours.
And let s face it, it s not like you were going to get anything else done today.

In 1924, the Kleenex brand of facial tissue was first introduced.
Kleenex tissue was invented as a means to remove cold cream.
Early advertisements linked Kleenex to Hollywood makeup departments and sometimes included endorsements from movie stars   Helen Hayes and Jean Harlow   who used Kleenex to remove their theatrical make-up with cold cream.
A test was conducted in the Peoria, Illinois newspaper.
Ads were run depicting the two main uses of Kleenex; either as a means to remove cold cream or as disposable handkerchief for blowing noses.
The readers were asked to respond.
Results showed that 60% used Kleenex tissue for blowing their nose.
By 1930, Kimberly-Clark had changed the way they advertised Kleenex and sales doubled proving that the customer is always right.
In 1928, the familiar pop-up tissue cartons with a perforated opening was introduced.
In 1929, colored Kleenex tissue was introduced and a year later printed tissues.
That same year, the Kleenex company came up with the phrase,  The handkerchief you can throw away!  to use in their advertisements.
During World War Two, rations were placed on the production of paper products and the manufacturing of Kleenex tissues was limited.
However, the technology used in the tissues was applied to the field bandages and dressings used during the war effort giving the company a big boost in publicity.
Supplies of paper products returned to normal in 1945 after the war ended.
In 1941, Kleenex MANSIZE tissues were launched, as indicated by the name this product was aimed at the male consumer.
In 1949, a tissue for eyeglasses was released.
During the 50s , spread of the popularity of the tissues continued to grow.
In 1954, the tissue was the official sponsor on the popular television show, The Perry Como Hour .
During the 60s , the company began successfully advertising the tissue during daytime programming rather than just nighttime television.
SPACESAVER tissue packs were introduced, as well as purse packs and juniors.
In 1967, the new square upright tissue box  BOUTIQUE  was introduced.
In 1981, the first scented tissue was introduced to the market  SOFTIQUE .
In 1986, Kleenex atarted the  bless You  advertising campaign.
In 1998, the company first used a six color printing process on their tissues allowing for complex prints on their tissues.
By the 00s , Kleenex is selling tissues in over 150 different countries.
Where Did The Word Come From?
In 1924, when Kleenex tissues were first introduced to the public they were intended to be used with cold cream to remove make up and  clean  the face.
The Kleen in Kleenex represented that  clean .
The ex at the end of the word was tied into the company s other popular and successful product at the time, Kotex brand feminine napkins.
The word Kleenex is now commonly used to describe any soft facial tissue  see third photo .
However, Kleenex is the trademarked name of the soft facial tissue manufactured and sold by the Kimberly-Clark Corporation.

The Kleenex trademark is owned by Kimberly-Clark, which launched the brand in 1924 as a disposable cleaning tissue for removing cosmetics.
The brand launched as a handkerchief substitute in 1930 and has been the No.
1 selling facial tissue in the world ever since.
Today it is sold in more than 170 countries.
History is littered with millionaire thieves who managed to capitalize on an existing idea in a way that effectively made it their own.
This should be good news for most of us, since it relieves us of the pressure to truly invent and innovate.

J.
Williamson was asked to buy five boxes of facial tissues for her son s class in exchange for 100 points extra credit.
Is the tradeoff worth it?
J.
Williamson  s son, a student in the Los Angeles Unified School District, came home with an unusual homework assignment from his history class: Bring in five boxes of facial tissues.
This assignment would be worth 100 points in extra credit.
The soft kind, not the cheap kind, ” his teacher said.
A hundred points is equivalent to a full week’s worth of homework.
So I wondered: if five boxes of tissues meant 100 points, would 100 boxes of tissues buy us out of homework for a full semester?
Imagine the family time we could have!
But I knew my son would complain about stuffing a hundred boxes of Kleenex into his backpack, so I started thinking about alternatives.
Then I did the math.
Of course, that assumes every single parent has the time and money to go out and buy the five boxes of tissues.
But what about the ones who can’t?
When I thought about their plight, I got angry.
I wrote the school counselor.
The tissue was for extra credit, not for a grade,” she explained.
NEVER tie an assignment of bringing in tissue to a grade.
Yes, any extra credit WILL help a student s grade.
Why can t they order tissues?
So a software “upgrade” left a number of campuses unable to order supplies … like tissues.
In the middle of cold and flu season.
So teachers began bribing students’ families into buying supplies themselves.
I wrote one last email, explaining that I harbored serious philosophical objections to letting donations impact student grades.
It was immoral.
It was unethical.
And any history teacher should know that trading Kleenex for grades is no better than trading arms for hostages.
Then I went to the store and bought five boxes of tissues.
In the end, 100 points is nothing to sneeze at.

Customer has been confirmed to have purchased the item from Walmart.
I have a definite need for tissues as my sinuses are either stuffed or runny daily.
The Kleenex tissues are a good quality tissue and if you do the math this tissue deal is the best tissue for the price.
I would like to see the price lower because I use quite a few every day, but I have looked in stores and online and the rollback price on these tissues makes it the best deal I have seen.
Plus Kleenex tissues are dependable quality and they are soft enough to not irritate my nose even with quite a few uses in a day.
I would recommend these Kleenex for quality and price.

A spectre is haunting Europe,  wrote Marx and Engels 150 years ago.
They could have also been talking about another phenomenon that swept across Europe and America some 20 years ago.
Punk rock turned up in the seemingly unlikeliest places outside of London and New York.
One of them was Zurich, Switzerland where a small group of women found something liberating and exhilarating in this music that drew them into joining in on the fun.
From about 1978 to 1983, guitarist singer Marlene Marder, bassist singer Klaudia Schiff and a revolving cast of cohorts put out a handful of singles and two albums  Liliput and Some Songs, with the LiLiPuT CD coming out in the early  90 s collecting all of their material  first as Kleenex then later  after a lawsuit  as Liliput.
Kleenex Liliput were wild, funny, almost child-like in the way they played, wrote and sang- the lyrics to  Split  printed above is a prime example.
Though the original LiLiPUT CD and the albums are not in print anymore, Kill Rock Stars reissued all of their material in February 2001.
There is also a book available from Marlene from 1985.
It s a diary made from the time that the group was touring as well as loads of press clippings articles.
It s called THE DIARY OF THE GUITARIST MARLENE MARDER, KLEENEX LILIPUT  which says it all .
It s 230 pages, written in German but there are a lot of interviews, articles, pictures, lyrics and fan letters in English- well worth it for any fan of the band.
If you write her just to tell her how much you enjoy Kleenex Liliput, this will make her happy too.
Supreme thanks to Urs Steiger and Reuben Cervera of Razor and Tie .
PSF: How did Liliput get together?
What made you want to start a band?
Fun!
I was listening to everything- blues, rock and roll.
It started with the punk scene which came over from England.
It s the old story.
We were fed up with the old hippie bands and then the Sex Pistols came over and blah, blah, blah.
We thought it was great fun and it was very easy to play so we did.
It was a small scene where everybody knew everybody.
The only punk bands there was Kleenex and the band I was in  the Nasal Boys .
The other girls knew each other already while I was in another band at the time.
I played in the first punk band in Zurich but I played saxophone there   77 .
I was playing with all these guys and we had this one or two gigs and no one heard the saxophone but it didn t matter- it was just for playing, for fun.
You weren t allowed to have a saxophone in a punk band at the time.
But they weren t the ones who became famous!
Then I decided to go with them  the girls  in a week and they had two songs.
They needed a guitarist.
I used to play guitar when I was a teenager.
So I thought it might be more fun to play with the girls on guitar where you HEARD the guitar than to play with the guys on the saxophone and nobody listened to it.
I liked these two songs very much.
I said  that s the kind of music I can play too,  with only two chords.
PSF: Was it a conscious decision to have a group of all women?
Well, yes and not really.
The guy who was a guitarist in my old band had played with Klaudia  Schifferle, bassist  and Lislot  Ha, drummer .
Then they had the first show and he played the first two songs with them.
But in the meantime I learned the songs also and two others.
After the show, he was fed up and the audience wanted to hear the four songs again   Beri-Beri,   Ain t You,   Hedi s Head,   Nice  .
So he left and I went on stage and that was the beginning of Kleenex.
They had their own band and it was just really by chance- I was there at the right time.
It was really like this punk thing where you just play these three chords and that s it.
We did that.
In the beginning, Lislot didn t know that you can tune a drum kit.
We played like this for a year, without tuned drum kits or a tuned bass or guitar.
The men behaved at that time like they didn t want to play with us.
We just did as we could.
Not serious in the beginning.
PSF: So even when the band started in Zurich, there was an audience there for this music?
Oh yes.
When we started, we just had the four songs and we played for our friends.
It wasn t like it was staged for an audience.
So we played the four songs in fifteen minutes and they d say  go again!
PSF: How did the group come up with songs?
In the beginning, it was me because I was the only one who knew three chords.
I made a harmony like D, G and A and a melody.
But we were all new on our instruments.
PSF: You started with local label, Sunrise.
How did that happen?
Friends.
They thought it was it would be nice to do a single and that was it.
We just thought it would be fun to do the single with our four songs for our friends- the same four songs that we would play at gigs for hours and hours and hours until we get tired.
Then one friend went to England with this single and somehow John Peel got the EP and he played it on the radio over and over.
Rough Trade heard it and that was the contact.
They asked us to do two songs on one single.
The single was done and they were very pleased so they organized a tour for us in England.
It was a great thing.
We didn t expect that at all.
It just went on and on.
PSF: What kind of reception did you get when you came to England?
The audience was GREAT.
I was suprised.
In Switzerland, it was just friends and we would read about us in NME and the single went on the charts.
We just looked at it with great eyes- we had no idea about the music business.
We were on a tour package with the Raincoats and Spizzenergi.
It was a great experience.
With these bands and Gang of Four and Lora Logic, who we all met, they were all part of this English scene.
We were familiar with them- they did the same things  as us  with different sounds but it didn t matter.
It was the same kind, the same idea.
I felt very familar with them.
I still have friends from the Raincoats and Mayo from Red Crayola.
These are friendships for a lifetime and I think it s very great.
PSF: The band went through in a lot of line-up changes.
Why was that?
We re all human beings.
Differences in what the band wanted to do.
For some girls, it was too much.
We were too famous or something else.
I don t know.
Difficulties in what the music should sound like.
Personal stuff.
PSF: A lot of the lyrics were nonsense words languages, semi-english.
What was that about?
Cause we are talking Swiss-German.
That s our mother tongue.
In that time, there wasn t hip-hop or rap in your own words.
Our English isn t that good.
It s a foreign language.
It was nonsense anyway!
We had one or two songs in German.
But these bands now have rap songs here in Swiss-German and I think it s really good.
We tried.
PSF: The band changed names from Kleenex to Liliput.
What s the whole story behind that?
The Kleenex  tissue  company processed a letter from the law.
In the beginning, we were just in Zurich, Switzerland and we never thought that we would go abroad.
Then in England, the Kleenex company found out about us and they didn t like it for us to have their name in connection.
They said we had to change our name or otherwise they will call Rough Trade to destroy all the records and we couldn t sell them anymore.
We had to pay thousands of Swiss francs for this so we had to decide to change the name.
Also, our singer  Regula Sing  left and then we thought it doesn t matter that she left.
We just had to find another singer so we had to get another name.
We just found a new name in 24 hours.
Maybe we thought we were city indians or small like Liliput, little girls.
It s not a bad name anyway.
PSF: It took a number of years to get the first album out.
Any reason for that?
The money maybe.
I think that we weren t THAT interested.
But it s very expensive to do an album.
Our friends made it possible.
For the first singles, we paid on our own.
Everybody put the money in.
For an LP, it s more expensive.
Rough Trade asked and they paid so we did it.
Also, because we had these changes.
That s why it took so long.
PSF: What do you think of that first  self-titled  record?
I still like it.
It s a change because it s a different area, a different time.
We were more serious.
It wasn t Kleenex with the four songs.
We knew a bit more about the music business but not about studios.
We took a chance.
We had the time  then  to do this.
In the beginning, we didn t have enough songs to an album.
Maybe Iron Butterfly could do that but not us- they filled an LP side with one song, but our songs where between 2-3 minutes and we didn t have that many songs.
PSF: During this time, did you find that there was a supportive scene in Switzerland for what the band was doing?
Did other bands like Liliput start up?
We had great support.
In Zurich, it all started with this youth riot   80 .
There were a lot of band which were tougher than we were.
I think everybody thought it was OK, what we did.
When we started, we had a rehearsal room in a factory and we shared it with other bands.
They wanted them to listen to us and what we thought of their music.
Sometimes we took them with us to support us at concerts.
I was a bit older than the people in the riots.
But it s a small town and there were these political questions and we had to say what we thought.
So we got involved in it and we were interested in it.
PSF: Do you think this was reflected in the band s songs?
Yes, I think so.
We didn t have songs like  Fuck the System  like other bands had.
At the end, it was also a political message to our situation in this town.
Everybody saw this.
We didn t throw stones and smash windows.
We stood there and played songs.
Like  Eisiger Wind,  it was like  icy wind  was in this time and it meant this situation in the town.
I think we were very political, looking back.
That s my personal view.
I never go to violent demonstrations but I see what s going on.
So I think maybe it s better that I could write it in a song with some words.
Though it sounds like nonsense words, it always had to do with the situation.
PSF: What other kind of elements were important in the songs?
It was just life.
Very simple.
The life we re living, this band, going on tour suddenly and to read about you in music papers.
Everybody knew more than yourself.
PSF: As Liliput got international attention, did that effect the band at all?
No, because we were always a step behind.
We read  Liliput is a sensation  and we d say  Oh, we are?
We learned this from the media.
For ourselves, it was never sensational.
For example, Greil Marcus wrote about dadaism with us.
I  had no idea about it.
I knew this had been in Zurich but I never made the point for Liliput to have this.
In the end, I guess there is a connection because I read it in many books.
At the time, I didn t see that.
If dadaism was around in France and I didn t live there, it wouldn t be a connection.
But because it was in Zurich and we lived there, they thought it may be a connection.
Now it s in every article about us so there MUST be a connection.
But we didn t feel that way then.
PSF: With the second  last  album, how was it different from the first album?
Well, there were new songs.
On the second album, we had more people on guests for piano and drums.
There was more experience behind it in the time in your life and working in the studio and working on the songs.
More feeling, I think.
I don t know if I prefer the second one better.
PSF: Why did the group break up after that?
The idea from Rough Trade Germany for the second album was for us to tour.
But then Astrid  Spirit, singer  got pregnant and that was the end of the group.
The classic end.
It was her decision, she wanted to be 100% for the baby as she had been 100% for the band.
So, that was it.
From the time of the last album, Klaudia and me wanted to stop the band because we were a bit tired with going on tour and everything.
I thought it was OK as long as she did the business.
I did it all the time  before  and I was tired of it- with the record companies and the money.
So we had to go on tour and organize this and so on.
Then she came to us and said  Now I m pregnant.
Sorry girls.
Goodbye.
I wasn t really disappointed.
It was kind of an end.
PSF: What were you doing just after Liliput broke up?
I started a record store with some friends.
Urs had the Off Course label for a long time and he was the one who got Kleenex to do the single first.
Now he s up in the mountains snow-boarding with a clothes shop.
In the shop, I sold records and did book-keeping.
After we split the band, I worked with them and had a good time with the new music and new stuff.
Later, I had a band later on called Danger Mice, from  89 to  92.
That was great fun.
That was a good band.
By then, I had experience and we were three women, old ladies doing rock and roll on stage late in the night.
At the end, it was too much, it was too old, doing the same thing.
I m not Tina Turner.
But this band was really fun, not serious.
We did it for our pleasure and there was no ambition to be famous.
We played every weekend in Switzerland.
It was hard rock and we were just crazy girls.
PSF: What did you do after this band?
I started my own agency.
I worked for Swiss groups and organzied tours and festivals for international bands.
In the last two years, I ve worked at a jazz club with promotion and administration and driving the bands to the airport.
I think without Kleenex I wouldn t be at the point I am at now.
PSF: In the  90 s, a collection came out with all the songs from Kleenex and Liliput.
How did that come together?
I made it.
It was my idea.
I had all these tapes and things so I wanted to have everything on a CD.
Then I could put all my collections out from tapes like a big finish.
I felt good to hear this.
There were a lot of songs that I said  Oh!
I didn t know that before.
I think Klaudia made nice pictures for this  the sleeve art work .
PSF: Do you ever get the urge to play again?
No, I m just not in the mood.
I m not going to hang ads in music stores, looking for musicians.
I m happy now with my new work.
I had to think about this.
I thought that the music was over so I had to find something new to do with the same energy and motivation.
I now work with WWF  World Wide Fund for Nature .
I do their house magazine and freelance for now.
I m going back to school soon to study pollution control.
I found that culture is one thing and what I m doing  now  is another thing.
But I found that these things are really close because I m meeting a lot of people that I knew before so it s not a crack between these two professional.
It s a logical way if you re fed up or finished with culture, then you do this kind of work.
PSF: How you look back at the band?
What are you most pleased about with Kleenex Liliput?
I think it was a good time.
It was long and important time in my life.
I wouldn t be at this point now without the band.
What I m pleased about it now is that I can still be interviewed about this group!

I have a definite need for tissues as my sinuses are either stuffed or runny daily.
The Kleenex tissues are a good quality tissue and if you do the math this tissue deal is the best tissue for the price.
I would like to see the price lower because I use quite a few every day, but I have looked in stores and online and the rollback price on these tissues makes it the best deal I have seen.
Plus Kleenex tissues are dependable quality and they are soft enough to not irritate my nose even with quite a few uses in a day.
I would recommend these Kleenex for quality and price.

These Kleenex Hand Towels are disposable, single use items designed to keep you clean.
Each single-ply white towel is made with absorbent fibers to help wipe away and lock-in dirt.
These Kleenex towels, 60 count, are free from any inks, dyes or fragrances.
For appearance purposes, I like to keep a set of nice quality, matched towels in the bathroom.
At the same time, I like the idea of having a fresh towel for every use.
My bathroom is quite small and there are limited towel racks.
Kleenex Hand Towels are the perfect solution.
They are sturdy and soft, and by putting them upside down on one end of the towel rack, they stay in place and are easy to get after washing my hands or splashing off my face.
This way the  decorator  towels don t get used, and I dont need to have  everyday  handtowels available.
I make sure to always have a supply of Kleenex Hand Towels available!

Pour le groupe de rock suisse, voir Liliput .
Kleenex est une marque déposée par Kimberly-Clark Corporation , fabricant entre autres de mouchoirs en papiers, et qui est rentrée par antonomase dans le langage courant pour désigner un mouchoir jetable en papier.
Ce nom a vraisemblablement été construit à partir du mot anglais clean , en changeant la manière de l orthographier  pour une prononciation identique  et en lui ajoutant un suffixe.
Le côté pratique et hygiénique des mouchoirs jetables a complètement détrôné les mouchoirs en tissu, qui étaient de plus peu hygiéniques.
De nos jours on ne trouve pratiquement plus ces derniers.
C’est après la Première Guerre mondiale que l’entreprise Kimberly-Clark, basée dans le Wisconsin aux États-Unis , crée des feuilles en cellulose , une matière utilisée au départ pour les pansements.
Les premiers « mouchoirs » en papier sont commercialisés en 1924 comme produits absorbants destinés au démaquillage sous le nom de Kleenex, une combinaison phonétique de « cleansing »  « nettoyage »  réduit à « clean » et de « ex » qui vient du produit précédent de la marque, prémisse des serviettes hygiéniques jetables et nommé Kotex  .
La boite de Kleenex avec sa fente sur le dessus pour permettre la distribution des feuilles est lancée sur le marché en 1928 et s’impose rapidement sur le territoire américain  .
Ce n est qu en 1930 que le produit commence à être vendu comme mouchoir jetable  .
Arrivent ensuite différentes variations comme les mouchoirs de couleurs différentes.
En 1932, les paquets de mouchoirs de poche sont à leur tour en vente  .
Après la Seconde Guerre mondiale , Kleenex investit d’autres marchés en Europe et sur les autres continents.
Parallèlement, la marque commercialise également et c’est une innovation, les couches culottes jetables.
En France, c’est en 1960 que débarquent les premiers mouchoirs Kleenex  .
Pour conquérir le jeune public, la marque imprime les héros de l’époque sur ses mouchoirs, le résultat est immédiat, les ventes décollent.
En 1999, nouvelle innovation pour la marque Kleenex qui lance le « Balsam », un mouchoir spécial « rhume et allergies ».
Ce mouchoir aide à calmer les irritations dues à l’utilisation intensive des mouchoirs.
Enfin Kleenex lance à la même époque le Kleenex menthol qui permet de dégager les voies respiratoires.
20 millions de mouchoirs Kleenex par an en France, sachant qu un consommateur moyen français utilise 160 mouchoirs par an alors qu un américain en utilise 1 200 sur la même période.

The aim for any social media campaign is to create a reaction, and later interactions, but exactly how successful these campaigns are is another matter entirely.
Although there s no real way of measuring success in terms of sales, but that doesn t stop some agencies from trying to be creative.
Israeli agency Smoyz searched through Facebook to find status updates which showed those that were feeling under the weather.
Once they selected 50 people from the status updates, they acquired their addresses from their friends and prepared special Kleenex kits to help them get better.
Once the addresses were acquired and the kits delivered, the selected people then posted up their news showing their surprise and delight at the development.
Of all of those who received the kit, all 50 people posted a photo of it on their Facebook page which is an impressive statistic.
This meant that numerous comments, likes and reactions came from their friends, getting the message out there and promoting the brand.
Another development was that people began looking for their own kit, meaning more interaction with the Kleenex brand on Facebook and further promotion.
From just 50 kits, Kleenex obtained over 650,000 impressions and 1,800 interactions highlighting the success of the campaign.

A very funny Amazon review for multipacks of Kleenex is allegedly  A mother s struggle,  describing the travails of living with three teenage boys who ve discovered the miracle of self-pleasuring   If I don t supply absorbent paper products, I m going to find my dish towels hidden in the basement, stiff as aluminum. The other day, I almost cut my hand on a sock  .
However, the  mother  who wrote the review is called  James Otis Thatch,  so, possibly, too good to be true.
But funny!
This is how it goes in this house.
First the Kleenex disappears.
Then the toilet paper.
Then they go for fabrics.
And you don t want it to get there, unless you re ready to invest in a five gallon drum of Fabreeze.
This used to be a good Christian home.
But it s not about moral judgment anymore.
I m way beyond that.
I m in survival mode.
If I don t supply absorbent paper products, I m going to find my dish towels hidden in the basement, stiff as aluminum.
The other day, I almost cut my hand on a sock.
I am sorry to speak so frankly, but with three teenage boys, a woman has got to be practical.
The funny part is, they think they re being sneaky, with their 45 minute showers and sudden need for  privacy , as if I m going to walk in on them journaling.
They slink around the house like unfixed cats, while I try to announce my location at all times.
No one needs to ask me to knock anymore.
I knock on the walls.
I practically wear a cow bell.
I m not looking to catch anyone by surprise, believe me.
I m just trying to get through this.

The Kleenex Xperiments campaign asked middle school students to perform experiments using Kleenex tissues and posted the results online.
Just in time for back to school season, tissue brand Kleenex is demonstrating the strength of its product in Kleenex Xperiments, a campaign that asked science students to conduct experiments using Kleenex Everyday Tissues and filmed the results.
According to Kleenex, the brand reached out to more than 100 schools that excel in math and science and asked 10 to participate in the program.
These schools challenged their 4th to 8th grade students to use critical thinking to show how the brand s  thicker, more absorbent Kleenex Everyday Tissues  hold up against challenges like sneezes, nose blows, and runny noses.
Kleenex says all methods and ideas were fair game from testing hypotheses using everyday classroom equipment to building elaborate contraptions.
The brand ultimately helped five of the 10 schools bring their experiments to life and captured the effort on video, which can be seen on the Kleenex Xperiments site .
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy in Saginaw, Mich.
For each experiment, the site includes tips, facts, videos, photos, quotes, and sketches, as well as the ability to share on Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
According to Kleenex, the effort allows kids to see how Kleenex  can help keep the wet stuff off their hands  and inspires them to practice healthy tissue habits.
It also prominently features Kleenex Everyday Tissues, which the brand says are now 15 percent thicker and more absorbent.
In exchange for their participation, Kleenex says the 10 schools will receive $5,000 worth of Box Tops for Education, which they can use for textbooks, playground equipment, supplies, field trips, and classroom parties.

Titled “A Mother’s Struggle,” this hilarious Amazon  review  is probably better than most actual commercials for Kleenex tissues.
You can really feel the trauma this everyday mom from a “good Christian home” has to go through to keep up with her three teenage sons’ Kleenex habit.
I want to start this off by thanking Kleenex for selling these in 36-packs,” writes the long-suffering mom.
I ve put it on subscription, and if they want to start selling a 72-pack, sign me up.

The review is so funny that you probably won’t be disappointed to learn that it’s not really true.
It seems to have been written by a guy named  James Thach , a serial Amazon reviewer whose recent  fake  purchases include  Ann Coulter’s latest book  and the new  John Mayer album .
A sample for the latter:  “Since my husband Brad s unspeakable accident, I have been left with certain needs--for companionship, understanding and emotional fulfillment.
The Kleenex review may have been written as a joke, but it still seems to be resonating with some real moms.
As one Amazon commenter wrote, “As the mother of 2 teenage boys this had me in stitches.
Best review ever!

Right before the outbreak of World War I, the Kimberly-Clark  Corporation trademarked Cellucotton, an absorbent substitute for cotton  that is derived from cellulose, which, in turn, comes largely from wood  pulp.
With cotton in short supply during the war, Cellucotton was widely  used as a battlefield bandage.
At the end of the war, the company  pondered what to do with the huge surpluses of Cellucotton bulging out  its warehouses.
One idea came from army nurses who had already discovered  Cellucotton’s usefulness as a feminine napkin, which Kimberly-Clark  began marketing in 1920 as Kotex.
Ads  featured actors like Helen Hayes and Ronald Colman removing makeup the  “scientific way” with the Kleenex Kerchiefs.
But the public had other  ideas and began to adopt the cold cream removers as a disposable  handkerchief.
That underground use grew even more rapidly when the  company started packaging Kleenex in the “Serv-a-Tissue,” the new pop-up  tissue box invented by Andrew Olsen.
Only in the early 1930s did Kimberly-Clark finally begin to market  Kleenex as disposable handkerchiefs.
For good measure, the company also  began to suggest other possible uses from polishing furniture to  removing the grease from french fries.

Pandora is testing promoted stations with music and ads picked by brands like Kleenex and Taco Bell, which will show up in some listeners  lists of  Stations You Might Like,  the company said Wednesday.
Since launching as online radio more than a decade ago, Pandora has grown to become the most frequented music service on the Internet, currently at 76 million monthly active users.
Getting comfortable in that perch, Pandora has lately been investing heavily in its advertising capabilities.
The company aims to improve its ad  tools and swipe some of the bigger advertising budget going to traditional radio now that its more secure in holding a large audience s attention.
The promoted stations are Pandora s latest ad experiment.
Brands involved in the beta launch include Kleenex, Skechers, StubHub, Taco Bell, and Toyota Motor Sales, and the brands will act like executive producers of their stations to create a musical personality, Pandora said.
Tokyo Police Club, while Kleenex has country songs by artists such as Jason Aldean and Kelly Pickler .
The brands also control the ad load on their stations, so how many ads you hear in an hour will vary between them.
About 10 percent of Pandora listeners will see the branded stations show up in their  Stations You Might Like  listing, showing up one at a time.
Targeting stations to the most relevant Pandora listeners won t apply at the beta stage, but a Pandora spokeswoman said serving up advertising that is both relevant to the user and effective for the advertiser is a key focus.
For the time being, beta phase listeners themselves must choose to add a promoted station, and Pandora is increasing those stations  visibility once they do.

Pañuelo desdoblado bajo un paquete de Kleenex.
La marca Veltie es producida por Kimberly-Clark.
Los pañuelos desechables producidos por Kimberly-Clark están hechos de un material inventado por esta compañía durante la Primera Guerra Mundial , de nombre  cellucotton .
Fueron usados originalmente en máscaras anti-gas , como reemplazo al algodón , pues era requerido en la industria del vestido.
La corporación Kimberly-Clark creó el primer pañuelo facial en 1924 y anunciado como un producto para limpieza de maquillaje y crema.
A los pocos años después de su introducción al mercado, la compañía recibió cartas de clientes sugiriendo su uso contra el resfriado común y la rinitis alérgica.
En los años 1930 , su uso como pañuelo desechable se extendió, por lo que la compañía creó el eslogan  Don t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket    no lleves un resfriado en tu bolsillo  .
La popularidad del producto ha llevado a que en algunos países la palabra kleenex sea usada para referirse a cualquier pañuelo desechable, independientemente de su marca.
En los mencionados países, Kleenex es una marca que ha pasado al uso común .
Algunos diccionarios, como el Oxford, han incluido la palabra, definiéndola como tal.

Second only to snow day, experiment day was the best in elementary school.
We got to see the legendary combination of Mentos and Coca-Cola, drop eggs off of roofs, and bake cookies in solar ovens.
The 90 minutes flew by.
Kleenex and Studiocom, the latter of which recently gave us the “Hand Washing Station” for the Kimberly-Clark brand, channeled this concept into their latest campaign, proving Kleenex’s added strength and absorbency with Kleenex Xperiments.
They challenged 100 elementary and middle schools across the country.
10 accepted, and 5 were featured in the resulting videos.
I’m guessing these kids were stoked to have more than the usual one-per-unit experiment day.
Brand X broke after 8 yolks, while Kleenex withstood the weight of 32 yolks.
That’s a lot of representative mucus.
It’s clear that the kids involved in these projects had fun being inventive, and  perhaps due to the brand’s selectivity  their experiments showcased Kleenex’s upgrade.
A good time was had by all, and I bet–at the very least–when these kids grow up to be parents, they’ll remember their results and buy Kleenex, not Brand X.

Someone call Jeff in marketing and tell him about the 72-pack concept!
Because our relationship with you, our readers, is based on a foundation of mutual admiration and respect, we re going to go ahead and tell you right off the bat that this review of Kleenex tissues isn t real.
It was written by James O.
Thach , who has written a lot of other funny reviews on Amazon.
Here, for example, is his review for an  Infant Circumcision Trainer  White   and it s almost as hilariously disturbing as an infant circumcision trainer.
That said, he s unfortunately probably right in assuming that a lot of people buying a 36-pack of Kleenex aren t just being thrifty.

Cannes, 18th June, 2013:  Mindshare, the global media agency network, has been awarded the Gold Media Lion in Cannes for Kimberly-Clark’s Kleenex Adaptive Marketing campaign in the UK.
Mindshare, which picked up eight Media Lions overall - one gold, one silver and five bronze - and one PR Bronze Lion, created a completely new approach to media planning for the tissue brand and the campaign has been recognized by the Cannes Media Lions Jury as setting a Gold standard for modern media planning.
By taking slow moving data on historical flu outbreaks, sourced from the NHS  the UK national healthcare service , and mixing it with fast moving data garnered from Google ad words auctions on keywords linked to illness such as ‘flu remedy’, Mindshare was able to adapt the media spend on the Kleenex winter flu campaign by geographic region in real time – only planning media where there was a live flu outbreak.
By combining the data streams through an adaptive planning interface, Mindshare was able to direct media spend with 96% accuracy to infected areas, selling an extra 500,000 boxes of tissues and increasing sales by 40% in the first two months of the campaign year-on-year.
The multi-award winning campaign  also a Festival of Media Global Winner for Best Targeted Campaign   was recognized alongside other Mindshare work in Cannes including campaigns for Unilever, Nike, American Express, HSBC, Sky and Heineken.
Mindshare also celebrated in the Young Media Lions with Cynthia Soledad Recchi and Victoria Iviglia from Mindshare Argentina awarded a Bronze Young Media Lion.
Nick Emery, Global CEO, Mindshare said: ‘This is validation in our belief that an adaptive approach to media is the future of our industry.
We live in a world where everything begins and ends in media, and in that rich data environment it is those agencies that can adapt to the consumer and technology changes the fastest and most intelligently that will win.
The Media Lions Awards followed Mindshare’s Cannes Seminar with McLaren F1 Racing featuring McLaren Chairman Ron Dennis, F1 Driver Jenson Button and a live on-stage pit stop – How to be more adaptive and why it’ll make you more creative.
Kleenex® tissue revolutionized many different practices worldwide.
Kleenex is a brand of tissue invented to clean up waste products of the act of masturbation , otherwise known as The Great American Pastime .
The product is produced by Kimberly-Clark, who also manufacture the companion product, Lubriderm® lotion.
The name “Kleenex” is derived from the product’s intended purpose, to clean  Kleen-  up after autoerotic sex  -ex .
The sock was the standard post-masturbatory aid prior to the launch of Kleenex tissues.
Prior to the introduction of Kleenex, it was standard for a man to use a dirty sock or socks  preferably white so your mom can’t tell  to remove testicular wastes from bodies after wrestling with the tube snake.
This practice continues in impoverished areas of the world where Kleenex is not available or affordable, and is occasionally still used in developed countries in a pinch, and especially in a failure to pinch.
The history of Kleenex dates to 1945, when chronic masturbators Joe Kimberly and Bob Clark shared their mutual frustration with the use of the sock for cleaning up and began researching with paper products to meet the goal of developing a dry yet absorbent disposable wipe for clean-up which could be packaged for ready use and sold to their fellow man.
Experimenting on a 3:1 mayonnaise and water stand-in, they settled upon the material that they would later patent as Kleenex.
Launched in 1949, the first-generation Kleenex consisted of a single-ply tissue that could be easily dispensed from a box using one hand.
The latter feature was key to end-user satisfaction, in that a non-soiled hand could be used to reach for a waiting Kleenex tissue, while the soiled hand awaited cleansing.
Within one year, boxes of Kleenex tissues appeared in homes and college dormitories around the globe, generally located next to beds, toilets, TVs, and other places in the home where meat was most frequently beat.
Since the mid-1990s and the expansion of the pornography-choked internet, the Kleenex box has been found next to personal computers with increasing frequency.
By the late 1940s, women began to notice boxes of Kleenex tissue distributed stragetically around their homes.
Women gradually found the tissues of use, primarily for a practice called  nose blowing .
In this act, women held a Kleenex tissue tightly below their noses to remove mucus from the nasal turbinates.
Men were stunned, as they generally believed that the shirtsleeve was invented for this purpose.
They were also disturbed by this unnatural use of the product, which threatened their personal supply of available tissue for its primary purpose.
Despite the immediate global success of Kleenex, customers occasionally complained of the sheer number of Kleenex tissues and resulting labor that was required for their average post-masturbatory clean-up task.
Responding to this customer demand, Clark, head of R&D at the time, developed a manufacturing method which allowed two sheets of Kleenex tissue to lightly adhere together.
In experiments conducted in the mayonnaise and water laboratory  “The Mayo Clinic” , this revolutionary “2-ply” tissue provided greatly increased absorbance and clean-up power over the first generation product.
It was estimated that the average 17-year old could wipe up and dispose of his love potion  assuming a volume of 2 ml  using five 2-ply tissues per session, compared to 7-10 single-ply sheets.
On the strength of these findings, Kimberly-Clark launched a 200-tissue 2-ply “pop-up” box that became the standard in men’s households worldwide.
Based upon the consumption estimate of 5-tissues per nut, the company calculated that its 200-tissue box would provide sufficient resources to clean-up after approximately two weeks of chicken chokings for the average teenager.
Corresponding with the groundbreaking introduction of Playboy magazine in 1953, ever hornier consumers demanded more from Kimberly-Clark, this time requesting that more tissues per box be provided.
The company responded in due time with the 400 tissue box, which was the standard size available until the video cassette recorder became widely available in the late 1970s to early 1980s.
This event further drove demand for Kleenex, owing to the fact that like all new media technologies, the purpose of the VCR was to more easily provide pornography to the masses.
At this point in their history, Kimberly suggested development of a portable Kleenex packet “for the wanker on the go”.
The resulting “Pocket Pack” product was introduced and remains popular with commuters, business travelers, and long haul truck drivers.
A 500-tissue box was introduced and was successfully marketed worldwide until approximately 1994 when the internet became a household convenience via the technology of personal computer networking.
All bets were off at this point, as porn poured 24-7 into the homes of insatiably horny males like Lake Pontchartrain into New Orleans.
This strained product development efforts at Kimberly-Clark, who within a year managed to supply the market with an astounding 1000-tissue box.

This spring, we reached out to more than 100 schools across the country that excel in math and science, and invited 10 to take part in an exciting new program: Kleenex Xperiments.
The assignment?
Challenge their 4th -- 8th grade classes to use their critical thinking skills to show how now thicker, more absorbent Kleenex® Everyday Tissues stand up to the wet stuff created by sneezes, nose blows, runny noses and more.
All methods and ideas were fair game, from testing their hypotheses using everyday classroom objects, to building elaborate custom contraptions!
All 10 schools came up with amazing ideas, and in the end, we helped five of them bring their experiments to life—all while capturing it on video.
Thanks to their creativity and hard work, kids everywhere will see how Kleenex® Tissue can help keep the wet stuff off their hands, and be inspired to practice healthy tissue habits in school and at home!

An eponym is someone or something whose name is or is thought to be the source of something s name  such as a city, country, era, or product ; alternately it can be used to refer to the name of something that is based on or derived from someone or something else s name.
Albert Einstein is the eponym of the element einsteinium; conversely, einsteinium is an eponym of Albert Einstein.
There are many different types of eponyms, especially in scientific fields.
Theories, laws, equations, proofs, and elements often have their eponyms in the people that first discovered or proved them.
Proprietary eponyms are another matter entirely.
These are general words that are, or were at one time, proprietary brand names or service marks.
Kleenex, for example, is a brand of facial tissues, yet the word is used today to refer to facial tissues of any brand.
Xerox is a brand of photocopy machine; that word, too, has been since adopted to refer to any brand of photocopy machine and, moreover, also employed as a verb to describe the act of photocopying.
As this illustrates, although brand names are proper adjectives  as in,  Kleenex facial tissues  , when such terms are adopted for general use they tend to become nouns and often also verbs.
Some proprietary eponyms are given below.
Where two spellings are given, the first spelling is the version in common use, while the second, parenthesized spelling refers to the original product name or service mark.
Nylon is often thought of to be a trademark, but in fact it never was.
Special mention must be made of Spam, a product and trademark of Hormel Foods Corp.
Rather than broadening by common use to refer to all brands of canned smoked ham and pork instead of just the original brand, the term spam took on a completely different meaning: unsolicited commercial email or electronic postings, usually sent indiscriminately to vast numbers of recipients.

Kimberly-Clark has battled Greenpeace over recycled fibers in products.
By Ylan Q.
The battle over the environment has found a new front: the inside of a Kleenex box.
New York by a stuffy-nosed reporter.
The not-so-secret secret is that Kimberly-Clark has been fighting with Greenpeace for nearly three years over recycled fibers in its products.
Greenpeace says the company is destroying the boreal forest of Canada; Kimberly-Clark says it has begun testing new tissues made with recycled materials.
But the bigger mystery is how the leaflet got into the box.
David Dickson, a spokesman for Kimberly-Clark.
He then called corporate security.
Dickson said the company has received a handful of calls about the leaflets.
None of the leaflet incidents could be confirmed, he said.
In one case, a caller complained about the leaflets but left a telephone number that led to a Greenpeace office.
The note found by a reporter purportedly came from Greenpeace and referred to its nearly three-year  Kleercut  campaign against the company, which has included disrupting Kleenex commercials as they were being taped in a public area and driving around in a truck shaped like a giant Kleenex box.
Greenpeace s forests campaigner, Rolf Skar, said the leaflet tactic was not officially sanctioned.
Skar said.
Greenpeace has many vigilante supporters who sometimes take issues into their own hands, Skar said, adding that he has heard of targeted boxes in the United States and Canada.
It was unclear if the leaflets were put in the boxes at stores or during the manufacturing process.
Dickson dismissed the idea of a Greenpeace mole in one of Kimberly-Clark s plants.
Tissues are packed into boxes at the rate of 250 to 300 per minute, and any deviation would slow the process and set off alarms, he said.
The leaflets may be part of a trend known as  shopdropping,  in which people leave items at a store, the reverse of shoplifting.
Items left on store shelves have included the business cards of personal trainers tucked into weight-loss books and CDs of unsigned musicians.
A reporter was able to slide a folded piece of paper underneath the perforated cardboard of an unopened box of Kleenex.
With a little manipulating, it may be possible to insert the paper so that it lies on top of the tissues.
Dickson was dubious.

Kimberly-Clark has announced a new Kleenex brand facial tissue designed to kill viruses that cause colds and the flu.
Strong enough to stand up to a cold or flu virus, but gentle enough for everyday use, Kleenex Brand Anti-Viral tissue will begin shipping in late August and will be available at retail outlets throughout the United States by early October 2004.
The Anti-Viral tissue uses a patented, three-ply tissue with a moisture-activated middle layer that is treated with an anti-viral formula.
9% of cold and flu viruses* in the tissue within 15 minutes.
The formula is made from citric acid and sodium lauryl sulphate, common ingredients found in everyday consumer products.
Citric acid is used as a flavouring agent in soft drinks, while sodium lauryl sulphate is found in many shampoos and detergents.
Most consumers don t realize that colds and the flu traditionally spread in different ways.
Cold viruses are generally transferred through the hands when we touch something or someone infected with these germs and then touch our mouth, nose and eyes.
Flu viruses, however, are usually transmitted through droplets coughed or sneezed into the air.


Isaac Mizrahi on His Kleenex Design Collaboration and His Favorite Housewives Franchise!
Isaac Mizrahi says he likes to make products that could enhance a woman’s life.
It’s safe to say the designer has succeeded on that goal, right?
From his cheerfully patterned loafers to his staple A-line party dresses in decadent candy-colored tones to his magic behind Tweezerman’s latest printed tweezer collection, Isaac creates more than happiness.
It’s pure euphoria.
Now, the designer has teamed up with Kleenex for their 90th anniversary to create fashion-forward tissue boxes for women to accessorize their homes with.
We chatted with Isaac about this exciting collaboration and picked his mind on the stylish happenings in the world of pop culture.
Oh, and like us, Isaac is a Housewives fan.
Take a look below!
OK!
Magazine: Can you tell me how you got involved with Kleenex’s 90th Anniversary Design?
Isaac Mizrahi: My brand, which is going to be 30 years old in about two years, is a brand that has developed a look.
I am always interested in creating these partnerships with other brands that I think an American consumer really equates with quality—something that makes her life better.
The idea that is that this incredible brand, Kleenex, which is 90-years-old, and my brand are getting together to create this product which, somehow, enables a woman to express herself even on that level.
Something that is kind of available and friendly as a tissue!
I think it’s really important for a woman to develop a personal style in the way that she picks out her clothes and the way she prepares her hair or makeup.
I think it’s the same thing with the things she surrounds herself in her bedroom or boudoir.
Those things lend a little bit of color, pattern, or humor to a situation.
What look were you going for?
I love the oval shape.
I think that’s so cool.
IM: Me too.
The thing that I was thinking is that it should somehow relate to my spring collection.
And a lot of the patterns, prints, and colors that I do lend themselves really well to these types of products.
So what we did was take our favorite prints and adapted them, whether it’s the tile print, floral print, or that kind of abstract animal print.
Tissues make us think of tear-jerker movies.
You’d have them on the couch when you’re watching a good movie.
Do you have any favorites?
IM: Of course!
The ones I like the best are really old.
There’s a movie called Now Voyageur.
Basically, I like old Bette Davis movies because they’re all tear-jerkers.
I like Now Voyageur and Dark Victory.
You’ve made appearances on a ton of TV shows, including Project Runway .
What are your favorite TV shows that are on right now?
IM: Well, I’m sort of a sucker for a Housewife .
I do love a Real Housewife a lot.
What franchise is your favorite?
IM: I’ve always been a big Atlanta fan.
I’ve always been a big Beverly Hills fan.
New York is back, and I haven’t begun watching it, but I probably will tomorrow.
You are working with Kleenex, and you’ve worked with Tweezerman .
What product would you want to makeover next?
IM: The things I use the most in my world are the things I want to think about the most.
I’ve always wanted to redo a bicycle because I think I could bring so much to that product.
Since we are talking about TV, is there a show on now that you’d love to make an appearance on?
IM: I would love to make an appearance on Modern Family and or The Good Wife .
I really want to make an appearance on The Good Wife.
Magazine: You designed costumes for “The Magic Flute” for the Opera Theatre of St.
Do you have any movies from this past year that you think did a really great job in that department?
IM: I really loved American Hustle .
I think the costumes in that movie were very special.
What do you think about costume design on TV right now?
They really get the rich business woman thing.
Between Christine Baranski and Julianna Margulies, they really do a great job of giving us this “rich lawyer” thing.
Are there any celebrities that you’re loving for their personal style?
IM: There are so many.
The one that I keep saying looks so good all the time is Charlize Theron .
She‘s flawless.
Another one is Jennifer Lawrence .
I think she looks good all the time, too.
I love  Carey Mulligan .
I thinks she has an offbeat style.
What are your favorite tear-jerker movies?
Do you live The Real Housewives of Atlanta like Isaac?
Will you pick up a box of his Kleenex designs?

Catalog No.
Kleenex is one of the most   productive females in the catalog, with at least seven calves born to her thus far—in 1977, 1981, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2005.
You can see her family tree here .
Of the five right   whale critical habitats  or conservation zones , she has been seen in all   but Cape Cod Bay.
In 2002, she took a bit of a summer swim-about and traveled up   to the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, which is an area occasionally visited by other   right whales.
Kleenex is a virtual poster child for right whale research.
Besides the more   than 20 years of photo-documentation, scientists have used just about every tool   in their toolbox to learn about her.
In 1990, scientists from New England   Aquarium collected a skin sample from her, which allowed geneticists from   McMaster and Trent Universities to later determine the father of two of her   calves.
In 2001, researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution  WHOI    attached a suction cup tag to her back to determine how she behaved while   swimming below the water’s surface.
That same year, another team from WHOI used   a novel technique to determine her blubber thickness.
They approached her with   an ultrasound device attached to a very long pole.
By lightly touching her back   with the device, they were able to measure the thickness of her blubber.
Blubber   thickness seems to be important in determining whether a female will give birth,   and may be an indicator of overall right whale health.
In a related project, scientists from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center    a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA    used a special, large-format camera installed in the belly of an airplane to   measure her length and girth from the air.
Lastly, New England Aquarium   researchers collected a fecal sample from Kleenex while she swam with her calf   in the Bay of Fundy.
Such samples reveal a tremendous amount about a whale.
As technology advances, so does   our ability to learn about these mysterious animals.
