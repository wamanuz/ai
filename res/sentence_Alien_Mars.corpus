We already know that the spiders from Mars are real -- but has the NASA rover Curiosity picked up real evidence of extraterrestrial life on the Red Planet?
Some of these photos -- taken by the Curiosity over the past year and on other missions to Mars -- look a lot like rocks.
Take a look, and wage alien war on the topic in the comments below.
Curious about images like this, which appear to show either camouflaged or fossilized lizards running around on Mars.
NASA s Mars rover Curiosity shot a photo of this little guy earlier this year.
The conspiracies go back to July 25, 1976, when this shot of the  Face on Mars  was taken by an orbiter.
These are real photos taken of Mars  surface.
A former US Marine has claimed he spent 17 years of his career on MARS.

Moving Rock On Mars!
More than two years into the Curiosity rover’s lonely trek across Mars, conspiracy theorists believe they’ve struck gold: an ‘alien thigh bone’ has been spotted on the surface of the red planet.
For keen alien hunters, the image above - taken by the rover’s MastCam on August 14 – is proof that large animals once roamed Mars, possibly even dinosaurs.
Simply put this shows that there were some living things on the Mars  sic ,” asserts an anonymous editorial writer at Northern Voices Online , while the popular site UFO Blogger compares the find to previous images of a “ fossilized, reptilian spine ” and a “ human finger ”.
The regularity of these ‘finds’ is of course testament not to the once-flourishing wildlife of Mars, but to the human brain’s remarkable capacity to spot patterns in random noise.
Of course, there is some truth to conspiracy theorists’ hopes of life on Mars, with scientists pointing out last year that the asteroid impact that killed of the dinosaurs could have flung rocks carrying organic matter to the red planet some 66 million years ago.
Unfortunately, at this point  and for roughly 3 billion years prior  Mars was a barren place with no flowing water.
The  thigh bone  that was found on Mars is not what it appears to be.
NASA s Curiosity rover captured a photo on Mars that went viral after appearing on a UFO blog.
The image shows fragments on Mars  dirt surface, one particular elongated rock resembling a leg bone.
Seen by Mars rover Curiosity using its MastCam, this Mars rock may look like a femur thigh bone,  NASA writes .
NASA s photo description is a disappointment to fans of extraterrestrials, but this is not the first time people thought there was proof of life on Mars.
Shadow and light in a photo that was taken on the Red Planet made it look like there was a  Face on Mars  in 1976.
The Curiosity rover found concrete evidence that Mars was once habitable; however, no creatures were big enough to leave any fossilized remains.
If life ever existed on Mars, scientist expect that it would be small simple life forms called microbes,  NASA officials writes in the photo description.
Many believe that alien life moved the rock.
It s not the first meteorite found on Mars.
Iron meteorites are eroded much more slowly on Mars than on Earth, thanks to Earth s oxygen-rich atmosphere and overall moistness, while on the Red Planet the only erosive forces that we know about come from wind-blown dust.
Ancient Alien theory has more to the story?
A new photograph from NASAâ€™s Mars Curiosity rover appears to showcase a strong artificial light emanating from the planetâ€™s surface, igniting speculation that the beacon suggests there is intelligent life on the Red Planet.
NASA itself has   not commented on the nature of the light, but UFO watchers have   wasted no time suggesting itâ€™s not natural and, therefore, a sign   of alien life.
Sure NASA could go and investigate it, but hey, they are not   on Mars to discover life, but there to stall its discovery,â€� he concluded.

There are simple explanations for bright spots seen in two recent photos from Mars.
Bright lights, like the one seen here  upper left , appear in images sent from NASA s Mars rover Curiosity nearly every week.
Recent photos taken by NASA s Mars rover might appear to show a gleaming alien bonfire burning in the distance—at least according to some Internet loonies—but that s not exactly what s happening.
Fact is, there still isn t any evidence for life on Mars.
It turns out that both cosmic rays and glinting rocks are pretty common on Mars.
Such rocks have been seen in images sent by several of NASA s Mars rovers, and cosmic rays appear in images that Curiosity sends to Earth each week.
The reason we see so many is because Mars s atmosphere is thinner: It doesn t block as much cosmic radiation as Earth s does.
So would seeing a giant, artificial face on Mars , uncovering alien fossils that hitchhiked to Earth aboard a piece of ejected red planet, or discovering that a shiny, doughnut-shaped rock found by NASA s rover Opportunity is actually alive.
Oh, and you re wrong, there was life detected on Mars years ago, by an approved NASA experiment, however it was down played because there other experiments didn t find the same thing.
Second of all, you speak of possible life on Mars as if it s a far out idea, well why then are we spending all this money on rovers to look for it?
Can you disprove water ice under the sufface of MARS?

Martians are any of a large variety of extraterrestrial beings from the planet Mars .
Numerous Martian species from Edgar Rice Burroughs popular Warlord of Mars series, most notably including Green Martians , Red Martians and Therns , among others.
Barsoomians from Barsoom - their name for the planet Mars from Marvel Comics  adapted from Edgar Rice Burrough s stories mentioned above .
The Yip Yips may actually be from Mars too; however since they have a bumper sticker on their flying saucer that says  Mars  on it, this more likely indicates that they were in fact tourists to the planet.
Martians from Tim Burton s Mars Attacks!
Humanoid Martians from the Walt Disney movie of the same year Mission to Mars.

The alien races in Corridor 7: Alien Invasion seek to take over the planet to use as a staging base to bring a war to Earth, but do not originate from the planet itself and come from elsewhere in the universe  presumably multiple worlds .
NASA has announced that the next Mars rover — currently codenamed Mars 2020 — will be outfitted with an array of sophisticated, upgraded scientific instruments that will let it delve deeper and farther than Curiosity, with the hope that it will be able to uncover signs of life on Mars.
Perhaps even more excitingly, Mars 2020 will also be equipped with a new instrument that can convert the carbon dioxide in Mars’ atmosphere into oxygen — this is of utmost importance if humanity ever colonizes Mars — and another instrument that will gather and store Martian rock samples for eventual return to Earth.
If you haven’t followed the Mars 2020 story, I suggest you read our original story detailing the scientific scope of the mission .
In short, though, the Mars 2020 rover — which is targeting a 2020 launch date — will look almost identical to Curiosity and will land on Mars in the same crazy-sky-crane way .
The Mars 2020 rover will look almost identical to Curiosity.
At a press conference at its headquarters in Washington DC, NASA announced the seven scientific instruments that “won” a place on the Mars 2020 rover, beating out 51 other proposals.
The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment  MOXIE  will produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, which is predominantly carbon dioxide  CO2 .
If MOXIE can produce oxygen on Mars, that oxygen could then be used as fuel to get a spacecraft back to Earth — a much, much cheaper and safer option than trying to land a spacecraft that’s still loaded with enough fuel for the return journey.
The Radar Imager for Mars’ Subsurface Exploration  RIMFAX  is a ground-penetrating radar that can provide centimeter-scale imaging of the  hopefully  interesting geological features below the Martian surface, such as groundwater… or massive microbial colonies.
Other notable features of the Mars 2020 rover include: a new drill that can dig deeper  where microbes could still be living today , a UV laser spectrometer  amusingly called SHERLOC , and a very-high-res SuperCam.
Finally, the Mars 2020 rover will also have the ability to store up to 30 Martian rock and soil samples that could eventually be returned to Earth for analysis.
There’s no word on how these samples will get back to Earth, but presumably it would involve a manned mission to Mars  NASA has indicated that it would like to put humans on Mars by 2035  .
While Mars 2020 will have some capabilities that allow it to look for signs of life, our tools here on Earth are much better suited to the task.
All told, the Mars 2020 rover is a very exciting prospect indeed.
In the shorter term, Mars 2020 could tell us definitively if life has ever lived on Mars — and potentially, whether life is still living below the Martian surface.
Can YOU build and send a semi-autonomous rover the size of an SUV to Mars with a budget of only $2.
Billion is the amount which the actual Mars Science Laboratory project cost over the course of 7 years  2004 – 2011 , and that number doesn’t even include the cost of continued communications with the rover as it fulfills missions on Mars.
Do they have in program to build some sort of highway on mars for all those rovers out there?
A great educational resource that we are not alone in the universe, that both our moon and mars had been populated, and our origins are from another planet.
This article is about hypothetical or fictional inhabitants of the planet Mars.
A Martian is a native inhabitant of the planet Mars .
Although the search for evidence of life on Mars continues, many science fiction writers have imagined what extraterrestrial life on Mars might be like.
Some writers also use the word Martian to describe a human colonist on Mars .
It appeared nearly simultaneously in England and the United States, in magazine articles detailing Asaph Hall s discovery of the moons of mars in August of that year.
The usage is incidental; it occurs when Aleriel, the novel s protagonist, lands on Mars in a spacecraft called an  ether-car   an allusion to aether , which was once postulated as a gaseous medium in outer space  .
In this story, the Martians are a technologically-advanced race of cephalopod -like extraterrestrials who invade Earth because Mars is becoming too cold to sustain them.
In his book Mars and Its Canals  1906 , astronomer and businessman Percival Lowell conjectured that an extinct Martian race had once constructed a vast network of aqueducts to channel water to their settlements from Mars  polar ice caps , Planum Australe and Planum Boreum .
The belief that Mars had canals was based on observations Giovanni Schiaparelli made through his reflecting telescope .
This idea inspired Lowell, who returned to the subject in Mars As the Abode of Life  1910 , wherein he wrote a fanciful description of what this Martian society may have been like.
One of the people Lowell inspired was Edgar Rice Burroughs , who began writing his own story about Mars in the summer of 1911.
The story is a planetary romance in which an American Civil War veteran named John Carter is transported to Mars when he walks inside a cave on Earth.
He finds that Mars is populated by two species of warring humanoids , and he becomes embroiled in their conflict.
In February 1912, an American pulp magazine called The All-Story published Burroughs  story as the first installment of a serial novel , which the editor titled Under the Moons of Mars  retitled A Princess of Mars in subsequent editions .
Although the noun Martian can describe any organism from Mars, these and later works typically imagine Martians as a humanoid monoculture.
Few writers describe a biodiverse Mars.
In science fiction, Martians are stereotypically imagined in one or more of the following ways: As alien invaders ; as humanoids with a civilization that resembles one on Earth; as anthropomorphic animals; as beings with superhuman abilities; as humanoids with a lower intelligence than humans; as human colonists who adopt a Martian identity; and or as an extinct race who possessed high intelligence.
They invade Earth because Mars is dying, and they need a warmer planet to live on.
His clothing is patterned on that of Mars , the god of war in Roman mythology .
In the Superman story  Black Magic on Mars   1950 ,  Superman faces Martians led by a dictator called Martler, who is an admirer of Adolf Hitler .
In William Cameron Menzies Invaders from Mars  1953 , remade by Tobe Hooper in 1986, fuses the tentacles of Wells  Martians to the idea little green men in the form of a Martian Mastermind; it uses tall, green mutant humanoid servant-slaves to do its bidding.
In Mars Attacks!
In Mars Needs Moms  2007 , a picture book by Berkeley Breathed , Martians are squat, humanoid beings with antennae and skin color that varies by individual.
Writer-director Simon Wells and his wife Wendy adapted the picture book into the film Mars Needs Moms  2011 .
In April 1911, about a year before The All-Story published the first installment of Burroughs  Under the Moons of Mars, Modern Electrics began publishing Hugo Gernsback  s own romance, Ralph 124C 41+ , which takes place on Earth.
Aelita, or The Decline of Mars , a novel that is equally science fiction and political fiction .
Its author, Soviet Russian writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy , tells a story of a Soviet engineer who builds a rocket and invites an acquaintance to accompany him in it to Mars.
All the while, Mars is entering a phase of climate change that threatens disaster for the population.
Balderston and John Hoare, also deals with radical environmental change on Mars, except in this case it occurs through terraforming .
Balderston was one of the few playwrights of the 20th century to adopt Mars or Martians as a subject for the stage.
Harry Horner directed the film, called Red Planet Mars , and it was released to cinemas in 1952.
In the film, a scientist communicates with Martians by radio, and they tell him that Mars is a utopia.
The Martians are almost completely wiped out by the diseases brought to Mars by human invaders.
At the end of the book, the human inhabitants of Mars realize that they are the new Martians.
Brothers Jim Thomas and John Thomas teamed with Graham Yost to write Mission to Mars  2000 , a film that depicts Martians as tall, feminine, peaceful humanoids who left Mars to escape the havoc caused by a massive meteorite impact.
Lewis wrote, in Out of the Silent Planet  1938 , about three humans who visit Mars and meet three different kinds of intelligent native creatures: The hrossa, the sorns séroni, and the pfifltriggi.
As Mars  climate becomes less favorable to sustaining them, the Ice Warriors seek a new planet.

The conflict begins when Captain Black , a human officer investigating radio signals from Mars, mistakes a surveillance camera for a weapon.
Alfred Russel Wallace refuted Lowell s conjecture in his own book Is Mars Habitable?
Apollo     astronauts, had photographed the wreckages and bodies of crashed     alien flying discs in a secret Texas Air Force hanger, and had a     seen an unidentified spacecraft in flight while with astronauts.
That transmission appeared to     be a mysterious clearly spoken ALIEN LANGUAGE.
Did they fear a possible alien invasion from that base and     panic and fear the public would panic?
So they live in underground cities in the United     States, Soviet Union, Moon, Mars and certain asteroids off Jupiter.
SPACE PROGRAM is a public     front and proof it is a public “disinformation agency”, and we have     files of false contradictory statements it has made about the     atmospheres of Venus, Mars, the Moon, etc.
Alternative 3 was to develop a top     secret insiders space program with Majority  MJ-12  as a secret     interplanetary state department in the Pentagon, and secretly build     underground spaceports to live in on Mars and the Moon and surface     domed manufacturing, mining, communications, and other centers.
The footage of the American spacecraft     landing on Mars BEFORE Apollo landed on the Moon leaked out in major     public British TV for one evening, thanks to a smuggling scientist,     before it was Censored and never made it to America.
I     occasionally think that how quickly our differences world-wide would     vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.
We are from what you     know as the planet Mars.
They     said that they were studying the organic materials on Earth because     of the rocky structure of Mars, and that they did not fly near our     cities because they avoided the air pollution.
The most famous astronomers of the early twentieth century,     including the great Percival Lovell, stated there were signs of     intelligent life on Mars.
They reported huge areas of green     vegetation that expanded and contracted with the melting of the ice     caps and the 4 seasons on Mars.
The man credited with inventing the radio, Marconi, published data     that he believed he had received intelligent radio signals from     Mars.
A series of dots and dashes, in Morse     code was revealed on a machine, reportedly originating from the     direction of Mars, and drawing a human face on a piece of receiving     paper in dots and dashes!
In 1976 the famous Viking probe was sent to Mars by NASA, and out of over 2,000 photos     reportedly taken of that planet, only a small fraction were shown to     the public.
We have studied other     Mars photos showing what appears to be an ancient ruined city,     roads, rectangular buildings, and walls.
The proof that the NASA space program covers up the truth about Mars is all tile serious contradictions in their public data.
Then how could their 50 foot parachute on the rocket     they landed on Mars even slow it down?
It would take 200     mile-per-hour winds on a planet with air said to be so thin that no     winds over 40 miles-per-hour had ever been recorded, and the warm     rising air to cause those winds did not even exist on that part of     Mars  according to other NASA data .
How can NASA land a probe on Mars that shoots out a flame that burns     the soil below it at thousands of degrees with deadly chemicals,     then a shovel scoops up that SAME fried poisoned soil and reports     “there is no life in it.
NASA data, to a meteorologist,     problematically proves Mars is much warmer than official reports     stated.
Water-based clouds like on Earth have been     photographed about 15,000 feet over Mars, and such clouds and fog     cannot exist in an atmospheric pressure of only 7.
Evidence indicates that 32 degrees above zero must exist up to at     least 15,000 feet on Mars, which is higher than Haleakala Crater in     Hawaii.
Minus     122 degree temperatures can exist in certain parts of Mars, just     like minus127 degrees has been recorded on Earth.
The Pentagon has been secretly trading livestock, minerals, and a labor force to     these Zetans on Mars, for a couple of decades at least, for     technology that was developed into the Star Wars defense system,     lasers, superior metals, computers, medical advancements, etc.
However, there is also a spiritual civilization on Mars that is so     far advanced that the other civilizations cannot interfere with it.
This civilization is on a higher     4th dimensional frequency than the other 3D nations on Mars.
The sand dunes on Mars photographed by     the Orbiter have the SAME height and dune to dune spacing as sand     dunes on Earth in Colorado.
NASA stated the North Pole on     Mars is now going through its summer, so the ice cap is about as     small as it ever gets.
Martin, who was with Pasadena Viking Control, said the biology     instrument on Mars have received positive signs of life in spite of     the amazing fact it was at such a blow-torched landing site!
If we would have     placed our Viking landers in our Pasadena parking lot and received     the SAME chemical and biological readings were, received from Mars,     WE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT A DEFINITE  SIGN OF LIFE”.
Scientists     admit that if all the water trapped below the surface of Mars was     released to the surface, it would form an ocean a mile deep covering the entire planet!
An international AP release stated that photos of Mars’ northern     regions reveal mysterious patterns, resembling contour PLOWING on     the planet’s red surface.
The report added that the mammals on Mars are rodents with thick     white fur, comparable to large hares, that feed on roots, larvae,     and the eggs of big lizards that live among the low rocks of the     canyon walls.
About 12,000 years ago life-sustaining     conditions on Mars deteriorated to the point where it became urgent     to evacuate most of the inhabitants, who migrated to Earth and     landed high in the mountains of Tibet, where the air is thin with     little oxygen like it is on Mars.
However, many of the residents     of Mars flew to the Moon and Earth  where many primitive ancients     mistook them for gods .
There are also different races living on     Mars.
One race active on Mars is     reportedly from Zeta Reticuli, a small humanoid grey race with large     heads, long slender arms, and no lungs  they do not need an     atmosphere to breath , and no digestive system as we know the Zetans are biologically somewhat like insects, with thick tough skin     adaptable withstanding a harsher atmosphere like on the surface of Mars.
The Sirian Interplanetary Empire reportedly claimed Mars before it     claimed Earth in Atlantean times, and the ancients called the Sirian     constellation the Phoenix Constellation.
The Sirians evacuated Mars when its atmosphere and surface was     devastated by nuclear war and a comet, while the Alcyone Pleiadeans evacuated Venus in the same conflicts Venus Whov.
Such a cataclysm would destroy the     Orion colony on the Moon  Luna  and the Sirian colony today on Mars.
I have     been in close association with Richard Hoagland and his Mars     Mission.
Hoagland is the famous scientists who wrote the Monuments of Mars and publicly exposed the Face, pyramids, and other Martian and Lunar     ruins on CNN, major newspapers, and national and international     magazines.
Later I became affiliated with his Mars Mission to     expose this huge news.
This is a mostly     TRUE MOVIE about secret Pentagon  Soviet  Illuminati activities on     Mars.
More  evidence of life  as online users claim to spot an alien picking up a Dr Martens boot in Curiosity s latest images  or is this just another trick of the light played on us by Mars?
When you first see Alien Disclosure UK s  evidence  of life on the Red Planet, all you can see is a mass of rocks.
But as we became better with our optics, so did our understanding of Mars, and this belief was put to bed as newer images showed no trace of life.
Then, in 1976, Mars was back with a new mystery - the famous Face on Mars, taken by the Viking 1 during a flyby in 1976.
This was later shown to be just another light and perspective trick by Mars, but the haunting visage captured the world s attention.
More recently, YouTube user StephenHannardADGUK, part of Alien Disclosure UK, has been gazing at the latest images from the Curiosity Rover, and has collected a fine collection of oddities.
He announced:  Mars Curiosity captures a  possible ancient finger, a dome shaped object, a shoe or sandal and a  possible Martian creature.
Two lights are seen on Mars.
VIDEO: Is this an alien on Mars?
In mythology,  Mars is the Roman god of War, a name possibly inspired by the planet s red   blood  colour.
Because of its colour, Mars is sometimes known as the Red  Planet.
The length of a day on Mars is not much longer than a  day on Earth .
It takes 24 hours and 37 minutes for Mars to spin once on its  axis, compared to 23 hours and 56 minutes for Earth to do the same.
To complete a full journey around the Sun , Mars takes  687 days.
They orbit Mars quite closely and travel around the planet quickly.
Phobos is 9,377 kilometres  5,827 miles  away from Mars and orbits it every 7  hours, 39 minutes.
This is what gives Mars its red  colour.
Another feature of Mars  surface is Valles  Marineris, a 4,000 kilometres  2485 miles  long canyon which stretches almost a  quarter of the way around the planet.
Scientists believe that water was once abundant on the  surface of Mars and quite possibly plentiful enough to form oceans similar to  those on Earth .
Nowadays, Mars is a dry planet with only small signs of the  present existence of water.
Nobody knows for  certain, but scientists certainly aim to find out through missions to Mars .
For  almost half a century, a number of space craft have visited Mars.
Even now, there is a rover on Mars travelling very slowly across its surface and making discoveries.
The main reason for visiting Mars, apart from the fact  that it is fairly easy to get to, is that there is a small chance that the  planet could have supported life at some point in its long history.
So far, all missions to Mars have been unmanned,  and all discoveries have been made by robots.
However, at some point in the  not-too-distant future  hopefully , people will travel to Mars.
This scanning electron microscope image shows speroidal features embedded in a layer of iddingsite, a mineral formed by action of water, in a meteorite that came from Mars.
A meteorite from Mars has been studied up-close and scientists have detected tiny structures that could be interpreted as having a biological origin.
The meteorite sample contains strong evidence that Mars used to be a lot wetter than it is now, but the researchers also report on the discovery of evidence for â€œbiological processesâ€� that occurred on the Red Planet hundreds of millions of years ago.
The team, led by David McKay of Johnson Space Center, identified â€œbiogenic structuresâ€� inside the meteorite that was theorized to be formed by indigenous life on Mars.
Analysis of the meteorite shows that it formed on the surface of Mars 1.
These chunks of Mars rock then traveled through interplanetary space until one of the samples, Y000593, encountered Earth and fell to the surface as a meteorite, falling on Antarctica some 50,000 years ago.
There are many known samples of Mars crust that have fallen to Earth as meteorites and are considered incredibly valuable scientific specimens that can be used as time capsules into Marsâ€™ geologic past.
While robotic missions to Mars continue to shed light on the planetâ€™s history, the only samples from Mars available for study on Earth are Martian meteorites,â€� said lead author Lauren White, of NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a news release.
On Earth, we can utilize multiple analytical techniques to take a more in-depth look into meteorites and shed light on the history of Mars.
As more Martian meteorites are discovered, continued research focusing on these samples collectively will offer deeper insight into attributes which are indigenous to ancient Mars.
Furthermore, as these meteorite studies are compared to present day robotic observations on Mars, the mysteries of the planetâ€™s seemingly wetter past will be revealed.
This scanning electron microscope image of a polished thin section of a meteorite from Mars shows tunnels and curved microtunnels.
This basically means that this Mars meteorite contains microscopic features that resemble mineral formations created by bacteria on Earth.
Is this proof of Martian bacteria munching through Mars rock?
Since the 1996 ALH84001 controversy, many other researchers have come forward with meteorite studies that appear to show evidence for life on Mars and other interplanetary locations, but most have been published in sketchy journals with little to no peer review process , which serves to blur valuable research being carried out by astrobiologists.
Therefore, skepticism for any Mars life study is often high.
So, until we can detect and analyze DNA of extraterrestrial origin or have the ability to return pristine samples from Mars, work like this will be filed under â€œfascinating but not conclusiveâ€� in the profound hunt for life beyond Earth.
Rhawn Joseph is suing the space agency after it released photos last week showing a rock on Mars in a place where it hadn t been just 12 days before.
Joseph claims NASA is failing to investigate alien life and wants the rover to go back and snap more photos of the mysterious rock.
A self-described scientist says it could be alien life.
A self-described scientist has filed a lawsuit alleging NASA is failing to properly investigate alien life.
Rhawn Joseph, who s written several books on extraterrestrial activity, wants the space agency to further analyze a strange rock on Mars, which he believes is proof of Martian activity.

LONDON: More than two years into the Curiosity rover s lonely trek across Mars, conspiracy theorists believe they have struck gold: an  alien thigh bone  has been spotted on the surface of the red planet.
For keen alien hunters, the image below — taken by the rover s  MastCam on August 14 — is proof that large animals once roamed Mars, possibly even dinosaurs.
Simply put this shows that there were some living things on the Mars  sic ,  asserts an anonymous editorial writer at Northern Voices Online, while the popular site UFO Blogger compares the find to previous images of a  fossilized, reptilian spine  and a  human finger .
The regularity of these  finds  is of course testament not to the once-flourishing wildlife of Mars, but to the human brain s remarkable capacity to spot patterns in random noise.
Of course, there is some truth to conspiracy theorists  hopes of life on Mars, with scientists pointing out last year that the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs could have flung rocks carrying organic matter to the red planet some 66 million years ago.
Seen by  Mars rover Curiosity using its MastCam, this Mars rock may look like a femur thigh bone.
Unfortunately, at this point  and for roughly 3 billion years prior  Mars was a barren place with no flowing water.
Is this photo an alien or dinosaur thigh bone on Mars, as some conspiracy theorists have suggested?

If life ever existed on Mars, scientists expect that it would be small simple life forms called microbes.
So I m not surprised that people see a  man in the moon  and a  thigh bone  on Mars.
He added that he would be  extremely surprised  if the object seen in the photo was anything other than what scientists already expected to see on Mars.
So far there had been no evidence that life had ever existed on Mars.
If there was evidence of  on Mars it would have been front-page news way before any of this conspiratorial stuff came up,  Mr Vlahos said.
For example] there was a meteorite that was found in Antarctica some 10 years ago and we thought that we had found evidence of bacteria in it coming from Mars and later on it was decided that that wasn t the case.
Although there have been findings that would suggest there was water on Mars , which is now likely to be in ice form, Mr Vlahos said this would not be enough alone to support life on the planet.
The Curiosity rover has been on Mars for just over two years now, producing many images that have intrigued scientists and conspiracy theorists.
It was later explained as a piece of a larger rock that had been broken and moved by the Mars rover Opportunity s wheel in early January.
Not only was there life on Mars, it was Australian  and with good taste in beer, none of your Martian VB!
On Thursday, media outlets across the English-speaking world creamed their collective space-jeans over a possible  alien thigh bone  recently photographed by the Mars rover Curiosity.

Yesterday, NASA issued a press release stating the vaguely bone-shaped rock  is likely sculpted by erosion, either wind or water,  noting that Mars  likely never had enough oxygen  to support complex life.

Curiosity landed on Mars Aug.
The other Mars rover, Opportunity, landed Jan.

Since Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012, there have been several rumors that evidence has been found of Martian life in the forms of fossils, statues and even a carved alien skull and that NASA has  covered up  the existence of alien life on the planet.
Adding the list this week, NASA has denied claims that a flash of light in a photo taken by Curiosity, is proof that the rover has found alien life as rumored on many UFO websites.
The  alien life  speculation empasized that there appears there is a square part at the base of the light, which seems inconsistent with any kind of natural explanation.
But NASA imaging scientist Justin Maki, who works at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ss head of the team looking after Curiosity’s engineering cameras, has denied the alien life rumors pointing out that the light appears only in the photo taken with the camera on the probe’s right-hand side suggesting that it s sunlight reflecting off a particular rock, or light that has found its way through the camera’s housing due to damage of some sort.
A fact certain to inspire further rumors of NASA cover up among the  Alien Life  proponents.
That s essentially because landing complex computer driven rovers on an alien planet is a lot harder than most of us would suspect.
Furthermore: re-diverting and reprogramming the driving path of a rover on an alien planet, every time some anonymous dude on the Internet  possibly sitting in his Mom s basement, wearing nothing but underwear  happens to perceive a face, or bigfoot monster, or glint reflection of sun light on the lens.
A rock reflection is also not a good explanation, because rocks are dull, non-reflective objects, and it is particularly unlikely that you would have such a powerful light reflection on Mars  where the sun looks smaller in the sky .
It is always good to be analytic and watchful especially of government affiliated entities  well NASA is a gov funded organization, not exactly a gov entity but close but if intelligent life is to exist on Mars it s gonna have to breathe in very rare partial vacuum atmosphere, and breathe CO2 and sustain extremes in temperatures colder than Antartica, wading in frozen CO2 water slush and living in a drier than dry desert.
Yes, there most certainly has to be life and advance intelligent life in our Galaxy and a lot of it, granted, so it would not be surprising in the least of it was found visiting our own Solar system and Earth, but skulls on Mars and such can be tossed off as tabloid hype if you look at Mars  history as a failed too cold, too dry, too small not enough magnetic field radioactive as Hades planet.
It s good to study Mars in detail but I think it is way too expensive and risky to ever have a manned mission when a small fraction of the money spent could yield so much more info using robotics and no risk to human life.
Last week, NASA announced that the Mars rover Opportunity had stumbled upon a mysterious rock that seemed to appear out of nowhere .
Instead, according to the lawsuit, the object is actually an alien organism that was there the entire time, but grew over the course of those twelve Martian sols to its present size.
As most of the focus on Mars missions is to determine past habitability, it seems very unlikely that what would have been one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time would so easily be written off as a stray rock that just so happens to have some unusual characteristics.
In fact, the only spot where the alien can move is at the joint where the torso connects to the legs.
There is a hole in the Alien s chest that makes it capable of holding any LEGO object that fits inside, such as its jetpack .
It is stated that they are not from Mars, but came there to conquer it and mine out its Energy Crystals .
They possibly could have crashed there, as seen in LEGO Battles  though that could have been a separate ship and they simply invaded Mars .
They positioned themselves in the hive they built and are lead by Alien Commander , who is ultimately lead by the Alien Queen .
Some of them wear jet packs  called Vipers  to move around the surface of Mars more swiftly.
In the end, however, they were driven off of Mars.
It is possible that they were driven into extinction or went into hiding or Mars Mission could be set in an alternative universe from Life on Mars .

There have been reports of alien bases right here on earth, and under the oceans, so why wouldn t there also be such alien made structures elsewhere in the solar system?
Why is there a marine who claims to have spent over ten years on a secret base on Mars?
The notion of alien moon bases is in resurgence recently with such movies as Apollo 18 & Iron Sky, as well as a recent SyFy channel production,  Aliens on the Moon   full video below  which relied heavily on the books, ULO s Unidentified Lunar Objects revealed in NASA photography by Alan Sturm and Somebody else is on the Moon by George Leonard.
Some sources even claim the astronauts made contact with an alien race on the moon.
As the story goes, the crew of Apollo 20 explored the alien craft, and also discovered a large city, and of all things a preserved alien girl.
As with most fantastic tales, this one bears the hybrid marks of having some truth, and some sensationalism as well, regards the alien mummy girl; and it would not be the first time the powers that be tried to diffuse the truth with just the right amount of not-so-true.
So, NASA turned it s attention and efforts towards the mysterious red planet Mars, since they had plans to travel there as well, and right away there were signs that others had gotten there first.
Over the years the debate just wouldn t go away, the public clamored for more photos from Cydonia but they never came, until 2001 when the Mars Global Surveyor satellite again photographed the face on Mars .
Perhaps the foremost authority on all things Mars is former NASA employee Richard Hoagland, and there is a wealth of information on his website: Enterprise mission.
We have mystified and marveled over Mars for a long time, being the nearest inhabitable world in the solar system we wonder in awe and perhaps just a little dread if there be life there.
Just like the moon; NASA has similar long range plans for Mars, including a colony eventually, and yet once again there are disturbing indications that someone else is already there.
Of all Mars missions attempted by various countries over the years, 23 have disappeared or failed upon reaching the orbit of Mars!
The 1989 Russian Mars probe Phobos-2 seemed to come under direct attack by a UFO which either rammed it or shot it down.
Then there is the photo some say is the fossilized body of an ET on Mars.
Thinking about ET s and alien bases in our solar system may be uncomfortable for some, so they write it off as nutters exercising their free speech.

Tithonia City provides us will evidence of alien structures on the Red Planet.
WE ARE NOT ALONE, AND SOMEONE EITHER IS, OR HAS BEEN ON MARS.
A NASA picture of a mysterious bright light on Mars has sparked the interest of UFO believers.
Maki explained that the bright spots appear in single images taken by the Navigation Camera on NASA s Curiosity Mars rover s right-eye but not its left.
The rover science team is also looking at the possibility that the bright spots could be sunlight reaching the camera s CCD directly through a vent hole in the camera housing, which has happened previously on other cameras on Curiosity and other Mars rovers when the geometry of the incoming sunlight relative to the camera is precisely aligned.
The picture was captured on April 3 by the right-hand navigation camera on NASA s Mars Curiosity rover.

Remember that face that was seen on Mars?
Most people seem so preoccupied with Mars that everyone forgets there are other planets and moons we need to search.
Mars is dead – although there may be alien bases under its surface, there is very little for us to see there,  he writes in a blog post .
In 1976, photos taken from the Viking 1 spaceship revealed what looked like a face on Mars .
Despite Nasa proving in 2001 that the face was actually just a landform, Nasa has still been sued for not investigating alien life  on Mars.
Similar to Mars, Waring has seen a multitude of ancient-looking faces on Mercury, as well as on other planets, but he is much less confident about what the faces mean, compared to the structures.
Conspiracy theorists have identified what they claim to be a  skull  on the surface of Mars.
Something that is real evidence that this could be an ancient skull is the ridge behind the eye socket,  posits UFO Sightings Daily , our favourite repository of just-about readable alien fervour.
Curious about images like this, which appear to show either camouflaged or fossilized lizards running around on Mars.
NASA s Mars rover Curiosity shot a photo of this little guy earlier this year.
The conspiracies go back to July 25, 1976, when this shot of the  Face on Mars  was taken by an orbiter.
These are real photos taken of Mars  surface.

NASA’s Curiosity rover recently rolled to a new vantage point on  Mars Mars and started snapping photos to send home, and one shot seems to show that some underground-dwelling martians may have left the porch light on.
Of course, the more conspiracy minded among us dismiss this explanation as part of a cover-up involving the discovery of alien life, or maybe lizard people or something.
The source for the dispersion of angelic  alien  technology, and the Hermetic knowledge that influenced human civilization since the days of Noah, was Sidonia   Cydonia.

Conspiracy theorists have suggested a photo captured by Nasa’s Mars Curiosity rover could indicate an alien presence on the surface.
Is the light in the distance alien life?
Photographs taken by NASA s 1976 Viking space probe show what appears to be a humanoid face in the Cydonia region of the planet Mars.
In fact, I was present during one of his presentations when some scientists from JPL walked up and handed him high-resolution photos of Mars, showing clearly that intelligent life forms had built structures there.
Referring to the fact that Hoagland had already identified many other  built  structures on Mars and the moon.

His first book  Secret Mars: The Alien Connection  was published in 2013.
Evidence of an advanced civilization that inhabited our solar system in the past seems to be strewn all over Mars and the Moon.
This is a absolute must read for anyone interested in the “anomalies” on the surface of Mars.
Since I’m not a scientist with reputation and funding to protect, I can put together all the books I’ve read and pictures I’ve seen and come to this conclusion:  THERE ARE RUINS OF A TECHNOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION ON MARS, AS WELL AS THE MOON AND OTHER PARTS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM!
The world won’t end if you release everything you are hiding about extraterrestrials, UFOs, ruins on Mars, etc.
SO PLEASE STOP HIDING THE INFORMATION AND RELEASE THIS DATA AND SEND PROBES  preferably manned  TO MARS, THE MOON, ETC.
Craig is careful, but I believe that he presents a good case for the possible existence of an ancient, lost civilization of Mars or that of ancient alien bases on Mars.
Photographic evidence of the Moon, Mars, and other locations seem to indicate that the controversial statements put out by certain brave individuals holds true.
Mounted to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it floats high above the red planet is the HiRISE telescope, an imaging device capable of taking incredibly high-resolution photos of the martian landscape.
It s sent back nearly 30,000 photos during its time above the planet, which have been used by NASA to find clear landing spots for rovers, and by researchers to learn more about the features of Mars  surface.
The stunning views captured by HiRISE have inspired a book from the publisher Aperture, called This is Mars , which includes 150 of its finest looks at the planet.
False color images are still useful, however, in helping researchers distinguish between different elements of Mars  landscape.
Later missions  especially Mariner 9 in 1971, Vikings 1 and 2 in 1976, Mars Global Surveyor since 1997 and Mars Pathfinder in 1997  have shown a dead planet without liquid water, suffering freezing temperatures and swept by violent winds.
This has led some researchers to suggest that not only life, but also an advanced civilisation may once have existed on Mars.
The part of Mars that has attracted most attention since satellite exploration of the planet began is the Cydonia Mensae region, located in the planet’s northern hemisphere.
The region bears traces of former shorelines – it is now accepted by most astronomers that Mars was once home to large bodies of water – and of eroded hills and mountains, corresponding to terrestrial buttes and mesas.
The original view of astronomers was that the northern past of Mars had originally been covered with a sediment that subsequently eroded, perhaps as a result of wind action.
Demands for photographs of higher quality than those of 1976 – with their resolutions of no better than 43 m per pixel – grew during the 1990s, especially when NASA announced the forthcoming launch of Mars Observer on 22 September 1992.
Indeed, the less expensive means is what the conspiracy theorists suggested about the results of the next probe, the Mars Global Surveyor: they declared the first photograph of the ‘Face’ obtained by the Mars Orbital Camera  Frame SPO-1-220 03  on 5 April 1998 to be fake.
A second photograph from the Mars Orbital Camera, taken on 3 June 2000 and released on 31 January 2001, shows only a small part of the ‘Face’, but it confirms the 1998 photograph in every respect.
To explain the lack of resemblance to the original view of the ‘Face’ as a highly structured and artificial carving, they now have to accept either that it has suffered a great deal of erosion from its pristine form or that NASA has tampered with the photograph taken by the Mars Orbital Camera, as it was the identification of the pristine form that led to the claims for artificiality being made in the first place.
Faces are one of the first patterns the infant human learns to recognise, so it is unsurprising that a face-like mesa on Mars should be ‘read ; by so many as an actual representation of a human  or closely humanoid  face.
Moreover, the same Mars Orbital Camera frame that rephotographed the ‘Face’ in 1998 also clipped the north-western corner of the ‘D&M Pyramid’.
Moreover, the Mars Orbital Camera reveals a mountain very similar to the ‘D&M Pyramid’.
The Mars Orbital Camera rephotographed the ‘fort’ on three separate occasions, with it each time appearing as a low hill with erosion features that include apparently recent landslips.
Claims for artificiality have been made for several other sites on Mars, mostly in the Cydonia Mensae region.
Whereas the 1976 Viking Orbiter photographs give it a smooth and near-circular appearance, the Mars Orbital Camera photograph frame m03 00766, taken on 4 July 1999 with a resolution of 3.
Claims of this nature are not being made for the Mars Orbital Camera images, except for a few much smaller features that nevertheless also appear to be of geological origin.
Claims have also been made for the existence of pyramids in Elysium Regio, but they suffer from exactly the same problems as the pyramids of Cydonia Mensae: poor resolution on the Viking Orbiter images and Mars Orbital Camera images that does not support the artificiality hypothesis.
On the other hand, the Mars Orbital Camera is revealing all manner of curious and unexpected formations.
The Mars Sojourner roving vehicle also showed much the same sort of surface as the Viking landers had more than twenty years previously, but in greater detail and with the advantage of multiple perspectives.
Responses to Alien archaeology on Mars?
I wish I could go to Mars!
Now, if colour shifting occurred in Mars images, it might be for more reasons other than attempting to fabricate the appearance of Mars.
Also,there’s plenty of rocks on Mars.
If alien civilizations exist  I’m neutral towards the exo-planet “another earth” hype in the press , then they had histories.
Some may have died out and others gone past the stage of monumental buildings, but alien archeology exists.
If Mars was once inhabitable and warm with hydrogen as the greenhouse gas, then for how long?
I don’t argue this to imply UFO aliens, it’s likely that any intelligence died out both on Mars and on Venus because Mars could not keep it’s atmosphere and Venus experienced a hellish global warming due to the sun’s increasing energy output.
The Case of The Jelly Doughnut-Rock On Mars has yet to be cracked, and in an extreme development yesterday, one alien enthusiast is even suing NASA for failing to pursue the extraterrestrial origins of Pinnacle Island.
Clearly, obviously, the “mystery” structure reported by the Mars Rover team was already there in miniature  3528  before the larger structure was photographed 12 Martian days later  3540 .
Joseph fancies himself an unrecognized space martyr in the search for alien life, having “done what these two arrogant, incompetent, negligent fools should have done.
In the e-mail he sent us, he even gave us the contact information for our man Space Detective Steve Squyres, so that we too can condemn the NASA Investigator for just, you know, letting the ball drop and forgetting to pursue that whole alien thing.
Okay, alien enthusiasts, you win.
I’m going to go do some “scientific research” of my own and look at past images taken by rovers until I finally see that colony of unicorns I always expected was on Mars.
ALMOST everywhere you go on Earth, you encounter alien species that were introduced – often inadvertently – by humans.
Now it seems possible that we have done the same to Mars.
If Mars has its own life, it should be different enough from Earth life for us to recognise it.
In either case, Earth life will struggle to colonise Mars.
While governments of most spacefaring nations have agreed to abide by the rules, the law is unclear on private companies such as SpaceX and Mars One, who are hoping to beat national agencies to Mars.
Mars One has declared that it will play by the rules if it ever succeeds in starting the first human colony on Mars.
This article appeared in print under the headline  Is there Earth life on Mars?

If we send, say, 20 humans to set up a colony on Mars , we’ll have to either ship literally tons of food along with them or come up with some incredibly efficient on-ship farms and gardens.
There is another option however, one that is often dismissed as impossible despite a near total lack of hard data on the subject: perhaps we could terraform Mars itself.
A pioneering researcher named Michael Mautner wants to assess just how feasible that idea really is, by trying to grow everything from yeast to potatoes in simulated alien soil.
Mautner is an “astro-ecologist,” an expert in alien biospheres, but since we haven’t actually found any alien biospheres just yet, Mautner and his very few international colleagues have historically worked only in predictions and inferences.
Those years of thinking have led Mautner to address one of the biggest problems with growing plants on Mars: Martian soil lacks virtually everything a plant would need to grow.
All his alien farming is of course done on Earth with our oxygen-rich atmosphere and 62% higher force of gravity, so the results are anything but definitive, but “anaerobic”  oxygen-free  growth is not as unheard-of as you might think.
Getting regular, aerobic plants and microorganisms to grow is just the first step — future Martian settlers may very well end up eating virtually nothing but man-made species genetically tailored to survive on Mars.
When colonizing space, we could end up moving an asteroid into orbit around Earth, the Moon, or Mars for use as a satellite farm.
Alternatively, we might exploit a natural impact on Mars, moving in to take advantage of the newly deposited nutrients before time steals them away.
It’s possible we could build a cliche “biodome” over these areas to let life create a stable atmosphere, but just as possible we could use species tailored to the natural environment of Mars.
This experiment at Utah’s Mars Desert Research Station looks at the effects of temperature and atmosphere on plant growth.
Mautner has managed to successfully grow both asparagus and potato samples in his alien soil simulate, and the microbes have done even better.
This would also reduce the risk of our contaminating Mars with potentially destabilizing Earth microbes.
Astro-ecology provides an almost unlimited possibility space to explore, so Mautner isn’t satisfied just thinking about colonizing Mars.
Percival Lowell’s sketches of supposed canals on Mars.
Our man Lowell, you see, was quite convinced that an alien race occupied Mars , though he never directly commented on their potential as babysitters for human astronauts.
This saga begins in 1888, when Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli announced that he had observed what he called canali on Mars, drawing the sketch below.
Giovanni Schiaparelli’s sketch of canali on Mars.
So, along comes Lowell, who takes the idea of “canals” on Mars and gets … a bit carried away with it.
The incredibly gorgeous, decidedly canal-free surface of Mars.
At left is a smiling crater: Astronomers believe Mars to be among the happiest of planets.
He concludes, rather enigmatically and triumphantly: “That Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort or other we may consider as certain as it is uncertain what those beings may be.
Subsequent mapping of the surface of Mars of course found no such canals, and thankfully none of NASA’s rovers have yet tumbled into the greatest public works project the solar system has  n ever known.
We now know, though, that water likely flowed freely on Mars long ago, but today is almost exclusively locked in the polar caps, with liquid water perhaps flowing from time to time .
Scientist Rhawn Joseph has filed a lawsuit over what he alleges to be a conspiracy involving NASA, Mars and a mysterious rock.
Joseph claims the space agency refused to investigate what he deemed to be alien life on Mars, calling the conclusions reached by NASA as “little more than magical thinking.
Joseph, working as an astrobiologist, claims NASA has failed to investigate evidence of life on Mars.
The Mars rover first photographed the outcrop on Sol 3528 and again 12 days later, Sol 3540.
Steve Squyres, lead scientist for the NASA Mars Exploration Rover mission, said at the time, “It just plain appeared at that spot and we haven’t driven over that spot.
While life on Mars would be a significant discovery, Joseph says NASA has refused to actually investigate the rock with all photographic evidence taken by Opportunity being of “low resolution” and “slightly out of focus.
After comparing structural examples of apothecia, or “shield lichen,” with what was found on Mars, including the “paraphyses,” the “spore producing organs, he concludes the organism grew over the twelve days that Opportunity photographed the rock outcrop.
Despite this evidence, NASA has yet to acknowledge the Mars mystery rock is in fact evidence of life.
The journal previously hosted a dubious   proof of alien life   article last year and has a history of publishing research that has been deemed  Way, way, way ridiculously oh-holy-wow-how-could-anyone-publish-this wrong.
The public knows these revelations as Martian  meteorites with fossilized primitive life forms, water on Mars, and the Moon,  Titian maybe harboring life in its oceans, Mars anomalies, and, recently,  planets found around other stars.
What has never been discussed to any firm conclusion or even  headed in the right direction is an important key that could have answered the  question of life on Mars early on in our investigations of the planet.
The Soviets chose Venus to explore as being the home of the ETs, and  NASA aimed for Mars.
Strangely or not, their attempts to study Mars were  almost totally disastrous.
The Soviets had over thirty failed shots to Mars, one after  another.
Whatever the real reason, the Soviets were shut out on Mars despite  their successes to Venus.
On the other hand, almost all of NASA’s missions to  Mars were successes.
True, it was indeed an  alien environment as compared to Earth, but it was considered to be the last  possible planet in the solar system that had even a minute chance of supporting   or having supported  some aspect of life.
At Carl Sagan’s urging, who sincerely believed life existed on  Mars, mysterious Phobos was added to the Mariner 9 flight program.
From then on  Phobos, itself, was high on the agenda for data acquisition in future Mars’ explorations although Mars itself remained the prime focus.
What the Orbiters revealed about Phobos can stand as the primary  reason NASA and JPL later gave up the prompt release of spacecraft images,  especially from the Mars’ probes and assigned the rights to a non-governmental  business, Malin and company.
It is incomprehensible that some scientist at the heart of the  Viking program—Sagan in particular—did not put the basic facts together and  understand how Mars, via the data of Phobos, even if with no other indicators  from the planet itself, was the home for the UFO ETs.
If Phobos did not circle Mars in its  present orbit as proof that it is there, many astrophysicists would not even  accept that possibility!
Yet, those  astrophysicists and exogeologists that claim Phobos was created in or near its  current position from leftover debris from the formation of Mars, have a  dilemma.
While sidestepping the “capture” theory entirely, they cannot offer a  viable argument why the two little satellites’ compositions and structures are  far different than Mars.
A leading disinformation agent was pretending a few months ago as  if the discrepancy between the dimensions of Phobos and its mass was a recent  discovery from the ESA mission to Mars earlier this year.
That would appear to  make sense in view of how strip mining is done on Earth: Phobos and Deimos were  brought to Mars for mining from the outer reaches of the asteroid belt where  their D-type cluster, normally resides.
And even if moved to Mars for an  entirely different purpose, such as an artistic, technological whim, it still  may have contained exotic resources worth mining.
Some of the  other field of grooves perpendicular to the longitudinal line of thrust for the  main “engines” are suggestive that it did undergo some side thrusting, perhaps  at the critical time of insertion into the Mars’ orbit.
It would also enable dramatically shorter trips times to Mars and other  nearer-term destinations.
AU from Mars.
The fall to the Mars’ area of rotation would be gravitationally  assisted by the Sun’s influence, a free tug by gravity toward the target, but  too much so.
The entire process from orbiting near Jupiter to orbiting Mars  may have consumed about a year.
To be sure, there would have been a precise  coordination to the efforts of position and velocity during the journey, but few  places in the transition would be as demanding as when the 16x13x11-mile body  was brought into the vicinity of Mars’ gravity.
At the end of the journey, the stresses of  maneuvering the body into a Mars’ orbit would have been a further test of its  durability.
In that  fashion, they prevented any problem of disposing of the material once in close  orbit around Mars.
The grooves present us with a full record of the motions, from  start to end, that the body went through as it was guided to Mars.
The sage of the moons of Mars could stop at this point, but it  cannot.
It was placed at a relatively safe distance of three Mars’ diameters  7767 miles  away from the surface.
Deimos probably and originally was set in a synchronize orbit  that has slipped over the eons as it slowly drifts away from Mars.
Phobos is  slowly sinking toward Mars and Deimos is moving away.
The bringing of Phobos to a Mars’ orbit was a dangerous  undertaking.
Given the condition of Mars today, perhaps Phobos was hauled in to  be nothing more than an in-kind monument to a virtually dead Mars caused by an  earlier attempt that went terribly wrong, fell to Mars and destroyed their  civilization and the planetary environment.
Regular readers to this site may have read in the past our articles on Phobos, which is one of the small moons that circle around Mars.
In July 1988, the Russians launched two unmanned satellite probes - Phobos 1 and Phobos 2 - in the direction of Mars, with the primary intention of investigating the planet s mysterious moon, Phobos.
Phobos 2 was also ultimately lost in the most intriguing circumstances, but not before it had beamed back certain images and information from the planet Mars itself.
Phobos 2 arrived safely at Mars in January 1989 and entered into an orbit around Mars as the first step at its destination towards its ultimate goal: to transfer to an orbit that would make it fly almost in tandem with the Martian moonlet called Phobos  hence the spacecrafts name  and explore the moonlet with highly sophisticated equipment that included two packages of instruments to be placed on the moonlet s surface.
An unusual photo of a thin shadow across mars was shown on the Russian television segment.
Seen on the surface of Mars was a clearly defined dark shape that could indeed be described, as it was in he initial dispatch from Moscow, as a  thin elipse   this photo is a still from the Soviet television clip .
Becklake described it as  something that is between the spacecraft and Mars, because we can see the Martian surface below it,  and stressed that the object was seen by both the optical and the infrared  heat seeking  camera.
In his careful words to  Aviation Week and Space Technology , the chairman of the Soviet equivalent of NASA, referred to the last frame, saying,  One image appears to include an odd-shaped object between the spacecraft and Mars.
Part of the information was what has been called  the first ever leaked accounts of an alien mother ship in the solar system .
The cigar shaped craft in the penultimate frame taken by Phobos 2 is apparently the object casting the oblong shadow on the surface of Mars in the earlier photo.
Cosmic Conspiracies were shocked to receive news that the Moons of Mars, Phobos and Diemos, have disappeared and that any pictures that are released by NASA of Phobos are years out of date.
We know from Malin Space Science Systems that the Mars Orbital Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor observed the shadow of Phobos on the surface of Mars on August 26, 1999, September 1, 1999, September 8, 1999, and September 25, 1999 and November 1, 1999.
With the recent global dust storm on Mars, and the increasing sightings of rare meteor events here on Earth, the sense of urgency for closure is being reinforced.
Looking at the history of NASA s busted theories and the virtual Mars imagery monopoly they’ve granted to  Malin Space Science Systems  MSSS , it becomes apparent why they have their heads in the sand – politics and funding.
As most readers will be aware, YOWUSA has been trying to solve the mystery surrounding the fate of comet 76P and its effects  if any  it had on the moons of Mars for some time now.
Therefore, our efforts have focused on obtaining either a good quality image of Phobos from a reliable source, or data indicating that 76P was indeed where it should have been after passing Mars.
The other, taken by Australian Steve Massey, is the best and only evidence to date that conclusively proves that Deimos was still orbiting Mars prior to the Mars Global Super Storm.
On June 27 2001, a violent dust storm exploded from the Hellas Basin region of Mars.
Such an event has not been seen since the Mariner 9 spacecraft arrived at Mars in 1971, and this super storm only lasted for one month.
The MSSS images show a very red, dusty and warmer Mars that has resulted from this storm.
The storm actually started after the last known picture of Phobos was taken, and could perhaps suggest that the actual storm could have been started by Phobos hitting the side of Mars.
Nonetheless, the possibility of an impact event being the cause of the present super storm on Mars cannot, and should not be ignored.
The theory favored by NASA on the other hand, blames the current super storm on Mars on planetary events, while ignoring any possiblity of an impact event.
Tom Van Flandren, former lead astronomer at the Naval Observatory and NASA contractor, stated for the first time publicly he believes the cause of last months huge dust storm which surrounded the whole planet of Mars,  was most likely caused by an asteroid hit.
Malin Space Science Systems  MSSS  has secured virtually all of the Mars imaging market.
Nor is he the only one with the ability to control a spacecraft, but this tiny contracting company appears to have a virtual monopoly on Mars imagery, which means that Malin s theories are always center stage.
Malin also likes to flaunt his monopolistic over Mars imagery every now and then  “It’s good to be the King.
If Malin does have a monopoly Mars imagery, is it because he is the only skilled person in the world?
Theories being discussed include: grooves left by much smaller satellite debris also orbiting Mars  though the grooves seem to follow contours of Phobos  surface to closely for this to be tenable ; fractures radiating from an impact crater not yet recognized  perhaps on the side of Phobos still poorly photographed ; or fractures created in the body of the Martian satellite when it was part of a hypothetical larger body and that it spawned both Martian moons, perhaps during a catastrophic impact.
In the latest effort to photograph Mars and its moons, the NASA  Mars Observer  was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base in Florida in late 1992, on a 337 day voyage to Mars.
The Mars Observer initially was expected to arrive at Mars by 19 August 1993, and enter a long, elliptical orbit over the poles.
In mid November 1993 it was to begin its two year mapping of the surface of Mars.
Americans and the world mourned the loss of a valuable scientific tool for understanding Mars.
A dark shield was going up on new information about Mars to the public at large.
See  Alien Base , by Timothy Good, P.
He described the phenomenon as very puzzling, because the pattern seen on the surface of Mars was photographed not with the spacecraft s optical camera but with its infrared camera - a camera that takes pictures of objects using the heat they radiate, and not by the play of light and shadow on them.
Since no coordinates for the precise location of this  anomalous feature  have been released publicly, it is impossible to judge its relationship to another puzzling feature on the surface of Mars that can be seen in Mariner 9 frame 4209-75  pictured left .
An alien beacon?
Yesterday, the Houston Chronicle ran a story showing a picture from the Mars Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the fourth rock from the Sun since August 2012.
After all, they’re shots of the landscape on an alien world!
But some folks take the word “alien” a bit too metaphorically.

Alien Weapon Found On Mars?
I’m not saying the possibility of high weirdness on Mars is completely ruled out.
On the one hand, alien enthusiasm has caused for increased interest into certain topics like cranial modification and the Nasca lines.
On the other hand, it can be extremely frustrating having to deal with questions about the alien involvement in the construction of the pyramids or creation of crystal skulls.
Here are some of the more popular ‘alien’ related bioarchaeology finds.
Paracas Elongated Skull… Human Skull… Not Alien.
Some theorized that the deformation in the skull was a natural phenomenon, and these elongated skulls were evidence for a new type of species, likely with alien origins.
Over the last few years, there have been a number of pseudo-archaeologists who have gotten their hands on tissue samples from these skulls and argue that they have DNA proof that these are alien species.
They are humans with modified crania- no need to jump to alien conclusions.
Starchild Skull- also not an alien, just a child with a genetic condition, via Wikimedia.
As it is easy to see from the picture, the skull is extremely enlarged in the cranium, much like the aliens from Mars Attack!
But I’m content for now to look at the amazing human skeletal system, and watch alien movies in my free time.
You may recall, NASA recently announced that a strange rock had somehow  appeared  in front of its Mars Opportunity rover.
Not so, says self-described scientist Rhawn Joseph, an author of trade books on topics ranging from alien life to the Sept.
In fact, this isn t the first report of alien life to come out of the journal .
Europa: Are we looking in the wrong place for alien life?
This graphic shows the relative sizes of Earth, Mars and Europa, an icy moon of Jupiter.
A British astrobiology conference has revived a years-old debate over the best place to look for life elsewhere in the solar system: Mars, or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn?
However, proposals for NASA missions to Europa have been losing out, in part because of the cost of missions to Mars.
Last week s federal budget proposal for the next fiscal year provides no funding for a Europa mission , but it does fund Mars missions such as Maven  launching this year , InSight  launching in 2016  and a new science rover  launching in 2020 .
Saturn s largest moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere and seas of hydrocarbon that some scientists think could harbor a totally alien kind of life .
As for Mars, astrobiologists say hints of life could well lurk beneath the surface .
Moreover, NASA s vision calls for sending astronauts to Mars and its moons in the 2030s .
So what if all of these worlds — Mars and Europa, Callisto and Ganymede, Titan and Enceladus — turn out to be lifeless?
Scientists have a lot of ideas when it comes to exploring Mars, but one research team is eyeing a very unique approach.
Dubbed the ExoLance project, the initiative aims to fire arrowlike “penetrators” into the surface of Mars.
The nonprofit Explore Mars Inc.
There is still more work to be done, but we don t see anything that looks like a showstopper to get the 1 meter-plus depths we were hoping for … Once the concept is sufficiently tested and we have proven the viability of the mission concept, we will approach NASA, other space agencies, and potential commercial providers to carry ExoLance on one or more future Mars missions.
Is shooting mini-exploratory missiles into Mars a good idea?
This is the rat lizard alien that the Mars rover Curiosity recently spotted on the red planet .
Hit the jump for an ultra-poor quality closeup so all the hours some nutjob spent super-zooming into pictures from Mars wasn t in vain.
Thanks to Matt, who told me if he had a dime for every time somebody thought they saw an alien in some rock formation on Mars he s not sure how much money he d have.
It s not a rat lizard on Mars.
Martian alien rats-lizards taste like Earth chicken.
If an alien was advanced enough to make it to our system, I would think they d be able to observe us from space without having to reveal themselves to us.
Cause seriously, who wants to see alien privates?
He believes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is concealing the existence of aliens on the Moon and Mars.
Hoagland’s journey of “truth” began after completing an extensive examination of the Cydonia region of Mars, which contains the legendary Face and Giza-like pyramids.
He cites the still-unsolved disappearance of the Mars Observer as evidence.
I watched a Stephen Hawking documentary in which he suggested aquatic alien civilizations made live under the vast frozen sea on the outer moon Titan.
Some scientists say advanced alien civilizations may live near the centers of galaxies and harvest energy from the black holes.
Calling himself a  global space statesman,  Aldrin answered questions  about colonizing Mars, Elon Musk, his favorite movies about space and his appearance on  30 Rock.
Because OUR resources should be directed to outward, beyond-the-moon, to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of Mars that can be built, assembled, from the close-by moons of Mars.
Some people may be rooting for Elon -- I think he could, with his Space X, contribute considerably, enormously, to an international activity not only at the moon but also on Mars.
I have considered whether a landing on Mars could be done by the private sector.
It conflicts with my very strong idea, concept, conviction, that the first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth.
Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of 6-7 years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon.
Tourism trips to Mars and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from Earth - to have an individual company, no matter how smart, send people to Mars and bring them back, it is VERY very expensive.
A rock or alien life .
Before-and-after images of the same patch of ground in front of NASA s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity 13 days apart showing the  rock .
A strange oddly-shaped white rock mysteriously appeared in images taken less than two weeks apart by NASA  s Mars rover Opportunity , which is looking for signs of past water , the space agency reported on January 17.

DO YOU BELIEVE IN ALIEN LIFE?
A FORMER US marine has sensationally claimed that he has spent nearly a decade battling ALIENS on Mars.
Captain Kaye s incredible testimony to ExoNews TV doesn t end with Mars, either.

He s had enough of Hoagland s assertions that NASA is covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life, that the infamous Face on Mars was built by sentient aliens and, of late, that otherworldly machine parts are embedded in the Red Planet s dirt.
Recent Mars rover photos include not just rocks, Hoagland and other contributors maintain, but common objects that might tell of an alien civilization -- a bowl, a stove, a piston.
Plait has two words for the latest claims of alien objects on Mars.
Plait took a picture of the liquid Lenin and uses it illustrate his contention that, though objects on the surface of Mars can sometimes take on interesting shapes, they are just a bunch of rocks.
Hoagland said the names given to objects shown on his site are nicknames, just as the rover scientists came up with  blueberries  to describe small spherical objects on Mars.
We are not saying there are stoves or pistons on Mars,  Hoagland said in a telephone interview.
A headline on the home page flatly states that some objects on Mars are non-natural:  Spirit Sees  and Still Ignores  More Artificial Junk.
Hoagland is routinely critical of Stephen Squyres, a Cornell University astronomer who is mission manager for the Mars rover mission.
Meanwhile, a phenomenal flow of images from NASA s Mars rovers has created a cottage industry in scientific speculation about the Red Planet, at Hoagland s site and elsewhere.
Plait works to debunk several specific alien-related claims made on Hoagland s site, enterprisemission.
An image from the Mars Global Surveyor is said on Hoagland s site to be a gargantuan, glass-like worm that s a mile long.
Hoagland is perhaps best known for promoting the Viking Orbiter s  Face on Mars  image as evidence for an alien civilization.
There is a reasonable hypothesis that there could have been an ancient civilization on Mars,  Hoagland said, adding that the idea has a lot of adherents around the world.
The blogger alerted the website, UFO Sightings Daily, and incredibly, the “discovery” of “life” on Mars has sparked frenzied speculation.
The photo of the Mars “lizard” shows what looks like a reptile with feet, tail and a head.
But with the benefit of zoom, the presence of alien life is revealed.
Caves have   been found on Mars – and they could be home to alien life, scientists said   on Sunday.

This is, without a doubt, the best photo of NASA s Mars rover Curiosity.
In reality, the photo is a composition of multiple photos taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager  MAHLI  on February 3, 2013.
INTELLIHUB   — A new photo released by NASA shows a large beam of light emanating from the ground on Mars.
The picture was taken by the Mars curiosity rover.
Sure NASA could go and investigate it, but hey, they are not on Mars to discover life, but there to stall its discovery.
Is this light proof of alien life?
However, if there was life on Mars and NASA knew, they wouldn’t tell us.
Those lights are to see on moon and mars and Im sure it has an extraterrestrial source.
If there s one thing to be said for Curiosity s mission on Mars so far, it certainly hasn t been boring.
Although the six-wheeled rover has taken thousands of photographs of Martian rocks, the rich diversity of Mars  landscape has provided many beautiful examples of planetary geology and some geology that is downright weird.
Take this recent photographic example from the Mars Science Laboratory s Mastcam camera that was uploaded to the mission s photo archive on sol 746  Sept.
While compiling a mosaic of images of the surrounding landscape, Curiosity captured a rather un-Mars-like shape atop a rocky outcrop.
But knowing that Mars is somewhat lacking in the 16th-century battleship and golf cart departments, there was likely another answer.
Of course it s nothing man  or alien -made, despite what your brain might be telling you.
Yep, it s a spherical Mars rock.
Other examples of concretions have been found on the Martian surface before â€” take, for example, the tiny haematite concretions, or  blueberries , observed by Mars rover Opportunity in 2004 â€” and they were created during sedimentary rock formation when Mars was abundant in liquid water many millions of years ago.
By now we all know that Mars used to be a lot wetter than it is now.
On Earth, sedimentary rock is formed through the interaction of liquid water transporting and depositing material â€” the same process also occurred on Mars.
An unanticipated amount of wear and tear by the craggy Mars surface has taken its toll on Curiosity s wheels , causing dents, punctures and rips in the thin aluminum.
This has prompted rover drivers to drive the rover backwards to limit the damage and to get help from NASA s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to image the surrounding landscape, finding the smoothest routes.
But so far, so good, Curiosity is at Mount Sharp to continue its scientific investigation into Mars  habitable history.
This before-and-after pair of images of the same patch of ground in front of NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity 13 days apart documents the arrival of a bright rock onto the scene.

Irish director Ruairi Robinson’s sci-fi horror The Last Days on Mars might make space travel enthusiasts a little less eager to emigrate to the planet next door.
Shot on location in Jordan and at Shepperton Studios on the UK, the film tells the story of a group of astronauts who are collecting specimens on Mars when they discover some specimens that probably should have been left behind.
Based on a short story by Sydney James Bounds and adapted by the screen by Clive Dawson  The Bunker , The Last Days on Mars screened at Cannes Film Festival earlier this year and is set for a late 2013 release.
Two new trailers for The Last Days on Mars have now been released, offering a first look at the next stage of Robinson’s directing career.
The trailers give away very little about the plot and main threat of The Last Days on Mars, but they do succeed in showcasing some the ensemble cast who will no doubt be the driving force behind the drama.
It’s Schreiber’s visage, however, that heavily dominates the poster for The Last Days of Mars, the formatting of which unfortunately makes it look like a tiny astronaut is running away from a giant Schreiber that’s about to eat him.
One thing that comes across strongly in both trailers is a very clear  Alien  vibe, right down to the characters finding something under the planet’s surface, a crewmember returning to the ship with a broken faceplate and something that looks like it could be a chest-bursting scene.
If Last Days of Mars is an Alien rip-off, however, that’s not necessarily a bad thing; if The Last Days on Mars is going to borrow heavily from another movie then Alien has some very deep pockets.
Besides which, The Last Days on Mars looks just different enough to get away with it, featuring what looks like zombified humans as its main monsters and set on the surface of Mars rather than in the confines of a spaceship.
The Last Days on Mars will be available to order on VOD from October 31st, 2013, and will also receive a limited theatrical release on December 6th.

The planet Mars needs no introduction as a possible candidate for harboring alien life, or for capturing the imagination of man.
Many have opined that Mars has always held a special fascination for mankind, and thus now to humans looking for ET, Mars has rarely been left out of such conversations.
Of course, this lack of proof hasn’t stopped people from claiming Mars was once full of intelligent life, and potentially the origin of life on earth.
It’s understandable, there is a romanticism to the idea of life on Mars.
Schiaparelli and later Lowell’s  Martian “canals” of course inspired dozens of science fiction stories like Burroughs’ excellent John Carter novel series, Otis Kline’s lesser known, but just as entertaining Mars Venus stories and a host of others, including CS Lewis’ Out of the Silent Planet.
The canals, and other long ago ideas that inspired the idea of Martian life were for the most part dispelled when the Soviets and NASA began to send space probes to Mars .
Yes, the Russians beat us to Mars.
These probes revealed that Mars is pretty much devoid of life and always has been.
On the odd chance that microbial life was found on Mars, I’m not even sure it would be that big of a deal in actuality .
He also suggested that many times in the past claims for life on Mars have been made, and society still moved on.
At any rate, this claim that Viking found life is probably the most conservative claim of life on Mars, “it’s possible, maybe we did, but we’re not sure”.
From here, less and less reliable claims of life on Mars have been made.
Some two decades after Viking, when I was in high school, I recall seeing a news conference about a meteorite allegedly from Mars.
The hoopla being that this rock was from Mars, and had fossilized bacteria or some such from Mars.
I also wondered how they determined it was from Mars in the first place and not just a normal meteroite.
How did they know the alleged bacteria was from Mars and not contamination from Earth?
The idea that a meteorite landed on Mars, kicked up debris that wandered to earth and somehow survived atmosphere entry into earth and still left enough material to study.
Fast forward to now, the wiki article mentions what sounds like good science that supports the Martian origin of the meteorite, as well as a halfway decent explanation as to why scientists think it could be life from Mars.
In short the evidence on both sides is incomplete, no one knows for sure if this meteorite actually contained signs of life, and really it seems very hard to say with absolute certainty that it actually came from Mars.
At least without performing further study of Mars.
My gut tells me it’s a normal meteorite, not from Mars, and there aren’t any bacteria fossils.
So really, while there may be others, those few items are the most mainstream claims that life exists or has existed on ancient Mars.
In brief, possible traces of bacterial life on Mars.
Jim Marrs’ book Alien Agenda outlines that remote viewers have discovered that Mars suffered a cataclysm in the distant past  Rahab, anyone?
Some other survivors are said to have relocated underground on Earth and possibly Mars.
Moving on from there, a number of individuals in the Christian fringe support the idea of ruins on Mars, and that they are the ruins of fallen angels nephilim either from Mars or from the inhabitants of planet Rahab .
This link takes a critical look at Flynn’s claims as well as the claims about Mars made by other Christians.
To focus in on Flynn’s claims, as I understand them, he essentially connected the Face on Mars and alleged pyramids in the Cydonia region to Satan, by connecting the supposed structures and related geometric measurements to mystery religions here on earth.
The Rahab theory really is no different from any other similar theory except that it becomes Satan’s planet, and that these beings left ruins on Mars.
The other ringleader that most everyone builds off of, the originator and loudest proponent of ruins on Mars and associated  often Masonic  conspiracies and coverups would be none other than Richard C.
Hoagland is a rather persuasive voice to be sure, and in fact nearly had me convinced of not only oxygen on Mars, and NASA cover-ups, but ruins on Mars and the moon.
Where Hoagland gets into trouble, is that he not only claims there were alien structures on the moon, but that the Viking lander found signs of life  see above  and discovered the monuments on Mars.
However, if Hoagland is wrong, then the best proof for intelligent life on Mars and ancient alien ruins would be more or less rendered moot until better evidence comes forth.
First and foremost, the idea for pyramids on Mars came not from NASA photos, but from a science fiction novel “ Edison’s Conquest of Mars “, which is addressed summarized pretty well in one of Valdron’s articles.
The face on Mars too preceded NASA in a Jack Kirby comic.
The pyramidal shape doesn’t go away, unlike the Face on Mars.
Given that Cydonia is just a geologically weird area and not a pyramid complex, the Face of Mars should be easy to discern as well.
Not to mention, for an agency that’s reportedly underfunded, finding an alien artifact would be a sure way to obtain funding.
Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars — evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.
Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.
And with that, the entire plot of Mission to Mars or Red Planet  I forget which  is rendered moot.
Hoagland’s, Flynn’s and other theories about alien monuments on Mars can probably be discarded as incorrect, especially regarding Cydonia.
Although this evidence goes a long way to dispel claims of ancient alien life on Barsoom…I mean Mars, there are still more claims to deal with.
Like the nuclear annihilation of Mars.
It could be natural, like what happened in Africa, or it could be unnatural, ergo Mars was “murdered.
Additional evidence are hotspots of thorium and potassium on Mars which he also links to this event.
Although we disagree about the Biblical creation account, it’s good reading and explains quite thoroughly why Mars was probably not wiped out by ET atomic bombs.
Wrapping up, a few other Mars oddities can be dealt with.
Namely, Mars’ moon Phobos is not a hollow ship made to look like an asteroid .
Much to the dismay of my younger self, the ruins of Mars really are natural features and it’s not likely evidence of Barsoom, Tharks or John Carter’s adventures will ever be found.

New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from     NASA s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars     for what it really is: a mesa.
May     24, 2001 -- Twenty five years ago something funny happened     around Mars.
Above: A 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars.
Click     here for a 2001 photo from Mars Global Surveyor that reveals     the true appearance of the Face.
The     authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public     and attract attention to Mars.
The  Face on Mars  has since become a pop icon.
Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide,     say conspiracy theorists.
Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget     wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.
Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact,     photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor  MGS  arrived at the Red Planet in Sept.
We felt this     was important to taxpayers,  explained Jim Garvin, chief     scientist for NASA s Mars Exploration Program.
And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over     Cydonia for the first time, Michael     Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera  MOC  team snapped a picture     ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.
There was no alien monument after all.
Above: Side by side: a Viking 1 photo from 1976, a Mars     Global Surveyor  MGS  image from 1998, and the latest MGS image     from 2001.
The Face on Mars is located     at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April      98 -- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.
Perhaps,     said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.
Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 -- a     cloudless summer day in Cydonia -- Mars Global Surveyor drew     close enough for a second look.
That s a lava dome that takes     the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face     on Mars.
Garvin and other members of the MGS Science Team have     studied them carefully, however, using a laser altimeter called       MOLA       on board Mars Global Surveyor.
Above: A 3D perspective view of the Face on Mars landform     produced by Jim Garvin  NASA  and Jim Frawley  Herring Bay Geophysics      from the latest MOC image  April 8, 2001  and all of the available     laser altimeter elevation measurements by MOLA.
The mesas of Cydonia are of great interest to planetary geologists     because they lie in a curious part of Mars, in a transition zone     between cratered highlands to the south and smoother lowland     plains to the north.

That s     why the Face on Mars was so popular: it reinforced that connection.
But even without an alien monument, there will be plenty for     future explorers to do.
Unmasking the Face on Mars wasn t easy!
But Michael Malin     and his team at Malin Space Science     Systems have done it by virtue of their hard work targeting     the Face with the Mars Orbiter Camera  MOC .

Highest-Resolution View of      Face on Mars  -- On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor captured the best-ever     view of the face and proved it is really an ordinary Martian     mesa.
UFO spotters are claiming they have spotted an alien skull on Mars after NASA beamed back satellite images from the planet.

Previous images of a skull spotted on Mars in 2006  were believed to have been the result of tampering.

In 1896 the American astronomer Percival Lowell hypothesised about  Mars as the abode of life.
He presumed that an advanced civilisation had flourished on Mars, but was dying, despite its desperate attempts to re-engineer its climate by using those canals to tap the planet s polar ice caps for water.
As David Bowie, another alien who fell to Earth, sang in Life on Mars :  It s a Godawful small affair.
Facts: Before space exploration, Mars was considered the best candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.
But now we know that the surface of Mars is frigid, dry and windswept and with an atmosphere inhospitable to life as we know it.
If scientists are to discover life on Mars, it could be in a form that they have not yet considered, for example in ice at the poles or in minute traces of water that may still exist somewhere on the planet.
Hagen set out to imagine what might have existed on Mars 3.
Although current knowledge suggests that Mars  warm, wet period was too brief to evolve complex life, it is an interesting exercise to speculate on what might have evolved in sustained habitable niches.
Hagen has imagined that Mars  plant and animal ecology developed in the oceans and the wet margins of land, and that the base of the chain of  life on Mars was photosynthesis.
Alien Weapon Found On Mars?
Conspiracy theorists are excited to announce that they believe they have found something which seems to be an ‘alien thigh bone’ on Mars based on photographs sent back by NASA s Curiosity rover.
The rover’s MastCam captured the bone-shaped object on August 14, leading many to believe that they have found proof that large animals once roamed Mars.
On its 100th anniversary, The Great Martian War tells the story of the catastrophic events and unimaginable horrors of 1913-17, when Humankind was pitted against a savage Alien invasion.
The setting is Mars.
Twelve spacecraft have already landed or crashed on Mars, possibly carrying microorganisms from Earth.
Some microorganisms called extremophiles might survive and grow in extreme, Mars-like conditions -- such as very low-temperature and high-salt environments.
Should these organisms go undetected and survive the trip to Mars, their chance of survival is increased if they encounter water -- although the presence of liquid water on or below the Martian surface today has not been confirmed.
To prevent contamination of Mars and avoid hampering efforts to find life there, NASA should develop over the coming decade new measures to detect and eliminate microorganisms on robotic spacecraft before they leave Earth, says a new report from the National Research Council.
By preventing the introduction of Earth microbes to Mars, scientists may one day find life forms genuinely native to the red planet.

A photograph snapped by mars curiosity rover, appears to show a Martian weapon of some kind.
Take the time to compare the layout pattern of Tikal and Stonehenge with the flash graphic of Mars and compare how all portray the stars of the Pleiades.
Update September 2009: The highlight of the Hidden Records book has to be this comparitive measurement  above  between all the stars of the Pleiades and all the anomalies in the Mars cluster in Cydonia.
All in all, 28 spectacular correlations where the Mars presentation still has one major piece of evidence that makes it far beyond just coincidence.
A documentary titled  Ancient Aliens  on the History Channel 15th March 2009 aired footage of my Mars Pleiades and Tikal starmap findings.
All credits for the sources of the Mars images go to all the                     hardworking NASA teams extracting images from Themis, Observer                     and other satellites orbiting Mars.
I have presented this a little lower down with the meaning of the Face on Mars.
See the Solar Sun  god  faces that follow to compare reasoning of the face style and how the face is the  x  that mars the spot in the Mars star map.
If the face on Mars is the  x  that marks the spot, it therefore seems likely that the star maps that I have deciphered are involving perhaps a few planets belonging to the Grey entities.
Now here is a little reasoning behind the  TV line  style in the Alien message.
The 4 faces in a group in the image above are 4 examples of Solar deities found globally and on Mars.
Is it suggesting the  x  monument marking the spot will be excavated and something  alien  will be found beneath it?
IMAGE RELEASE  NEW EVIDENCE - MARS FACE IS BUILT FROM STONE BLOCKS!
The evidence you are about to explore on this page will no doubt make this website one of the leading research sites on the internet in archaeoastronomy and the subject of the Mars pyramids of Cydonia.
The findings that follow will convincingly prove that the anomalies on Mars were not only built by advanced life but built perhaps by our very own ancestors.
The most convincing and strongest case, proving the existence of advanced intelligent life on Mars, is right here: The blocks found on the Mars Face  above .
The image here is of the Face of Mars showing various block sand debris patterns, all of which match pyramid ruins in Egypt partially covered by sand.
From the recent discovery  bottom of page  that Mars once had oceans like Earth, to finding moss or algae and remains of a remarkable fossil on Mars.
The first ever high resolution image of the face on Mars was made available two years ago by NASA JPL through the HIRISE PROJECT at The University of Arizona but the image was so large that computers in 2007 were either unable to complete the download or simply open it before it would crash them.
The Mars face has them all, and it is not surprising since the planet at some point in its history experienced a meteorite impact event that ended it, leaving a 2000 km wide impact crater.
The 2007 image of the Face on Mars made available to researchers was so large that even viewing it in an image window still kept crashing computers.
There was another matching debris pattern with another important portion on the Mars Face.
Researches have already suggested the Mars Face experienced at least five direct impacts by meteorites  remains of five craters in shadowed section now very clear .
Also they speak of a large directional planet crust shift, apparently moving suddenly to the right, during what would have been a Mars-quake well above a magnitude 10.
In his book published in 2003 I already identified some of the largest blocks, daring to suggest at that time that the Mars face was built of blocks and that the Face on Mars has a very definite left eye.
I knew I was able to overcome all the problems in the newly released satellite image where I could digitally overlay shades of appropriate colour found in more recent Mars images for this area.
But for me there was something more valuable that would prove the 3D value of the Mars face seen in some other more recent low resolution images.
By adding slight colour and by producing an overlay mask sourced from the 20 year old Viking image of the Mars Face, then overlay it onto a 2003 overhead sun shot I had a spectacular end result.
In doing this I produced the first clear image on the face on Mars with the appropriate 3D sun angle interpretation.
So to achieve a scientific comparison to a 3D human face, one would need to compare the effect of natural lighting on a human face with what could be a real human face carving on Mars.
The part of the Mars face with the most apparent damage is the area of the lower mouth.
Sensational new findings of massive quantities of water on Mars for some unknown reason have been prevented from main news media.
The mystery behind the giant  splat  craters is no longer a mystery as it seem reasonable to say that some impacts hit a suddenly exposed muddy ocean floor after the cataclysmic primary impact event on Mars.
An impact event that destroyed Mars creating a 2000km wide impact crater called the Hellas Basin.
Also frozen water permanently available in craters, perhaps of great use to the future mars landing is just as important.
This finding is also not well known and especially surprising since its exciting potential making the Mars trip a lot safer with a smaller water payload demand.
MORE ALGAE OR MOSS UNRECOGNISED ON MARS?
The image below is sourced from ESA Mars Express and it was one taken with special colour sensitive film.
A space scientist believes there is now a lot of proof of life on Mars but it is not being released.
NASA has announced at a press conference that it can confirm a South American astronomer making the claim that massive quantities of methane gas is currently being released on Mars!
It is as if they dont want people to think life is or was ever possible on Mars!
The Mars Beagle probe a few years ago also had very expensive equipment on board to detect methane for one reason and for one reason only if it could detect methane it would be able to prove micro biological life on Mars exists.
Now that the cat is out the bag, scientists seem more interested in disproving the possibility of life on Mars by trying to prove the only other explanation for the methane recent volcanism and surface lava flows something they always insisted previously was absolutely impossible.
They always said Mars was a volcanically extinct planet.
The methane gas is mainly found around the warmer equatorial areas on Mars so it is more likely to be that discharged by microbial life living in the damp soil around the equator.
There have been Mars temperatures across the surface everywhere not much different to the average Canadian winter, and those are the warm readings.
The next finding I made now makes a lot more sense algae or moss seen on Mars yet no comments from NASA.
ANCIENT ARTEFACT - HELMET ON MARS ?
The image that follows is sourced from Spirit Mars rover from NASA and it is of something that creates a whole new conspiracy theory.
Clark and many others coincidently knew about the face on Mars by including it in their books many years before any Earth probe was anywhere near Mars.
His Storm Troopers also have a face just like the viking image of the Mars face too.
If the advanced inhabitants on Mars knew a debris field of meteorites was heading their way and they could not evacuate all its world population they would need to prepare its people with protective space suits of some sort.
Those needing evacuation shortly after the cataclysmic event that ended Mars are in question here.
If any ancient artefact was ever discovered on Earth and kept secret because it depicted the last people on Mars like storm troopers, it is no wonder at all that the ancients believed Mars was linked to beings revered as gods of war!
October 2006 - Recently scientists released a series of very                   interesting photographs of the face anomaly on Mars.
Please note: Those not familiar with my star correlation                   theory on Mars outlined in  The Hidden Records  may find the hypotheses                   that follows hard to follow and might believe this is merely another                   attempt to revive the disputed face anomaly as a face.
During my research before publishing in 2003, when reasoning my                 Mars interpretations I came up with a correlation problem that                 remained inconclusive.
If the Mars                     pyramids were real pyramid ruins, why did the face anomaly have                     nothing to do with a form of pyramid interpretation that marks                     the spot like in Egypt?
The first alignment that became apparent to him on Mars was                     to be found in the D&M five-sided pyramid.
Two of this pyramid s                     sides are much longer than the rest  see image below to see                     the resultant alignment line and the Mars star map at the top                     of the page to see the complete line .
It does so at a very ancient epoch 17250 years ago and this                     is how I have dated the Mars monuments.
Shortly before publishing, I magnified the forehead region                     of the Mars face high resolution image  see book p.
Would one not expect                 the same phenomenon for Mars if we dare to consider it was once                 an Earth linked pyramid civilisation before perishing?
The image shown here highlights the coordinates                 from the three pages referred to above and it is depicted here as                 one single overlay over the Mars face  from a statue of Zeus  positioned                 in space where the Sun-like star passes.
I noticed something                 else since going to print, which could be important in deciphering                 the Mars star map message.
Here is a rebuild model of what may have been                 on Mars.
Authorities seem quite adamant in their new depiction of the Mars                 anomaly with  unfair  overhead Sun angle and weird colour tones                 and blur that do a splendid job presenting it like a hill.
In Oct 2006 A  New Scientist  media                 release claims an exciting breakthrough that is perhaps more important than the recent frozen ocean discovery: That Mars once had planet-wide                 oceans and was once a blue planet so to speak.

He found some structures on a hill in one of the Mars Curiosity rover photos.
Is NASA trying to move the rover away from these obstacles to prevent the public from learning about life on Mars?
According to the fringe sector of the Internet, Mars is practically teeming with aliens.
But the much-discussed  anomaly  turned out not to be a sign of alien activity, but rather the plume of dust kicked up by the sky crane that delivered the rover close to the Martian surface, then veered off and struck the ground some 2,000 feet  600 meters  away.
Four objects caught by Mars Curiosity, very difficult to make out on original image so I have used a few filters to highlight,  he said in the video description.
All CCD  have them, and in a bland atmosphere like that at Mars, they would be very obvious as opposed to an active atmosphere like Earth, where they could end up hidden for a long time before anyone noticed them.
This leaves viewers to contemplate which is more likely: that Curiosity happened to capture UFOs in the very first photos it took of Mars, that NASA removed the UFOs and released the scrubbed photos, then accidentally leaked the originals to  ParanormalCollection  — or that this YouTube user simply took the photos released by NASA, added a sequence of white dots to them in Photoshop, and posted the creation to YouTube?

Retired Soldier Says He Spent 17 Years Battling Aliens on Mars!
Exactly three weeks after its identical twin set down on Mars, NASA’s Opportunity rover landed late Saturday and sent back pictures of Martian terrain unlike any seen before.
Opportunity has touched down in a bizarre, alien landscape.
Squyres said the slabs were  the first bedrock outcrop ever found on Mars,  and he speculated that the rover may have landed within a crater because of the look of the skyline.
The first bedrock ever seen by a Mars lander is visible in the background of this image, captured by Opportunity s navigation camera.
Like Spirit, Opportunity had to execute a choreographed sequence of events to ensure its safe arrival on Mars.
Gray hematite could provide new clues in the search for evidence that Mars could have supported life millions or billions of years ago.

For all of you who long to believe there s intelligent life on Mars, NASA s curiosity rover has some evidence that s hard to overlook.
Either way, the amazing video gives even the hardest skeptic pause, despite the overwhelming evidence that any form of life on Mars is impossible.
The photos are then minutely scrutinized by a cadre of UFO and alien hunters looking to find the first, indisputable evidence of life off the Earth.
The atmosphere of Mars cannot sustain human life, much less a thriving lion pride.
Is it possible Mars once hosted the kind of diverse wildlife only, so far, found on Earth?
Whether this video shows actual evidence of a planet teeming with life, even to the level of sustaining an entire pride of lions, in Mars  distant past, will be difficult to prove.
The author herself raises the possibility that the rover is not even on Mars, but transmitting photos of a remote desert region right here on Earth, implying NASA may be engaged in a massive cover-up to fool the world.
Is this evidence that Mars once had lions?
Is the Curiosity rover actually on Mars?
If those are bones on Mars.
Instead of fossils on Mars it s probably just another NASA hoax.
If we can make other countries  think  we sent something to Mars.
That being said, according to Graz Hancock life came from Mars, to Earth possibly Or that Planet X Nibiru destroyed what was then Tiamat and is now Mars.
No alteration of the images occurred which were all taken directly from the NASA JPL website created for storing Mars Rover imagery.
Given that NASA experts refuse to discuss such a  Hard evidence has been found that there is some kind of indigenous life roaming the surface of Mars.
