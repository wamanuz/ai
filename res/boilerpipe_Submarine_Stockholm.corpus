The submarine hunts or submarine incidents were a series of several incidents involving foreign submarines that occurred in Swedish territorial waters during the Cold War .
In this time, there was intensive debate and speculation in Swedish media about the possibility of Soviet submarine infiltration of Swedish territorial waters .
While there had been earlier incidents involving foreign submarines  as seen below , the incidents normally referred to in this context are those that followed the sensational stranding of the Soviet submarine U 137 deep inside Swedish waters on October 27, 1981.
The Swedish Navy responded aggressively to these perceived threats, increasing patrols in Swedish waters, mining and electronically monitoring passages, and repeatedly chasing and attacking suspected submarines with depth charge bombs, but no hits or casualties were ever recorded.
Reports of new submarine sightings and television imagery of Swedish Navy helicopters firing depth charges into coastal waters against suspected intruders became commonplace in the mid-to-late 1980s.
They remain, for many Swedes, one of the iconic images of the Cold War and of the Swedish relation to the Soviet Union—for some underlining what was considered a major threat to Swedish sovereignty, while for others illustrating the tense atmosphere of the time.
However, the reports of these incidents are not uncontested, and an intensive debate emerged early on.
This debate unfolded somewhat, but far from exclusively, along leftwing rightwing lines, and became tied up with the larger issues of relations to Moscow and Swedish armed neutrality .
The Soviet Union consistently denied that it was responsible for violating Swedish waters, and claimed that the U 137 had only crossed the border because of navigational faults.
Russia today maintains this stand.
While the submarine sightings subsided with the fall of the Soviet Union, the debate about these events has reemerged sporadically.
They have been the subject of a number of government investigations in Sweden, and continue to attract media attention.
During a military exercise, a submarine is discovered by radar echo and hydrophone, north of Fårö at Gotland.
It retreats only after repeated depth charge strikes.
At 0500 a submarine was reported being sighted in Gullmarsfjorden and warning shots were fired by nearby forces.
Other sightings followed by warning shots were repeated during the following days.
After many days of continued search for submarines in the vicinity something suddenly happened.
At October 24 at mid day a submarine turret was spotted outside the naval depot ÖGull, deep inside Gullmarsfjorden.
Two fishing type mine sweepers from the mine sweeping division at Lysekil immediately went out and managed to establish sonar contact with an object standing still at 10 meters below surface.
After having established the exact position of the underwater object, the minesweeper Hasslö was called in to fire warning shots at the location, while the other minesweepers kept contact with their sonar.
Contact was lost briefly due to stirred up water and the sweeper s propeller wake.
After two hours since the first sighting one of the minesweepers managed to position itself on top of the located object.
It then lowered a cable with a 100kg weight attached to confirm the existence of a solid underwater object.
The wire slacked at a depth of 10m.
As the sweeper moved forwards the weight was dragged on top of the object for a while and then fell down, stretching the wire as it did so.
Immediately after this, the other sweepers both noticed stirred up water, a possible sign of submarine propellers in motion.
The sweeper Hasslö then dropped a depth charge 300m away from the echo location and soon after got a radar contact from an object having breached the surface and went down again.
Another depth charge was dropped, this time on the exact target location.
The echo now disappeared and was not found again despite the search going on through the night followed by helicopters joining in the morning.
At dawn  now the 25th  Hasslö moved southwards and after a while its crew spotted a submarine periscope above the surface.
The helicopter group was scrambled to the location, managed to establish contact with the submarine and attacked with depth charges.
After that the contact with the submarine was lost.
During a naval drill on the coast of Norrland, the Swedish submarine Springaren comes into contact with a foreign submarine in Swedish waters; it leaves the scene.
A submarine periscope is spotted by the Swedish Coast Guard near Kappelhamnsviken on Gotland .
A destroyer is sent to the scene and establishes contact, at which point the foreign submarine leaves Swedish waters.
During a naval drill in the Stockholm Archipelago, a Soviet Type W submarine exposes itself by using radar, outside Swedish territorial waters.
A Swedish submarine monitors the Soviet vessel entering Swedish waters, and records sounds from it.
When Swedish submarine-hunting helicopters and destroyers arrive, it speeds out towards international waters and disappears.
The Swedish Marine tugboat Ajax discovers the turret of a submarine outside Utö in the Stockholm Archipelago .
Submarine hunting helicopters are dispatched to the scene, establish contact, and fire warning shots.
The submarine does not leave the area, but attempts to avoid capture, and a prolonged submarine hunt began.
This lasted for several weeks, during which time the submarine is repeatedly sighted.
The U 137 incident .
On the evening of October 28, 1981, a fisherman residing in the eastern part of the Karlskrona archipelago phoned in to the Swedish Coast Guard and reported that a submarine had run aground in Gåsefjärden , 30 km from the town centre of Karlskrona.
Originally, it was not taken seriously because of its location, as Gåsefjärden is a very difficult terrain to navigate in, as well as being a  dead end .
Nevertheless, the fisherman was right, and the vessel was found to be of Soviet origin.
The grounded submarine generated intense media interest, and Swedish military forces were put on high alert following suspicions that the Soviet Union would try to recapture the vessel.
After several rounds of interrogation, the conservative   Liberal government led by Thorbjörn Fälldin decided to release both the vessel and its crew.
This marked the beginning of the  submarine hunts   ubåtsjakter , as nicknamed by Swedish media.
The Hårsfjärden incident.
After a long period of submarine incidents, the Swedish Navy sets a trap by sealing off an area with mines and sensors.
A foreign submarine is then recognized to have entered the trap, and the navy responds in force with major forces stationed nearby.
A reported 44 depth charges and 4 naval mines are detonated, trying to sink the submarine, but it is later determined that it avoided the trap or fled at an early stage.
This incident triggers the appointment of a parliamentary committee under the leadership of Sven Andersson , which—partly due to the efforts of Carl Bildt —blames the Soviet Union , thereby escalating tension with Moscow .
Later research has cast doubt on many of the conclusions of the committee, with some of the sound recordings from the purported submarine now believed to have come from a civilian ship.
6] The entire incident is now hotly disputed, with some arguing the submarine may have been of NATO origin.
A suspected submarine is reported in Törefjärden , North of Luleå , and mines are detonated.
Submarine hunt outside Sundsvall .
Helicopters establish contact with a foreign submarine, but are unable to fire, reportedly because civilian journalists have entered the safety area.
Submarine hunt in the harbor area of Karlskrona and in the adjoining archipelago.
Depth charges are fired inside Karlskrona harbor.
Another submarine hunt in Karlskrona .
22 depth charges are fired against a suspected submarine.
A  mysterious object  is reported  diving into the water  in Klintehamnsviken on Gotland .
The sea floor is examined, and double-track trace is discovered, allegedly from a submarine vehicle, extending 1100 meters.
While examining the magnetic sensors of a minefield in Kappelshamnsviken on Gotland , the military discovers  clear traces on the bottom from a tracked submarine vehicle .
A suspected foreign submarine is noticed in Hävringebukten outside Oxelösund .
Submarine sounds and air venting is said to have been recorded.
A possible foreign submarine is noticed in Baggensfjärden in Nacka .
The Swedish Armed Forces  Naval Tactical intelligence service, MTS-M2 investigated the incident.
9] Later it was confirmed that the object was really a raft frozen in moving ice.
An eyewitness contacts the Swedish armed forces after seeing something outside the harbor of Gothenburg that possibly could have been a foreign submarine.
The Swedish Navy deployed several surface warships in an attempt to locate the unknown object.
A large military operation is launched to search for an allegedly damaged submarine in Kanholmsfjärden in the Stockholm archipelago .
Encrypted transmissions sent on an emergency radio frequency used by Russian units were recorded.
The sources of the transmissions were identified as a submarine and a military site in the Kaliningrad region.
13]    On 19 October the military said there had been three separate sightings and released a picture of the unidentified submarine to the public.
17] There were also suggestions that the Russian Oil-tanker NS Concord was involved as a mother-ship for smaller underwater vehicles as it maintained a pattern of criss-crossing outside Stockholm during the investigation.
18] A Russian research ship equipped with a submarine holding bay, R V Professor Logachev ,   was also in the area and turned off its location transponder.
21]  Several days later, the hunt was still on as officials were certain that foreign underwater operations were still ongoing.
23] More than 100 sightings were now reported, said Supreme Commander Göransson.
24] Paul Schwartz at Center for Strategic and International Studies , CSIS, said the photograph could be a Russian Lada-class submarine .
As noted above, these events have been hotly disputed in Swedish media and by politicians and journalists active during the time.
U 137 , many of the supposed submarine incidents were based on intelligence reports, radar, underwater sensors, or witness statements, giving a less than full picture of the source of the disturbance.
As a result, there is no clear consensus on the extent of possible infiltration, or on whether trespassing submarines were necessarily of Soviet origin.
Some suggest that NATO submarines may have been responsible for the most well-known incidents, which has led to a further line of debate, on whether such submarines were secretly allowed to exit Swedish waters unpursued — that would have been in contravention of the publicly declared Swedish neutrality .
There is also a dispute concerning sound recordings purported to be of submarine engines, which some now allege stem from natural sounds, fish, mink , civilian vessels, etc.
The discussion also focuses on whether U 137 was sent to spy on Swedish defenses  supported by the large number of similar suspected espionage infiltrations, and by the depth to which it had penetrated , or, as its captain claimed, was lost because of a navigational error  supported by the fact that it ran aground .
Furthermore, there is a debate on whether this vessel was armed with nuclear weapons .
Swedish military teams are said to have registered high levels of radiation on geiger counters when examining the stranded submarine.
Twenty years after the events, they still generate controversy in modern-day Swedish politics, with prominent politicians and former military officials active on both sides of the dispute.
Following the stranding of a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine in 1981 on the Swedish archipelago, a series of massive submarine intrusions took place within Swedish waters.
However, the evidence for these appears to have been manipulated or simply invented.
Classified documents and interviews point to covert Western, rather than Soviet activity.
This is backed up by former US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who stated that Western  testing  operations were carried out regularly in Swedish waters.
Royal Navy submarine captains have also admitted to top-secret operations.
The incursions during 1982 and 1983 form a basis for the plot of The Troubled Man  Den orolige mannen , the final Kurt Wallander novel written by Swedish author Henning Mankell and published in 2009.
Mankell considered the incursions to be one of the worst scandals in Swedish political history.
28] Mankell’s play Politik, which debuted in autumn 2010, also dealt with the submarine incidents.
In 1984 a Finn living in Sweden published the satirical Finnish novel Probable Submarine  Todennäköinen sukellusvene  under the pen-name Klaus Viking.
The work was later translated to Swedish as Sannolik u-båt by Paul Jansson.
The novel is an examination of Swedish culture and politics as seen through the eyes of a Finnish immigrant who takes it upon himself to create some excitement by constructing a sham submarine and towing it through a restricted military area of the archipelago.
It reflects a certain degree of amusement with which some segments of Sweden s neighbor populations regarded the country s recurrent searches for submarine violations of its territorial integrity.

New technology has helped researchers in Sweden solve a 26-year-old deep sea mystery.
In 1982, Sweden claimed that it had recordings from a Soviet submarine in the waters of the Stockholm archipelago.
The recording was made during a submarine hunt by the Swedish military on October 12th, 1982.
It strengthened suspicions that Soviet subs were intruding in Swedish waters.
There were good grounds for such suspicion.
Just a year before the recording was made, in October 1981, the Russian diesel Submarine W-137 got stuck on an underwater rock about a mile from the Swedish main Naval Base at Karlskrona.
The sub remained on the rock for nearly 10 days.
The Russian Navy sent a rescue task force to the Swedish shores, composed of heavily armed destroyers and high sea tugs.
After days of negotiations between Moscow and Stockholm, the master on the Russian Submarine was summoned ashore for a hearing.
The case was swept under the rug and the Soviet sub was released and the case was closed.
The matter was front-page news and closely watched by international media: CBS, BBC, ATV and others.
That was the first and the only time a Soviet sub officially violated the borders of Sweden.
Nowadays, the Swedish Defence Research Agency  FOI  was determined to find whether the sound on the 1982 tape came from a submarine or surface vessel’s propeller.
This spring FOI learned that a civil vessel, the charter boat Amalia, happened to be near the area of the Swedish Navy operation when the recording was made in 1982.
Luckily enough, Amalia lasted until 2008 and a test recording of Amalia’s working propeller was made in April.
The conclusion is that it was likely the charter boat Amalia, which was in the area the same day, which is the source of the noise from a propeller found on the recording,” concluded the agency’s statement.
Roger Magnegard, the spokesman for the Swedish Armed Forces, welcomed the finding, but said it did not disprove the theory that Soviet subs were present in the archipelago at the time.
This is one part of the puzzle,” he said.
Back in 1982 the incident resulted in Operation Notvarp, the most advanced known secret submarine hunting operation ever undertaken by Sweden’s Armed Forces.
During the operation, all of Sweden s submarine hunting forces concentrated in one location following a number of suspected intrusions.
This “submarine fishing” operation implied trapping a presumed foreign submarine and forcing it to the surface by dropping depth charges.
Not a single submarine surfaced as a result.
Soon after the operation finished, Sweden launched a special submarine commission which in the spring of 1983 concluded that the USSR was behind the intrusions.
The sitting Swedish government at the time recalled Sweden s ambassador to Moscow and registered an uncharacteristically strong protest to the Soviet government.
The centre-right opposition backed up the government.
This old rumble is still poisoning Russo-Swedish relations, even after a quarter of a century.
One of the strongest objectives against constructing the Russia-EU gas pipeline, Nord Stream, is that an undersea pipeline will supposedly increase activity of Russian submarines in the waters surrounding Scandinavia.
This is not the first time Swedish experts questioned the “Russian origin” of the sounds on the 25-year-old recording.
Some experts insist that propeller noises were mixed up with the sounds of nature, while others suspect other NATO members tested the defence of a neutral Sweden.
After spending a week scouring the waters off Stockholm for a reportedly Russian submarine, the Swedish Navy has given up.
On Friday, the country s military reported that the vessel  or vessels  in question have left the Stockholm archipelago and that the intelligence operation, as military officials had insisted on calling it, would be coming to an end.
It s a frustrating end to what has been a fascinating story.
During the last week, Swedish vessels have searched in futility for a Russian submarine while sightings of the submarine have streamed in from the public.
According to the Swedish military, there have been five credible sightings, all made by the public.
It is all but certain that Swedish military intelligence have made their own observations, but officials have so far made no public comments about what Swedish sonar and other sensors have picked up underwater.
In announcing the search s end, however, Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said that the military had ruled out the presence of a large, more ordinary-sized submarine.
The vessel, he said, had been spotted in area too shallow for a larger vessel to operate in, indicating that the submarine in question is of a smaller variety.
Grenstad said .
In launching the operation, the Swedish military said that its primary goal was to determine what had violated the country s territorial waters.
Its objective was not to destroy its opponent -- though commanders said their ships were authorized to use lethal force if necessary -- but to learn more about it.
Because they were operating in a highly populated and heavily trafficked area, the Swedish military conducted the operation with a remarkable degree of transparency.
In carrying out that operation, the military has, at least according to its statements, been heavily reliant on the public s help.
What evidence the Swedish military has collected on the submarine remains unknown, but it is all but certain that its military intelligence units know more than Grenstad is publicly letting on.
On Friday, he said that Swedish forces had been able to follow the mystery vessel  through the public s and our own observations,  one of his most concrete comments to date about whether Swedish defense systems have spotted the sub.
Regardless, it s an anticlimactic end to what has been a captivating and often bizarre story.
A fishing pensioner was confused for a Russian spy.
The commander of the Swedish military called the incursion  fucked up.  And the country s decommissioned anti-submarine warfare helicopters turned out to have been stashed away in a museum.
Then again, the operation s anticlimactic conclusion should come as no surprise.
During the 1980s, the Swedish navy engaged in a decade-long cat and mouse game with the Soviet military, which repeatedly sent underwater vessels and divers into Swedish waters.
Over the course of a decade and hundreds of Soviet missions, the Swedish military failed to surface or destroy a single one of those submarines.
The Swedish military captured just one Soviet submarine -- and only because it ran aground.
Having seen its resources and funding rapidly dwindle, it s no surprise that today s Swedish military failed in the same way as its better-equipped Cold War counterpart.
During the Cold War, especially in the 1980s, the Soviet navy carried out a series of aggressive submarine operations in Sweden s coastal waters.
Those operations primarily targeted Swedish military operations and appeared to focus on gathering intelligence about its naval and intelligence infrastructure.
The Soviets used a variety of tools to infiltrate Swedish defenses, including miniature submarines, combat divers, and tracked vehicles that could travel along the ocean floor.
The Soviet calculation appears to have been mostly military.
Then, as now, Sweden was ostensibly neutral, but its military posture remained friendly toward the West and NATO.
In the event of an all-out war between the Soviet Union and the West, Moscow s military planners doubted that Sweden would remain neutral.
As a result, Swedish naval installations along the Baltic became objects of enormous intelligence value.
Sweden tried and mostly failed to fend off these incursions.
The Swedish navy went so far as to use depth charges in its coastal waters, but the Soviet subs kept coming.
These incursions dropped off with the end of the Cold War, but with Russia s newly aggressive military posture toward the West, particularly against countries that during the Cold War served as a buffer between mother Russia and NATO, it should come as no surprise that Moscow s underwater adventures in the Stockholm archipelago have also made a comeback.
So don t expect the Swedes to be catching submarines any time soon.
When word spreads in Max Brooks s 2006 dystopian novel World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War that zombies are infesting the world, North Korea acts decisively, sealing its borders and hustling its people into mysterious bunkers.
Hyungchol Choi, the fictional deputy director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.
Now, as a far less apocalyptic virus completely unrelated to zombies spreads, North Korea is closing its borders.
On Thursday, Oct.
23, North Korea notified foreign tour operators that visitors are now banned.
Simon Cockerell, managing director of the tour operator Koryo Tours, told USA Today.
It s so obvious that it shouldn t have to be said, but the current Ebola outbreak is not the zombie apocalypse.
In Brooks s novel, North Korea is protected from the zombies ravaging the planet because it can withdraw from the world.
About a month before zombies spread to South Korea, the North severs communication with the South, closes its borders, and seems to send its entire population underground.
It s unclear exactly what happens, but Choi thinks that the people of North Korea evacuate to subterranean complexes and probably stay safe from the plague as a result.
In the 2013 film, an ex-CIA operative claims North Korea survives by removing everyone s teeth.
It s unclear why Pyongyang has cut itself off from tourists and whether the ban includes foreign businesspeople and diplomats.
It s possible that North Korea truly fears the disease.
This is not the first time it has taken such action in apparent response to a public health emergency: When in 2003 the respiratory virus SARS hit Beijing, North Korea instituted a tourism travel ban that lasted for roughly four months.
Perhaps this time around Pyongyang wants an excuse to keep people away for the winter, when conditions in the impoverished nation are especially grim and heating is not widely available.
In World War Z, the reader never finds out what happened to North Korea.

Swedish armed forces involved in the search off Stockholm.
Hiding a submarine off the shores of a foreign capital might seem a tall order, especially when you have helicopters, ships and 200 troops on your trail.
But in a murky and distinctly cold war-reminiscent game of cat and mouse, that is exactly what the Swedish navy appear to suspect Russia of doing.
Sweden’s military has spent three days scouring the waters off Stockholm for what has so far been officially described only as “foreign underwater activity”.
However, intelligence briefings to local newspapers suggest a Russian submarine might have had mechanical problems while on a secret mission in the region.
In scenes reminiscent of the 1970s and 80s – when neutral Sweden regularly hunted for Soviet spy submarines in the Baltic Sea around the capital – 200 service personnel were mobilised along with helicopters, minesweepers and an anti-submarine corvette fitted with stealth-type anti-radar masking.
The operation began late on Friday following what Sweden’s armed forces said was a reliable tipoff about something in the Stockholm archipelago, which has 30,000 islands and rocky outcrops around which a submarine could lurk.
The officer leading the operation declined to give more details, saying only that there had been no armed contact.
We still consider the information we received as very trustworthy,” Captain Jonas Wikström told reporters.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper said it was believed the intruder was a Russian submarine or mini-submarine that may have been damaged.
It said the operation was launched on Friday after a sighting of a “human-made object” in the waters.
The day before, Swedish intelligence operators intercepted a radio conversation in Russian on a frequency usually reserved for emergencies, the paper said.
An amateur photo released by Swedish Defence shows a dark object in a white wake in the sea.
Another signal was intercepted on Friday night, but this time the content was encrypted.
However, the report said, Swedish intelligence was able to pinpoint the locations of the participants.
One was in the waters off Stockholm, while the other could be traced to Kaliningrad, the port that is the home of Russia’s Baltic Sea fleet.
The military sources would not confirm that a Russian craft was in distress, the Svenska Dagbladet reported, but it added that Russia does have mini-submarines based at Kaliningrad.
Defence analysts cited in other reports speculated that a submarine might have been replacing old spy equipment or monitoring a Swedish naval exercise.
Russia, for its part, has denied this, saying its submarines and ships are “fulfilling their tasks in the world’s oceans”.
Sweden is among a series of Nordic and Baltic nations on increased alert over growing tensions with Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.
In September two Russian Su-24 attack jets reportedly violated Swedish airspace over the Baltic, prompting Sweden’s air force to scramble its own fighters.
Last week Finland complained that the Russian navy had twice harassed one of its environmental research ships in international waters, ordering it to change course and later sending a helicopter and submarine to pass close by.
The submarine hunt is an early political test for Stefan Löfven, Sweden’s new prime minister, whose centre-left minority government took office this month.
Peter Hultqvist, the defence minister, told Svenska Dagbladet that the government hoped to be more open than its predecessor about military activity.
What’s been happening in the Baltic Sea, including airspace incursions, shows that we have a new, changed situation,” he said.

Details remain sketchy, but something is clearly afoot off the coast of Stockholm Sweden, where a large search and intelligence operation is underway involving ships, from small riverine craft to stealthy Visby Class Corvettes, aircraft and over 200 operators.
Something of great interest is under the water, and it may be a Russian submarine in trouble.
Swedish officials are referring to this flash search operation as a response to  foreign underwater activity.  Meanwhile, there were said to have been sightings of a strange object prowling the complex archipelago off the Swedish coast last Friday.
Around the same time, sources say that Sweden intercepted Russian radio traffic on a channel that is reserved for emergencies.
Then later, another transmission was said to have been intercepted, this time encrypted.
However, Swedish intelligence agencies were able to get a ballpark idea of where it was coming from and where the source on the other end s location wasâ€”which turned out to be off the Swedish coast near Stockholm and around Kaliningrad, the home of Russia s Baltic fleet.
Swedish military officials state an incredibly good source also passed them a tip that something was afoot in their littoral waters, which prompted the response that is now ongoing and increasing in the area.
Another part of these strange happenings on and below the Baltic Sea surrounds peculiar maneuvers made by a Russian operated, Liberian flagged tanker.
The tanker had been loitering for some time off the Swedish coast before it started doing circles not too far from where all this is going down.
Then, this weekend, it suddenly steamed off towards the east.
Some speculate the ship could be supporting a clandestine mission potentially having to do with the submarine in question.
Midget submarines, which are smaller than even the diminutive diesel-electric attack designs, can be deployed clandestinely in multiple ways.
They can even be transported, launched and recovered via the underside of a larger ship.
They are the ideal platform for short-range espionage missions, such as inserting personnel or planting listening devices in major waterways.
Russia has had a resurgent interest in these pint-sized submersibles and are said to have put an updated design into production in recent years.
Russian Submarine mishaps are not unheard of in the area, the famous  Whisky On The Rocks  incident of 1981 being the most notable, during which a geriatric Russian Whisky Class attack sub ran aground in Swedish waters.
It was an international incident that featured a nail-biting standoff loosely reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis, although not nearly as volatile in magnitude.
As for Russia s Baltic fleet submarine forces, they include a handful of diesel-electric Kilo Class subs, which are capable in littoral environments, and one very advanced Lada Class submarine.
The only one of its type and the most advanced diesel submarine in the entire Russian Navy, the Saint Petersburg features air-independent propulsion  AIP , allowing it to stay submerged for far longer than traditional diesel-electric submarines and is thought to be the quietest submarine in the entire Russian Navy.
She was officially declared fully operational this year.
This situation will be very interesting to see play out.
Considering how tense things have been with Russia, and how willing President Putin has been when it comes to rattling his saber , if indeed a Russian sub has become immobilized in Swedish territorial waters, there is a good bet such an event will only deepen the chasm that continues to grow between Europe and Russia.
We will keep you posted as the story develops.

Sweden believes a damaged Russian submarine is trapped in its waters close to the country s capital Stockholm, according to a report.
In echoes of the Cold War, Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet says officials have picked up a distress call from the submarine.
The first call was sent out on Thursday.
Hours later a foreign vessel was spotted breaking the surface just 50 miles from the Swedish capital.

The Swedish armed forces announced a large military operation around islands off Stockholm late Friday following reports of suspicious  foreign underwater activity .
STOCKHOLM, Oct 18  Reuters  - Sweden beefed up its military  presence in the Stockholm archipelago on Saturday to scour its  waters for  foreign underwater activity,  a mobilization of  Swedish ships, troops and helicopters unseen since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 30 miles  50 km  from  Stockholm began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final  years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly hunted suspected  Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
There is now increasing tension with Russia among the Nordic  and Baltic states - most of them European Union members - over  Moscow s involvement in the Ukraine crisis.
Finland last week  accused the Russian navy of interfering with a Finnish  environmental research vessel in international waters.
The Swedish military has said information about suspicious  activity came from a trustworthy source, without providing  details, and that more than 200 military personnel were involved  in the search.
The Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, citing unidentified  sources with knowledge of the hunt, said it began after a radio  transmission in Russian on an emergency frequency.
Further encrypted radio traffic from a point in the  archipelago and the enclave of Kaliningrad, home to the Russian  Baltic fleet s headquarters, was intercepted on Friday evening  after the Swedish search started, the newspaper said.
The Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that there were  no emergency situations in the Baltic involving its vessels.
Interfax news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying.
Countries in the Baltic Sea region have become increasingly  wary of Russia s military ambitions since Moscow annexed  Ukraine s Crimea region in March following the overthrow of  Kiev s pro-Moscow president by protesters.
Last month, Sweden said two Russian warplanes entered its  air space, calling the intrusion a  serious violation  and  sending a protest to Moscow s ambassador in the Nordic  country.
Ships, helicopters and troops from an amphibious unit as  well as the home guard combed the search area in Stockholm s  archipelago.
The forces include HMS Visby, a corvette that has  stealth technology and equipment for anti-submarine warfare.
The Swedish military said on Friday there had been no armed  intervention and declined to comment on who might be responsible  for the suspicious activity, or whether the report had been  about a submarine.
Captain Jonas Wikstrom, head of operations for the  search, told reporters.
Should the search find proof of foreign military activity in  Swedish coastal waters it will represent the first real test of  Prime Minister Stefan Lofven s center-left minority government  only weeks after coming to office.
In 1981, a Soviet submarine known under its Swedish  designation U137 was stranded deep inside Swedish waters not far  from a major naval base in the neutral country, sparking intense  suspicion about the scale and motives of such incursions.

Swedish defence analysts cited by local media speculated that a foreign submarine may have been in the area to replace old spy equipment or to monitor a Swedish naval exercise.
Wikstroem declined to give details of the reinforcements to the  intelligence gathering  operation as they could provide information to  a potential opponent on how and where we are working  if there is ongoing  underwater activity .
Sweden s new Social Democrat Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist -- who took office just a fortnight ago -- refused to comment on the military operation but told the daily Svenska Dagbladet that his government would be more open about military incursions in the Baltic than its centre-right predecessor.
In recent months, Sweden has seen an uptick in Baltic Sea manoeuvres by the Russian air force.
In one incident in September, two SU-24 fighter-bombers allegedly entered Swedish airspace in what Foreign Minister Carl Bildt at the time called  the most serious aerial incursion by the Russians  in almost a decade.
During the 1980s and early 90s the then-neutral -- and now non-aligned -- Nordic country was regularly on alert following Russian submarine sightings, including one notable case in 1981 when a Soviet U-boat ran aground several miles from one of Sweden s largest naval base.

STOCKHOLM  AP  - Sweden s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.
In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.
While Sweden hasn t linked any country to the suspected intrusion - and Moscow suggested it was a Dutch sub - the incident sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region, where Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea and air in recent months.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter.
Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday, just 40 kilometers  25 miles  west of Stockholm amid the myriad of islands and skerries that stretch from the capital into the Baltic Sea.
On Sunday they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel - a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.
Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but stressed that unlike Sweden s submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn t using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.
Speculating on whether the suspected underwater intruder was linked to a mother ship, Swedish media zeroed in on an oil tanker owned by Russian company Novoship, which had been circling near Swedish waters.
S.
Daily Svenska Dagbladet has reported that Swedish intelligence picked up distress signals suggesting a Russian mini-submarine had run into trouble in Swedish waters and could be damaged.
Countering such claims, a Russian Defense Ministry official quoted by the Tass news agency suggested that the search was triggered by a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week.
The unidentified official suggested Sweden should save  taxpayers  money  and ask the Netherlands for an explanation.
The Dutch navy, in turn, said that submarine left Sweden on Thursday and had been in Estonia since early Friday.
In Sweden, Armed Forces spokesman Philip Simon said the Dutch submarine was not what triggered the Swedish search.
In the final decade of the Cold War, Sweden launched a series of unsuccessful submarine hunts after a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off its southeastern coast in 1981.
The events in the past days have sparked alarm across the Baltic Sea in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - three small former Soviet republics already spooked by Russia s intervention in Ukraine.
Estonia stepped up surveillance of its territorial waters, with the border guard looking out for  potential anomalies,  spokesman Priit Parkna said.
Lithuanians were concerned over the safety of a floating natural gas import terminal currently being transported on the Baltic Sea to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda.
The terminal will be key to Lithuania s plans to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.
Meanwhile, Russian media suggested the Swedes were overreacting.
The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even speculated that the submarine hunt could be a ploy by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget, which has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War.
The official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all, noting the Swedes hadn t found anything.
The submarine scare in Sweden comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow s growing assertiveness in the Baltic Sea region.
Finland s Environment Institute said last week that Russian military ships had twice intercepted one of its research vessels in international waters.

Both Sweden and Finland, which are not NATO members, have reported airspace violations by Russian military aircraft in the past two months.
Even when they stay in international airspace, Russian aircraft are conducting more ambitious maneuvers than at any point since the end of the Cold War, Western analysts say.
During Easter last year, Russian warplanes exercising over the Baltic Sea appeared to simulate attacks on targets in Sweden, embarrassing the Swedish Air Force which didn t have any jets on standby.
Magnus Christiansson of the Swedish National Defense College.
NATO says Russian airborne military activity in the Baltic region so far this year is two-and-a-half times higher than last year, and the alliance has boosted its own air patrols over tiny members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
However, a submarine sneaking into another country s territorial waters would be much more serious than muscle-flexing maneuvers in the air, Christiansson said.

The Swedish military spent the past three days hunting for a Russian submarine in waters off the coast of Stockholm after they reportedly intercepted a distress signal indicating  foreign underwater activity,  but Russian authorities have denied any illegal breach of waters in the Baltic and said none of their subs were in the area.
Swedish intelligence officials first detected an emergency signal Thursday evening.
They believe it was emitted from an underwater craft experiencing mechanical problems, according to  Swedish media .
Fourteen hours later, a foreign vessel reportedly surfaced amid the scattered islands off the Swedish coastline, setting off a flurry of military activity Friday reminiscent of the Cold War exploits of the  80s, when neutral Sweden would regularly scan the archipelago for Soviet submarines.
Russian Interfax news agency quoted a spokesman for the Russian Defence Ministry as saying.
A report in Svenska Dagbladet speculated that a damaged submarine may have surfaced to receive help from a support vessel, possibly a Russian oil tanker that was reportedly seen circling the waters off Stockholm.
The tweet below purports to show the October movements of the tanker.
By Sunday, the hunt had grown to a large-scale counter-intelligence operation involving Swedish ships, helicopters, minesweepers, a stealth anti-sub corvette, and 200 troops scouring the area for any sign of the vessel s movements.
The head of the operation for the Swedish military said Friday that there had been no armed intervention, but they were confident about the tipoff and that military activity would continue as long as necessary.
Captain Jonas Wikstrom told reporters.
The suspicious activity could be the first real test for Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, whose center-left government came into office mere weeks ago.
The activity also comes amid an uptick in recent reports of Russian naval and air activity in the region.
Last week, Finland accused Moscow s navy of interfering with one of its environmental research vessel in international waters, while last month, Sweden protested Russia s  serious violation  of its airspace after it spotted two Russian warplanes flying over its territory.
The massive sweep for the underwater vessel comes in response to fears among Baltic and Nordic states of increased Russian intelligence and military activity in the area, in the wake of the ongoing Ukraine crisis that ignited earlier this year.
The head of the Swedish armed forces has warned that his country could use    force to bring a suspected Russian mini-submarine, which its navy has been    hunting for days, to the surface.
Battleships, minesweepers, helicopters and more than 200 troops have been    scouring an area around the Stockholm archipelago since Friday, following    reports of a  man-made object  in the water.
Supreme Commander General Sverker Goeranson said there was  probable    underwater activity  off the coast of Stockholm and he was ready to use     armed force  to bring the mystery vessel to the surface.
The Telegraph s Tom Parfitt sailed a nearby stretch of water in a privately    hired boat and saw the Swedish military corvette - the HMS Visby - as it    patrolled the Baltic Sea looking for signs of the myster vessel.
Swedish naval veteran-turned-photographer Fredrik Sandberg,who was also on    board the boat, described the Visby s capabilities.
It s not a beautiful boat, it has stealth techniques so it supposed to be    invisible for radar for example but inside the hidden doors there are    torpedoes and also robots.
Sweden closed off waters and airspace off Stockholm last night as they widen the hunt for a mystery vessel suspected to be a Russian submarine.
It follows confirmation that the military has made three sightings - two on Friday, and one on Sunday - of foreign undersea activity - during their now, four day hunt.
The public was warned to keep a safe distance of at least six miles from the search operation – despite Moscow’s denials that any of its forces were involved.
Stockholm extended the search area for the underwater intruder today from 30 miles to 45 miles southeast of the capital, while it also cordoned off airspace.
The Swedish Navy sealed off a channel between Nynashamn and the island of Nattaro south of the city, while a large number of military vessels and helicopters were reported to be moving southward.
It also said it had picked up three encrypted signals from a suspected vessel it believes to be Russian.
Rear Adm.
Meanwhile a mysterious man was seen with a backpack wading into the sea and is also being sought by forces.
One theory was that an experimental Russian mini-sub called the Triton NN had got into trouble on a spy mission in Swedish waters.
The Triton-NN - developed around six years ago - has been called ‘the synthesis of high-speed boat and underwater vehicle’.
It is a ‘submersible boat’ capable of landing personnel on enemy beaches or depositing divers in key locations.
Today was the fourth day of an operation to identify and impound an alleged foreign intruder in Swedish waters after ‘very credible sightings’ of an unknown object.
A Russian bid to blame a Dutch submarine for the reports was quickly dismissed.
Authorities today claimed the vessel was probably Dutch, with a military source saying,  in order to ease tensions in the Baltic sea and save the money of Swedish taxpayers, we would recommend to search for explanations from the Dutch navy .
Rear Adm.
The scenario is reminiscent of the Cold War when Sweden s armed forces routinely hunted for Soviet submarines.
He said the military was not on a  submarine hunt, using weapons to combat an opponent , and said at present the military was simply engaged in an intelligence operation.
Troops on the island of Korso were also searching for a mysterious man with a backpack, dressed in black.
Officially, Sweden has  not pointed at Russia,  he said.
WAS STRICKEN RUSSIAN SUB DROPPING BY TO PICK UP SPY?
There has been speculation in the Swedish media that the  foreign vessel  was in the waters to pick up a spy after an image  above  was shared online which appeared to show a man wading into the sea.
According to Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter the man, who was dressed in black and wearing a backpack, is being hunted by military intelligence and security services for wandering out into the waters.
A member of the public took the picture on Saturday and shared it on social media but the image has since been removed.
And Russia s military intervention in Ukraine this year has fuelled suspicion about its intentions towards other neighbouring states, notably in the Baltic.
The Swedish operation and the subsequent denial of involvement from Russia has raised concern in a country which is often slow to admit such problems.
Several blogs and online forums in Russia today expressed fears over the 175-metre long Dmitri Donskoi nuclear submarine, one of the largest in the world, even though reports from Stockholm specified a mini-sub.
Russian authorities were later criticised for refusing international assistance and for misleading the public about the pace of their failed rescue operation.
They talked down reports in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.
It reported that Sweden had begun a search after a distress signal in Russian was detected on an emergency frequency on Thursday evening.
The paper said another signal was intercepted on Friday night and Swedish intelligence was able to pinpoint the locations of the participants.
One was in the waters off Stockholm, while the other could be traced to Kaliningrad, the port that is the home of Russia s Baltic Sea fleet.
But, according to Marine Traffic, a website which monitors vessels in the Baltic Sea, it suddenly turned around and headed back towards Sweden.
It has been suggested that the tankers movements could be connected to the submarine search.
Late yesterday the Professor Logachev, a research vessel, was tracked heading towards Sweden from St Petersburg – with three Dutch warships following it.

A Russian submarine has reportedly traveled to within a stone’s throw to Stockholm, prompting an aggressive response from Sweden, including a mobilization of troops and ships.
It had been reported late this week that “foreign underwater activity” was taking place in the Stockholm archipelago, but the activity was not confirmed, and it was not officially linked to Russia.
But reports later on Saturday seemed to confirm that it was Russia.
Sources say that more than 200 Swedish military personnel have been involved in the search for the sub.
The search started when National Defense Radio Establishment reportedly detected radio communication in Russian, and the search narrowed the next day.
Friday night signal intelligence once again intercepted radio communication,” the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported.
This time it was encrypted but it was possible to determine the position of the transmitter and the receiver.
The operation comes as tensions between Nordic and Baltic states have grown following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its nuclear maneuvering.
Earlier this month, Russia moved more than 100 nuclear warheads into northern waters, and Barents Observer noted that most were headed to two Northern fleet submarines.
Those two alone can hold 192 warheads, but since the increase, according to the official figures, is 131 since last information exchange in March, the two submarines are likely not fully loaded,” the report noted.
Many believed the nuclear weapon build up was a sign of aggression from Russia.
There is no doubt that the long-lasting period of disarmament now has changed to rearmament,” said Kristian Åtland, Senior Research Fellow with the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment.
Last week, Finland also accused Russia of interfering with an environmental research vessel inside of international waters.
The Swedish government has not released an official statement about the Russian submarine near Stockholm.

Sweden beefed up its military presence in the Stockholm archipelago on Saturday to scour its waters for  foreign underwater activity,  a mobilization of Swedish ships, troops and helicopters unseen since the Cold War.
STOCKHOLM  Reuters  - Sweden released on Sunday a grainy photo of a mysterious vessel in Stockholm s archipelago, as the military hunted for a foreign submarine or divers in the country s biggest such mobilization since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 30 miles  50 km  from Stockholm began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly sought out suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
The military showed one picture of what appeared to be a craft surrounded by white ripples.
The witness who took the photograph said the vessel then submerged -- one of three sightings that the military said were credible reports.
The Swedish armed forces have consistently labeled the their hunt one of investigating  foreign underwater activity  but elaborated on what that might entail on Sunday.
Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad told a news conference.
Grenstad said the sightings had taken place in  an area that is of interest to a foreign power , but added he was not in a position to link the observed activity to any particular nation.
This does not belong to us.
It is a foreign vessel and we have no indications that there would be any civilians involved in underwater activity,” he said.
The incident comes amid rising tension with Russia among the Nordic and Baltic states -- most of them European Union members -- over Moscow s involvement in the Ukraine crisis.
Finland last week accused the Russian navy of interfering with a Finnish environmental research vessel in international waters.
Reported sightings of one man dressed in black wading through waters led to speculation of Russian special forces in the archipelago, normally a popular holiday destination consisting of thousands of small islands.
The Swedish military has said the initial information about suspicious underwater activity came from a trustworthy source, without providing details, and that more than 200 military personnel were involved in the search.
The Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the hunt, said it began after a radio transmission in Russian on an emergency frequency.
Further encrypted radio traffic from a point in the archipelago and the enclave of Kaliningrad, home to the Russian Baltic fleet s headquarters, was intercepted on Friday evening after the Swedish search started, the newspaper said.
Grenstad said the armed forces had not received any information about a distress signal.
The Russian Defence Ministry said on Sunday there were no emergencies in the Baltic involving its vessels.
Interfax news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying.
Countries in the Baltic Sea region have become increasingly wary of Russia s military ambitions since Moscow annexed Ukraine s Crimea region in March following the overthrow of Kiev s pro-Moscow president by protesters.
Last month, Sweden said two Russian warplanes entered its air space, calling the intrusion a  serious violation .
Should the present search find proof of foreign military activity in Swedish coastal waters it will represent the first real test of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven s center-left minority government less than three weeks after it took office.
In 1981, a Soviet submarine known under its Swedish designation U137 was stranded deep inside Swedish waters not far from a major naval base in the neutral country, sparking intense suspicion about the scale and motives of such incursions.

Russia may be heightening tension with Sweden after the country’s submarines are suspected of traveling into waters in the Stockholm Archipelago, the latest act of military provocation between Russian and Western countries.
This week, Sweden’s military deployed planes and ships after being alerted to “foreign underwater activity” off Stockholm.
Swedish military officials said information about the incursion came from a “credible source” and that the incident is under careful investigation.
We have support for the analysis work we are now carrying out in the area in the form of ships, planes and territorial army personnel.
The area is heavily trafficked, which is why it’s important for us to go public with information about what we’re doing,” said Jonas Wikström, commanding officer of the operation.
Officials did not provide specifics about the incident or name the country that made the threat, but Russia is strongly suspected.
In recent months, Sweden has seen an uptick in Baltic Sea manoeuvres by the Russian air force — including an incident in September when two SU24 fighter-bombers allegedly entered Swedish airspace in what then Foreign Minister Carl Bildt called “the most serious aerial incursion by the Russians” in almost a decade.
American officials have warned about the capabilities of Russian submarines.
Navy Vice Adm.
Michael Connor said that Russia remains capable of striking American military bases with its fleet of nuclear-armed submarines.
The Soviet Union devolved into Russia but they kept their nuclear capabilities,” Connor said.
They are now re-growing those capabilities and others.
Russia has also been blamed for a number of other acts of military provocation , including a separate incident in which airplanes flew so close to the borders of the United States and Canada that both nations were forced to scramble jets to chase away the Russian planes.
Besides, carriers are juicy targets for cruise missiles.
Here you have a link that is reported online from Stockholm archipelago, but they are talking swedish.
The hunt is still going on right now.
Sweden has been disqusing that we neeed to reinforce our defence, this is the proof that we need to do so.
It should be a pressconference at 17:00 swedish time today 18-10-2014.
And yes , we are apprehension that it is Russia behind this.
Who dosen t remember in 1981 outside Karlskrona when the russian submarine U-137  hit aground also called ”Whisky on the rocks”.
USA whine endlessly when they did ?
I am talking about Sweden, Sweden is not a member of NATO.

In October 1981, the Russian Submarine W-137 accidently navigated on an underwater rock about  2 km from the Swedish main Naval Base at Karlskrona.
The boat was stucked on the rock for nearly 10 days.
The Russian Navy sent a rescue task force to the site in Sweden; it was composed of  heavily armed destroyers and high sea tugs.
As a result of negotiations between the Kremlin and the Swedish Goverment,  the master on the Russian Submarine was taken ashore for a hearing.
Very little came out of it.
The submarine was released to the Russian.
The matter was first-page news and closely watched by CBS, BBC, ATV and others.
The name of the captain was: Captain  Third degree  Anatolij Michajlovitj Gusjtjins,  age 35 years.
The boat was of Russian W-class  Whisky  and carried nuclear weapons in the forward torpedo room.
Onboard was also another officer of higher rank, Lt Cmdr Avsukjevitj.
Baltic western waters.
The boat belonged to a Russian naval base in Leiepaja but Gusjtjins admitted that he lived with his family in Baltisjk  Kaliningrad .
On his return to Baltisjk,  Gusjtjins was said to have been lowered in rank but kept his employment in the Navy.
The Russians moved the base of Baltic and Atlantic fleet from Kronstadt to Köningsberg after WW2 and renamed the city to Kaliningrad.
The base inhabited about 50,000 naval personel and families and was a closed city during the cold war.
Today,  the former glittering captial of Prussia is a gost city where everything is gray.
Normal U-boat activities.
During the first 5 years, the detection of U-boat activities was of a normal character.
Following detection, the boat disappeared and nothing was heard from until a new detection was made and so on.
In that time it was difficult to determine the nationality because time in action was too short to record any propeller sound for further analysis.
About 1980, the pattern of intrusion changed.
The boat did not leave the scene after detection.
It stayed and played hide and seek with the Swedish defenders.
In 1980 the Swedish navy possessed no destroyers which could move at full speed with active and passive sonar engaged.
The new Swedish anti U-boat weapons where small patrol boats and helicopters.
They had to idle on site in order to listen for sound in the water and they were out manoeuvered by the Russian Submarines.
In one instance, a new Swedish Submarine was being tested for speed and sound.
The sub was in communication with a nearby helicopter equipped with sonar.
Suddenly the helicopter detected a second  return  from a submerged target.
Believing the equipment was malfunctioning, the Submarine was ordered to surface immediately.
Upon surfacing, an intruding huge submarine passed 20 cm under the keel of the Swedish sub, at about 20 knots!
The intruding Sub had followed the Swedish during the speed test and had not realised that the Swedish submarine had surfaced.
This particular incident caused a full alarm as the speed tests had taken place near the Stockholm Naval Base.
But the intruding submarine remained in Swedish waters for another two weeks.
On another occasion, small trawlers operating in southern Baltic waters near Gothenburg caught a  submarine in their net and were dragged backwards below surface by the Sub’s powerful engines.
After the war, the Soviets captured 4 modern German XXI snorkel U-boats.
Between 1951 and 1957,  the Soviets built 226 bad copies of the German XXI.
According to information gathered from Nato - there were 24 boats of W class  Whisky  still in service 1981 in the Soviet, Third World and other  Warsaw pact countries.
The boat was 76 m long 1030 Grt, and carried a 60 men crew.
5 knots submerged.
NATO considered the 1950 s Whisky as a bad copy of the German s 1940 s XXI !
Are we not in Poland?
The Captain of U-137 claimed that the gyro compass of the ship did not work properly which had lead the captain to believe he was navigating in waters off Stolpe Banks along the Polish coast and  that he was surprised to have found himself on a rock in the Swedish Naval station Karlskrona.
The submarine also carried a man with a considerably higher rank than the Captain and the man presented himself as passenger and navigation expert.
The political officer onboard also had his own version and told the Swedish commission that the U-boat thought they were navigating around the island of Bornholm in Denmark!
When the Swedish interrogating officer left the boat he stumbled over rolls of very well made and very detailed Russian charts covering the Navy Station in Karlskrona and the neighbouring  waters.
Just the right charts to have onboard when you are sailing in Poland!
HOW SERIOUS WAS THE INTRUSION?
After gounding the W-137 in Sweden the Captain wired a report to Baltisjk.
The Russians then sent a  Task Force consisting of 3 heavy oceangoing  tugs escorted by the heavy destroyer  Obraztsovyj  a  140 meter converted Kasjin Class with a crew of 320 men.
It was armed with SSN 2 C Styx Missiles, possessing a range of 80 km,  several 76 mm guns, torpedoes and various antiaircraft missiles rockets.
The  Obraztsovyj  sailed together with another destroyer of the Kildin class, similarly armed.
The Commander of the Task Force was Admiral A.
Kalinin with order to pass through the Swedish border, salvage the W-137 and tow it back to Batijsk.
W-137 had not sent any distress call and Sweden did not accepted the submarine s emergancy claim.
Sweden denied entry to the Kalinin s Task Force.
Kalinin and his ship continued on with full speed ahead toward the Swedish border.
The Swedish Prime Minister Torbjörn Fälldin order the Supreme Commander to  keep the border clean .
The costal artillery, with a newly installed Bofors Haubits 77 as well as the older 15 cm artillery were ordered to fire on any of the two destroyers  but not the tugs or salvage ship  who crossed the border without stopping.
Kalinin was only 1 mile off the border when he was informed that active Swedish target seeking radars were locked on his ship.
When a mere 60 secons away from the border he turned his ship portside together with the other destroyer - but the Submarine salvage craft continued on across the  border.
It was soon stopped by 3 Swedish torpedoboats of the Spica Class.
The central radar sight for coastal artillery could see, on their screen, two dots moving north easterly between the Russian U-boat salvage craft  and the Russian destroyers.
The Haubits 77 was locked in on the new targets and when the ships moved out of the foggy belt they were visually identified as two peacefull German merchant ships destined for Karlskrona with loads of grain.
The Germans had no idea what was going on.
Could that situation have developed into a state of war?
In any case, it certainly was not the right  time for human failure to have taken place.

Getting worthier not better.
One could have expected the Russians to cut down on their underwater activities after their  misfortune of Oct 1981.
But no way!
In early January of 1982,  a flotilla of foreign submarines were  detected.
All along the coast of Stockholm to the coast of Gothenburg.
For the following 2 - 3 years the Swedish Navy deployed all they had; Submarines, helicopters, robot cruisers, patrol- and torpedo boats in a desperate  hunt of the intruders.
One day,  the Navy let the press know that they had a midget sub trapped in the basin off Hårsfjärden.
They claimed that the Sound was closed with nets and activated mine lines and that there was no way the midget sub could escape.
Unfortunately, two weeks later, without any captured U-boat,  the Navy had to admit that the Midget Sub had somehow escaped.
New Prime Minister Olof Palme murdered on the streets of Stockholm.
Palme was fed up with the Submarine incidents and was planning to build up good relations with Russia on a nuclear free zone in the Baltic.
The Russians were also very interested to improve the relations with neutral Sweden which could then act as buffer to NATO.
Understandably, the Swedish Russian relations had become quite frosty following the W-137 affairs.
The Navy felt betrayed.
Three days before Palme´s visit to Moscow in 1987, you could see six well known faces of high ranking Navy officers on the Front Pages of daily papers with the headline PALME IS A TRAITOR.
Have you any thoughts on why the officers in the Navy do not trust the Prime Minister?
Two days later Mr Palme was shot dead - the murderer is still free despite  a reward on 50 million SEK.
The Swedish Television recently released a program of Palme and the murder plot.
It was aired in 3  parts and was extremely well done.
The conclusion was that the murder was set up and organised by a number of ex officers, some of them later serving as police officers in Stockholm.
The so-called police trail.
The intruders continue.
Even during the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union,  the Navy detected U-boats.
Never, ever,  had any Russian Submarine trespassed into Sweden - except for the W-137 who made errors in navigation and thought he was in Poland.
Following is a pictorial record of the incident.

What s This?
Swedish navy corvette HMS Visby searches for a submarine in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden, on Oct.
19.
The Swedish Navy is poking around the waters of the Stockholm archipelago after a mysterious submarine was sighted three times in the surrounding area over the past several days.
A four-day search has turned up nothing thus far, but some Swedes are directing serious side-eye at Russia, whose military aircraft have continually violated Swedish air sovereignty over the past several months.
In September, it prompted then-Swedish foreign minister to place a formal complaint with the nation s Russian embassy, a rare flare of anger in Swedish foreign policy.
Not us, says Russia.
A Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson has already pointed a finger at the Netherlands; a Dutch submarine was conducting annual exercises near Stockholm last week.
But that submarine left for Estonia on Thursday, before the other mystery vessel had been sighted.
In this amateur photo provided by Sweden s armed forces and distributed by the TT News Agency on Oct.
19, a partially submerged object is visible in the water at center, in the Stockholm archipelago, Sweden.
It is thought that this object could be the top of a submarine.
The Dutch have reportedly denied that their submarine is in Swedish territory.
Russia has a base in Kaliningrad , between Lithuania and Poland, which faces Sweden and supports several submarines, according to the BBC.
Soviet Union submarines caused alarm several times within Sweden during the 1980s after vessels entered Swedish waters.
Tensions in the Baltic region has increased as a result of months-long violent conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and escalated further after an Estonian intelligence officer was held by Russia in September, supposedly on suspicion of spying.
Swedish Navy minesweeper HMS Koster searches for a submarine in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden, on Oct.

Sweden expanded the search to include more territory on Monday, and the navy is using ships and helicopters to patrol the waters of the archipelago.
The nation s government also established a no-fly zone above the search area.
Yet assuming the sightings are real, the owner of the submarine likely did not get inside the Stockholm archipelago by accident.
The area consists of around 30,000 islands and is farily difficult to navigate.

Sweden calls off weeklong search for suspected submarine in Stockholm archipelago.

Sweden’s Armed Forces received reports of two further sightings as it continued to search for foreign vessels in waters near Stockholm amid media speculation a damaged Russian submarine was seeking to evade capture.
The most recent sightings bring the total to five as the army searches both on water and land “for something or someone,” Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad, the deputy chief of operations at the Swedish Armed Forces, said on Tuesday at a press conference in Stockholm.
While the army can’t confirm an intrusion, it is “very likely” that such an event took place, he said.
The events are “completely unacceptable,” he said.
The army has moved its operation into open water, which is an easier area to search than within the archipelago, said Grenstad.
Sweden has deployed more than 200 personnel on corvettes, minesweepers and helicopters to look for what it said on Oct.
19 appeared to be foreign activity below the sea surface.
The search has also been expanded to land, Grenstad said.
Newspaper Dagens Nyheter earlier reported that the army “has made contact” with something underwater.
Airspace above the area has been closed for civilian traffic.
While the military has declined to comment on the identity of the potential intruder, the events need to be put in perspective given that a few years ago the region was stabilizing, Supreme Commander Sverker Goeransson said today.
But in the last few years, not least in connection to Russian military reform and Russian leadership, this has changed and been very obvious during this current year,” he said after reporting to parliament.
A 27-year-old Swede who spotted and photographed the vessel, whose photo was later published by the Armed Forces, told newspaper Aftonbladet there could be no doubt it was a submarine.
The development is the latest to remind the region of Cold War operations.
Both neighboring Finland and Sweden have suffered airspace violations by Russian planes the past year.
The complaints were echoed by the Baltic nations which, unlike Sweden and Finland, are NATO members.
Svenska Dagbladet, another newspaper, over the weekend reported that the authorities had intercepted communications from a struggling Russian vessel.
Russia has denied any involvement.
Russia denies it has a vessel in the area.
Russia s official government newspaper said either Sweden s echo location equipment was faulty or  as the old saying goes, the eyes of fear see danger everywhere .
Swedish prime minister Stefan Loefven said the search was being extended southwards to the open sea about 70 kilometres south-east of Stockholm, and more military exercises were being carried out in the Baltic Sea.
Mr Loefven told a media conference in Helsinki.
As the search expanded, the military warned the public to keep a distance of at least 10 kilometres from the operation.
Since Sweden s defence forces received a tip-off about a  man-made object  on Friday, more than 200 men, several ships, minesweepers and helicopters have combed the sea around islands close to the Swedish capital.
Mr Loefven said.
On Sunday night the Swedish armed forces released a photo taken the same day of what it believed was a  foreign vessel  near islands about 50 kilometres east of the Swedish capital.
For many Swedes the sight of more than 200 members of the country s armed forces on the hunt for a suspected hostile vessel has been evoking a spooky sense of deja vu, because reported sightings of Russian submarines regularly sparked security alerts during the Cold War.
It s very, very weird.
There have been three reported sightings of the mystery vessel in recent days, but the chairman of the Swedish Defence Committee Allan Widman said so far conclusions could not be drawn.
The Swedish defence forces have got enough other indicators that they re not releasing to make them determined to make this very massive investment.
They re not chasing ghosts.
Then there has been a Russian ship lying just outside Swedish territorial waters for the duration of this crisis.
My conclusion from this is that it s probably a Russian mini-submarine - one or more.
There s roughly two motives we could find: one is that they re there to see what the Swedes have placed down there, so it s reconnaissance.
Mr Reis said a possible  Loch Ness monster  scenario was unlikely.
To my mind, that indicates that they are very sure about this.
They are professionals, they know what they re doing.

MOSCOW, October 18  RIA Novosti  - The Swedish Armed Forces have stepped up search efforts in the waters near the country’s capital after receiving “reliable reports” of foreign underwater activity in the area, chief of operations Jonas Wikstrom said Saturday.
We consider the information to be very reliable.
Therefore, we are increasing the number of units in the area,” Wikstrom told reporters Saturday evening.
This is intelligence work.
We are working to determine whether there is or has been foreign underwater activity in the area,” he stated, noting that the search will continue for “as long as it is needed”.
Answering journalists’ questions of whether the alleged underwater activity could have been carried out by Russian forces, Wikstrom stated that he would “absolutely not speculate” on this matter.
The Swedish Armed Forces first launched a major search mission off the coast of Stockholm on Friday after receiving information, reportedly from a civilian, about underwater activity in the region.

A distress signal in Russian preceded the submarine alert in the archipelago of Stockholm.
When the marine search operation started radio communication between a transmitter in the archipelago and a transmitter in Kaliningrad was detected.
This indicates that there could be a damaged russian submarine in Swedish waters.
A picture of the latest observation, taking place on Sunday.
Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet can reveal sensational information about what happened before and during the ongoing marine search operation in the archipelago of Stockholm, where the Swedish Armed Forces – in their own words – are searching for  suspected foreign activity under water .
In the official version the operation started due to the reports from a  credible source  that had seen a suspicious object on friday.
But what has not been revealed is that the National Defence Radio Establishment   Försvarets radioanstalt , FRA  detected radio communication in Russian a day before the operation started.
It was transmitted on a special frequence, used by Russia in emergency situations.
About 14 hours later, Friday the 17th october around noon, the underwater vehicle was detected and the search operation begun.
Friday night signal intelligence once again intercepted radio communication.
This time it was encrypted but it was possible to determine the position of the transmitter and the receiver.
The transmitter was situated somewhere in Kanholmsfjärden in the archipelago of Stockholm, and the receiver was situated in Kaliningrad, Russia.
This information has been confirmed by several persons with knowledge about the ongoing search operation, altough they can t confirm that there is a damaged submarine in Swedish waters.
We are now focusing on determining if there is ongoing foreign underwater activity or not, one of the sources tells Svenska Dagbladet.
The swedish armed forces said Sunday – after a couple of days of almost complete silecence about the operation – that they now see it as  very likely  that foreign activity under water is taking place in the archipelago of Stockholm.
On a press conference they said they have recieved three testimonys since Friday from eyewitnesses that have made similar observations of something showing at the surface in three different places in the archipelago.
They also showed a picture of the latest observation, taking place on Sunday, that shows a black object coming up from the water – altough far away from where the picture is taken.
At the same press conference the Swedish armed forces rejected that they had recieved information about any emergency call in Russian.
But they did not want to comment on the information about radio communication between Kanholmsfjärden and Kaliningrad.
Det var som att sätta sig i ett stort badkar”.
Stockholm  AFP  - The Swedish armed forces stepped up a military operation off the coast of Stockholm on Saturday where they were investigating a report of  foreign underwater activity .
More than 200 men, Swedish stealth ships, mineswmaginary pictureeepers and helicopters have been searching an area of the Baltic Sea about 50 kilometres  30 miles  east of the Swedish capital since Friday evening, following a tip-off from what the military called a  credible source .
Commander Jonas Wikstroem told reporters at a press conference in Stockholm.
What is the purpose ?
Didn t they just find an alleged USO in this area that is awaiting proper funding to extract?
Not sure, it was the on TV recently, round disk like thing at the ocean floor with crash drag marks along with another a short distance away.
Might be a submarine detection relic used in WW2 by the allies.
Interesting though, with other recent events happening also.
STOCKHOLM  Reuters  – Sweden boosted its military presence in Stockholm’s archipelago on Saturday to scour its waters for “foreign underwater activity” in a mobilization of ships, troops and helicopters unseen since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 31 miles  50 km  from Stockholm began on Friday and brought back vivid memories of the final years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly hunted suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
The operation comes amid increasing tension with Russia among the Nordic and Baltic statesover the Ukraine crisis.
Finland last week accused the Russian navy of interfering with a Finnish environmental research vessel in international waters.
The Swedish military has said information about suspicious activity came from a trustworthy source, without providing details, and that more than 200 military personnel were involved in the search.
Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the search, said the military operation came after a radio transmission in Russian on an emergency frequency.
Further encrypted radio traffic from a point in the archipelago and the enclave of Kaliningrad, home to the Russian Baltic fleet’s headquarters, was intercepted on Friday evening after the Swedish search started, the newspaper said.
Swedish newspaper say there have been radio traffic from whatever it is to Kaliningrad.
So it seem to be Russian.
As long as Sweden stays neutral I am not that worried.
There s no way that it s a boomer.
They go deep and hide, not sneak into someone s territorial waters.
You NEVER put a boomer that close to someone, you put them far out to sea with lots of room to disappear.
My bet is on either an Akula II, or a Kilo, probably the latter.
Diesel-electric boats are notoriously hard to find, and one of the Kilos reportedly has pumpjets, which would make it even quieter.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 31 miles  50 km  from Stockholm began on Friday and brought back vivid memories of the final years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly hunted suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
Sweden was also hunting Nato subs inside Swedish waters during the cold war even if it was not always reported that UK, US and Germany that was trespassing.
They figure the Russian sub is damaged.
This information has been confirmed by several persons with knowledge about the ongoing search operation, altough they can t confirm that there is a damaged submarine in Swedish waters.

CORRECTS YEAR - The Swedish minesweeper HMS Kullen under way in Namdo Bay, Sweden, Tuesday, Oct.
21, 2014 on their fifth day of searching for a suspected foreign vessel in the Stockholm archipelago.
The navy has demanded a 1000-meter,  yard  no-go radius around naval vessels taking part in the current operation.
STOCKHOLM –  Swedish authorities say they have called off their weeklong search for a suspected submarine in the Stockholm archipelago.
Military authorities said Friday that they have ordered naval and amphibious forces to end their hunt for the submarine, though some ground forces will remain involved.
Sweden s military launched its biggest anti-submarine operation since the twilight of the Soviet Union last Friday after receiving credible reports of foreign underwater activity in the archipelago that extends from the capital, Stockholm, into the Baltic Sea.
Military officials haven t blamed any country for the suspected intrusion, though most Swedish defense analysts say Russia would be a likely culprit.
BREAKING: Sweden s military has deployed planes and ships in the Stockholm Archipelago against what it says is a threat from foreign submarines in the Stockholm Archipelago.
Swedens Armed Forces say the alert is in response to  foreign underwater activity  in the Stockholm Archipelago.
Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist said he was receiving regular updates from the Armed Forces, who had informed him the operation was  necessary and well-founded .
TT news agency quoted him as saying.
Neither Hultqvist not Foreign Minister Margot Walström would comment on the nature of the information they had received from the military.
In a statement on their website, the Armed Forces say a credible source has provided the information behind the announcement.
A counter-intelligence operation is now underway in the area.
False alarm?
Recently Russian planes  fighters and surveillance aircraft  have been violating Swedish airspace.
I doubt Sweden is willing to end its two hundred years of peace over a single submarine.
Even if it is a sub, the Swedish military is not capable of doing anything anyway, even if they wanted to.
It will trigger a diplomatic crisis though.
I hope we get some great 80 s music.

It was carrying nuclear weapons.

Perfect.
There have been rumours that Putin expects a general European war of some sort to happen.
In that light, all of these intrusions make sense in that Russia is testing the response capabilities of various European nations as preparation for that war.
Of course we aren t expecting a war, and we certainly don t want one.
So to us all of these intrusions just seem ridiculous, and give the impression that Russia is preparing to attack, when they could just as well be preparing to defend.
Not to excuse the Russians for escalating tensions.

Norway is apparently going to get military reforms because of the increasing Russian activity, or it was just a sensationalist headline in an otherwise serious news paper, but the reform thing is happening for real.
Edit: In case someone don t know Norway and Sweden share a pretty long border.

Pretty obvious it s the Ruskies.
Of course the Socialdemocrats and their weak-sauce Environmentalists are all about ignoring the threat to the east and cutting down funding to the military in order to fund their idealistic nonsense.
Probably a ruse  eh?
No, I don t think this is it at all, but I m pretty sure some people will go there.
If this is really happening, FUCK OFF Russia.
We haven t done shit to you, stop acting like you re preparing to invade us.
As long as they stay in international waters they are technically free to navigate where they want.
As long as they stay in international waters they are technically free to navigate where they want.
Both incident were breaches of Swedish territory.
Hence why they re  incidents  and not just  ... .
As long as they stay in international waters they are technically free to navigate where they want.
The area they are searching isn t international waters though, it s in an archipelago about 40-50 miles inside Sweden s territory?
There s a lot of controversy about that, there were many submarine hunts but it s not confirmed they were USSR subs, some people claim they were NATO subs.
There was one USSR sub that ran aground though, U137.
I doubt Sweden is willing to end its two hundred years of peace over a single submarine.
Maybe, but Russia could decide for them.
Now what?
The area they are searching isn t international waters though, it s in an archipelago about 40-50 miles inside Sweden s territory?
Oh, it s much closer than that.
Try 30 miles from Stockholm.
It s basically the Swedish version of Russian subs in Chesapeake Bay.
Not this time.
MoD s confirmed it s the real deal.

Swedish corvette HMS Visby patrols the Stockholm Archipelago October 19 2014, searching for what the military says is a foreign threat in the waters.
A large military operation is under way in waters off Stockholm to sweep for a “foreign underwater activity” widely speculated to be a damaged Russian submarine, in what could be the gravest violation of Sweden’s maritime sovereignty since the Cold War.
The intelligence operation, involving helicopters, minesweepers, corvettes, fast-attack crafts, a submarine and 200 service personnel, started on Friday, after a “man-made device” was sighted deep inside the Stockholm archipelago and encrypted radio communication was intercepted between that position and Kaliningrad — the base of Russia’s Baltic Sea fleet.
Sweden’s military said Sunday it had made a total of three credible sightings within two days and released an image taken by a passerby showing a partially submerged object, but has yet to comment on whether it is a Russian submarine.
A suspicious black-clad man was also photographed wading in the waters outside the island of Sandön.
On Oct.
2, a navy ship collided with an object in the vicinity, which some believe could have been a submersible that has since fallen into distress.
Intelligence expert Joakim von Braun told the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter that the spotted object could be an advanced mini submarine of the model Triton-NN, and that the stranded crew could have hidden themselves on one of the many nearby islands while waiting to be picked up.
It could very well be the case that a Swedish sleeper agent is activated since the embassy personnel is too monitored to carry out such a mission,” he said.
Russia has recently been increasingly bullish against its Baltic and Nordic neighbors, prompting some to speculate that they are trying to discourage these countries from deeper cooperation with NATO.
In September, Russian fighter jets reportedly violated Swedish airspace, and Finland claims that the Russian navy harassed one of its environmental research ships in international waters last week.
However, maritime incursions have not been apparent since the 1980s, when Sweden’s military was frequently scrambled to investigate, and sometimes hunt, suspected Russian submarines in its waters.
International law allows warships to cross maritime borders, while submarines may only do so while surfaced unless previous notification has been given.
Tomas Ries, a researcher at the Swedish National Defense College, says it would be a serious violation if a Russian submarine were located this far into Swedish waters.
When the Russians violate airspace it’s a political signal, when they practice strategic bomb attacks it’s a political signal,” he told the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet.
But if they are going on like this in Swedish waters it suggests that they are preparing something,” he adds, suggesting perhaps mines or reconnaissance equipment.
An unnamed Kremlin military source apparently denied that the mystery craft was Russian when speaking to state-backed news agency RT.
No extraordinary, let alone emergency situations have happened to Russian military vessels,” said the source.
The Swedish navy has stepped up its search in the waters off Stockholm amid suspicions that a Russian submarine might be in trouble there.
The military has asked civilian vessels to evacuate the area between Nattaro island and Danziger Gatt.
A Swedish source told the BBC an underwater vessel was spotted in waters about 25km  16 miles  from Stockholm.
Russia s defence ministry denied any  irregular situation  involving its ships.
It said a Dutch submarine might have triggered Sweden s alert after carrying out exercises in the area.
However, this theory has been dismissed by the Dutch defence ministry.
The Hague told the BBC.
It is the fourth day of the search, involving ships and helicopters.
The Swedish military earlier said it was investigating three credible sightings of  foreign underwater activity .
It denied looking for a submarine, and said that it was conducting an intelligence operation.
It also released a grainy photograph showing an object in the sea near Stockholm, although it was not clear what the object was.
The Swedish navy has asked all vessels to stay at least 10km away from military vessels.
A Swedish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that air space around the search area had been closed off.
He said he doubted the incident could have been a navigating error, as the Stockholm archipelago is a difficult area to navigate.
Sweden was keeping an open mind about which country was behind the incident, the official said, adding that there had been a similar pattern of incidents in the past.
Soviet submarine sightings during the Cold War caused security alerts in Sweden in the 1980s.
Swedish radio says the search area has expanded to include more islands out into the Baltic, further away from Stockholm.
Swedish news website The Local says vessels and troops have been deployed from Moeja, north of Stockholm, to Ornoe, south of the capital, using sensors in an operation  continuing day and night .
A local newspaper said Sweden had intercepted a distress signal in Russian.
It is reported to be Sweden s biggest military mobilisation since the Cold War, the BBC s World Affairs Correspondent Richard Galpin reports.
Whatever is lurking under the waters of the Stockholm archipelago, it is raising tensions in what is already a nervous region after Russian troops moved into parts of Ukraine earlier this year, our correspondent adds.
Russia has several submarines based in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave bordered by Poland and Lithuania and facing out to Sweden, as well as a much bigger force near Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula.
Last month, another Swedish newspaper, Expressen, reported an incursion by two Russian Sukhoi Su-24 fighter bombers into national airspace.
Sweden scrambled jets to see them off, it said.

Sweden called off a week-long hunt for a suspected foreign vessel in the Stockholm archipelago, ending its biggest naval mobilization since the Cold War .
The search was stopped after failing to find clear evidence, Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad, deputy chief of operations at the Swedish Armed Forces, said today at a press conference in Stockholm.
Some ground units remain “with specific tasks,” he said.
The assessment is that the “unit or units” being tracked “have left the area,” Grenstad said.
The military has “with confidence” excluded that it was a “conventional submarine” because of the water depth where observations were made and will study the sightings and underwater recordings further, he said.
It is like finding a needle in a haystack, but you always have to try,” he said in an interview after the briefing.
As local media speculated the vessel was a damaged Russian submarine, the navy has refrained from commenting on its origins.
The military said it received five credible reports of sightings since the chase began last Friday.
Russia has denied any involvement and today said that Sweden’s actions had inflamed tensions across the Baltic Sea region.
Such unjustified actions of the Swedish Defense Ministry backed by Cold War rhetoric today only exacerbates tension,” Russian Major General Igor Konashenkov said, according to news agency Tass.
Sweden’s mobilization was the largest since the Cold War days when it frequently conducted submarine hunts along its Baltic Sea coast and comes amid a backdrop of rising tensions between Europe and Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.
In 1981, the Soviet submarine U-137 ran aground near the naval base of Karlskrona in southern Sweden, stoking a decade of submarine alarms until the Soviet Union ’s collapse.
We will assert our territorial integrity,” Grenstad said in the interview.
Unlike the 1980s and 1990s, the military is now seeking to be as transparent as possible, he said.
It will come with proposals on how preparedness can be increased, he said.
Press spacebar to pause and continue.

Sweden has boosted its military presence in Stockholm s archipelago on Saturday to search its waters for  foreign underwater activity  in a mobilisation of ships, troops and helicopters unseen since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 31 miles  50 km  from Stockholm began on Friday, bringing back memories of the final years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly hunted alleged submarines along its coasts with depth charges.
The operation comes amid increasing tension with Russia among the Nordic and Baltic states over the Ukraine crisis.
Finland last week accused the Russian navy of interfering with a Finnish environmental research vessel in international waters.

The Netherlands has denied a Russian claim that a mysterious “foreign vessel” photographed in waters off Sweden could be Dutch.
The Swedish military says it made three sightings of  foreign undersea activity  in the past few days, amid media reports of a suspected Russian intrusion in the area.
Swedish Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said the armed forces were carrying out an intelligence operation to observe underwater activity in the Stockholm archipelago area, but declined to give details.
Speaking to reporters, he said he would not speculate about the sightings.
It could be a submarine, or a smaller submarine.
It could be a diver using some form of moped-like underwater vehicle and it could be divers who do not have any business on our territory.
That is where I think you have the span of what could be foreign underwater activity,   said Grenstad.
The Russian defense ministry said earlier Monday the vessel could be a Dutch submarine, the  Bruinvis,  which had participated in military exercises off the coast of Sweden.
But the Dutch defense ministry replied the submarine was no longer in the area when the mystery vessel was sighted.
The Swedish armed forces published a picture taken by an amateur photographer of a submerged object in the waters near Stockholm.

Ukrainian and Russian officials will meet again next week in an effort to settle their dispute over natural gas supplies that threatens to leave Ukraine short of heating fuel for the coming winter.
VOA’s Al Pessin reports from London the dispute is complex, and has both economic and geopolitical dimensions.

Sweden has released a photo of an unknown vessel in Stockholm s archipelago.
Stockholm: Sweden has released a grainy photo of a mysterious vessel in Stockholm s archipelago, as the military hunted for a foreign submarine or divers in the country s biggest such mobilisation since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 50 kilometres from Stockholm began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly sought out suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
The military showed one picture of what appeared to be a craft surrounded by white ripples.
Swedish Navy Corvette HMS Visby patrols the Stockholm archipelago.
The witness who took the photograph said the vessel then submerged.
It was one of three sightings that the military said were credible reports.
The Swedish armed forces have consistently labelled  their hunt as one of investigating  foreign underwater activity  .
Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said on Sunday.
He said the sightings were  in  an area that is of interest to a foreign power , but added he was not in a position to link the  activity to any particular nation.
This does not belong to us.
The incident comes amid rising tension with Russia among the Nordic and Baltic states – most of them European Union members – over Moscow s involvement in the Ukraine crisis.
Finland last week accused the Russian Navy of interfering with a Finnish environmental research vessel in international waters.
Reported sightings of a man dressed in black wading through waters led to speculation of Russian special forces in the archipelago, normally a popular holiday destination consisting of thousands of small islands.
The Swedish military has said the initial information about suspicious underwater activity came from a trustworthy source, without providing details, and that more than 200 military personnel were involved in the search.
Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the hunt, said it began after a radio transmission in Russian on an emergency frequency.
Further encrypted radio traffic from a point in the archipelago and the enclave of Kaliningrad, home to the Russian Baltic fleet s headquarters, was intercepted on Friday evening after the Swedish search started, the newspaper said.
The Russian Defence Ministry said on Sunday there were no emergencies in the Baltic involving its vessels.
Interfax news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying.
Teenager Abdullah Elmir from south west Sydney has reportedly appeared in a new video for the Islamic State terror group.

Russia  s territorial expansion plans have just reached Sweden.
Reports have circulated that the Swedish military spotted a Russia n submarine just 31 miles from the Swedish capital.
Countries around the Baltic Sea all suddenly roused up and became edgy.
The Swedish minesweeper HMS Kullen and a guard boat are seen in the search for suspected  foreign underwater activity  at Namdo Bay, Stockholm October 21, 2014.
Sweden s military is working on two new observations that could be evidence of suspected  foreign underwater activity  near the country s capital, a senior naval officer said on Tuesday.
Swedish forces have been scouring the sea off Stockholm since Friday, after what the military called three credible reports of activity by foreign submarines or divers using an underwater vehicle.
Civilian vessels had been ordered by the federal government to stay clear out of the waters of the Stockholm archipelago.
A no-fly zone has likewise been implemented as the Swedish military continue to scour from both air and water the mysterious  foreign  submarine which is believed to be of Russia ownership.
General Sverker Goeranson, supreme commander of Sweden s armed forces, said he will use  armed force, if necessary  just to bring up to the surface waters the mysterious vessel.
The search for the alleged Russian submarine started on Friday, kicked off when Swedish intelligence authorities reported picking up an emergency radio call in Russian, the English-language Web site The Local reported, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet .
It was a distress call being sent to Kaliningrad, 330 miles  530 kilometres  south of Stockholm on the Baltic s southern shore, The Local report said.
Swedish military up to now has yet to find any trace of the mysterious vessel.
The Russian submarine s alleged incursion into Swedish waters has alarmed the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
These three small nations used to be part of the former Soviet republic.
Although the Swedes have wondered about the presence of the military vessel in their waters, they believed there are at least three reasons for such.
Johan Wiktorin of the Swedish Royal Academy of War Sciences told The Local that the Russians could be mapping the waters to navigate them in the event of hostilities.
A second notion was they could be installing equipment or sensors to observe how the Swedish units in that area move.
The Local likewise reported the presence of the NS Concord, a Russian-owned oil tanker, which had been observed circling in international waters near Stockholm.
The ship s movements so far in October was seen in a Twitter post below.

Wikstroem said, adding that no weapons had been used in the current operation.
From Reuters:  Captain Jonas Wikstrom told a news conference around 200 military staff are involved in the current intelligence operation.

Bringing back memories of the Cold War, Sweden is reportedly searching for a suspected Russian submarine in the waters east of Stockholm.
The Swedish military has ramped up search efforts for a suspected Russian submarine off the coast of the capital of Stockholm, military officials announced Saturday.
Wikstroem would not confirm or deny that the search was for a distressed Russian submarine.
Since Friday, over 200 men, stealth ships, helicopters and minesweepers have been searching a stretch of the Baltic Sea about 50 kilometers east of the Swedish capital, although the military has not announced the results of the search thus far.
Sweden has not seen a mobilization of this sort since the Cold War.
Wikstroem said.
Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet reported that the military intercepted a distress call in Russian intended for a port in the city of Kaliningrad.
Defense analysts have told local media that it is possible a foreign submarine may have been in the area to replace spy equipment, or monitor a Swedish naval exercise.
The operation is taking place amid rising fears in the Baltic countries over the Ukraine crisis and concerns about potential renewed Russian territorial aggrandizement.
Last week Finland accused the Russian navy of interfering with one of its research vessels in international waters.
Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist told the Svenska Dagbladet.
Sweden, which sought to destroy alleged Russian submarines near the end of the Cold War, has also been monitoring an increased number of Russian air force maneuvers over the Baltic Sea.
Last month two Russian warplanes allegedly entered Swedish airspace.
Foreign Minister Carl Bildt called it  the most serious aerial incursion by the Russians  in nearly 10 years.
STOCKHOLM — Sweden’s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.
In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.
Although Sweden has not linked any country to the suspected intrusion, the incident sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region, where Russian forces have been accused of border violations on land, sea and air in recent months.
Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday, just 25 miles west of Stockholm.
On Sunday, they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel — a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.
Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said that more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but he stressed that, unlike Sweden’s submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn’t using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.
Speculating on whether the suspected underwater intruder was linked to a mother ship, Swedish media zeroed in on an oil tanker owned by the Russian company Novoship, which had been circling near Swedish waters.
On Monday, Novoship President Yuri Tsvetkov said that he was “flattered” by the attention but that the ship was charted for transporting oil from Russia to the United States and was drifting on standby awaiting loading orders.
The daily Svenska Dagbladet has reported that Swedish intelligence picked up distress signals suggesting a Russian mini-submarine had run into trouble in Swedish waters.
Countering such claims, a Russian Defense Ministry official quoted by the Tass news agency suggested that the search was triggered by a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week.
The Dutch navy, in turn, said that submarine left Sweden on Thursday and had been in Estonia since Friday.
In the final decade of the Cold War, Sweden launched unsuccessful submarine hunts after a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off its southeastern coast in 1981.
The events in the past days have sparked alarm across the Baltic Sea in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — three former Soviet republics already spooked by Russia’s intervention in Ukraine.
Estonia stepped up surveillance of its territorial waters.
Lithuanians were concerned about the safety of a floating natural gas import terminal being transported on the Baltic Sea to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda.
Meanwhile, Russian media suggested that the Swedes were overreacting.
The official Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper questioned whether there was any submarine, noting that the Swedes hadn’t found anything.
The submarine scare comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow’s growing regional assertiveness.
The Finnish Environment Institute said last week that Russian military ships had twice intercepted one of its research vessels in international waters.
On Sept.
5, an Estonian security service officer was detained on the Russian border — Estonia and Russia disagree on which side of it — and is still in custody in Moscow.
Sweden and Finland, which are not NATO members, have reported airspace violations by Russian military aircraft in the past two months.

As a former sonar tech in the  US  Navy, the Russians do this a lot.
Usually they test how close they can get until detected.
Quite a surprise a couple years back when a pair of Russian subs were tracked along the East Coast of the US, but were previously undetected by land listening stations.
Usually we were able to hear them leaving port in Russia with underwater arrays in place.
Edit: Ive received a couple messages from spaztards freaking out about  the posting of classified material  with this post and others ITT.
Wanted to clarify that while yes, the Specific frequencies that correlate to a known type of contact are in fact classified Secret, the methods used by the US or any other Navy to track an underwater contact, is a quick Google search away, and is not classified.
I have not posted any frequency on here or ITT, so put your pitchforks away creepers.
I do with this.
Oh shit, my bad.
How bout this.
As a former sonar tech for the  US  Navy, i ain t never seen no red submarine, other than in that one movie with that one feller.
I say we shoot it outta the sky!
If that is interesting to you I recommend reading up on Operation Drumbeat.
During WW2 U-Boats stalked the US east coast within sight of sunbathers in some cases.
Most people don t realize how close WW2 came to our doorstep.
Edit: Also  Iron Coffins  is the journal of a U-Boat captain who served from the  Happy Times  of Operation Drumbeat all the way to Germanys defeat.
In October 1981, the Soviet submarine S-363 accidentally hit an underwater rock about 2 km from the main Swedish naval base at Karlskrona, surfacing within Swedish waters.
The boat s presence coincided with a Swedish naval exercise, testing new equipment, in the area during the same days.
Swedish naval forces reacted to the breach of neutrality by sending an unarmed naval officer aboard the boat to meet the captain and demand an explanation.
So your  completely untrue  assessment was indeed hypocrisy.
Hooray absolutes!
They are not all conscripts.
They do not crew their billion-dollar nuclear submarines entirely with gaggles of Muscovites picked at random, and they certainly don t put them under the command of fools.
I don t doubt that.
They would have to be insane to let anyone but a very skilled and well trained captain to command a multi-billion dollar vessel like that.
Same goes for the crew in general, albeit to a lesser extent.
My point is that OP was right about the conscripts.
You re right about the training.
It s alllllll part of the game, people.
I did what you did but from the aviation side.
We will locate your faintest whispers, target your slightest movements, gaze upon the heat of your body.
If you hit it, I d guess pieces go just about everywhere.
I seriously doubt that this is actually the case in the article, but conceivably, one could use a high, high definition form of sonar  like inside a lab, close range, not field use  to detect some forms of coloration.
Objects can be colored, although they are rarely colored this way, by perforation with holes of certain sizes, related to the wavelength of the desired color.
Since this is an alteration of the physical shape, it could actually be detected with a sonar of sufficiently insanely good definition.
Again, ~100% not the case here, but IMO, an interesting tangentially related scientific side note.

Sweden Expands Hunt for Suspected Russian Sub!
Sweden suspects Russian submarine is hiding in Baltic Sea.
NEW SUBMARINE!

19 2014.
HELSINKI - The Swedish military said Sunday it had made three credible sightings of foreign undersea activity in its waters during the past few days amid reports of a suspected Russian intrusion in the area.
Rear Adm.
Anders Grenstad said the armed forces had observed the activity in the Stockholm archipelago and nearby coastal area, but declined to give details of an operation reminiscent of the Cold War, when Sweden s armed forces routinely hunted for Soviet submarines in its waters.
The armed forces published a photograph taken on Sunday by a passerby showing a partially submerged object in the water from a distance, but it was unclear what kind of vessel was in question.
The military said the intelligence operation, involving a few hundred people, began Friday.
Grenstad said it had no information about any emergency messages suggesting a Russian mini-submarine had run into trouble in Swedish waters and could be damaged, as reported by the Svenska Dagbladet daily.
The Defense Ministry in Moscow said its submarines and ships have been  fulfilling their tasks in the world s oceans,  according to plan, Russian news agencies reported.
Anders Nordin from the Swedish Maritime Administration said a Russian-owned oil tanker, Concord, which had reportedly been circling near Swedish waters for days, started sailing in a northeasterly direction toward Russia on Sunday morning.
But it suddenly turned around and headed back in the direction of Sweden, according to Marine Traffic, a website which monitors vessels in the Baltic Sea.
Media reports said the movements of the Liberian-flagged tanker might be connected to the submarine search.
In 1981, a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off Sweden s southeastern coast, causing an 11-day diplomatic standoff before Swedish authorities allowed the submarine to return home.
Swedish officials wouldn t speculate on what foreign power could be behind the suspected intrusion Friday.
Last month, the Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to protest a violation of Swedish airspace by two Russian military aircraft.

STOCKHOLM  AP  — Sweden calls off weeklong search for suspected submarine in Stockholm archipelago.
To prevent automated spam submissions leave this field empty.
Over the weekend, while the world was focusing on the threat of Ebola contagion in the US and around the globe, Sweden s otherwise sleepy capital Stockholm found itself the location of a blitz military operation involving the Swedish Armed Forces, Navy, Army and Air Force, when late on Saturday, Swedish armed forces stepped up an operation -- involving more than 200 men, stealth ships, minesweepers and helicopters -- in an area about 50 kilometres  30 miles  east of the Swedish capital.
The operation was initiated on Friday after the armed forces said they had been informed of a  man made object  in the water.
Cold War - an  intelligence operation .
At the moment we are conducting an intelligence operation in the archipelago of Stockholm with optical reconnaissance as well as with naval vessels equipped with qualified underwater sensors.
And while it has been neither confirmed nor denied, a media report by the respected Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet , put the blame for the rapid mobilization on what it said was a damaged Russian submarine located just off Stockholm.
The report said that Swedish military intelligence had intercepted radio signals between an area off the coast of Stockholm and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad -- home to much of Russia s Baltic Sea naval fleet.
Svenska Dagbladet reported that the sighting was at an island in Kanholmsfjärden, an inlet located just over 50 kilometres  30 miles  from the city centre.
Soon the navy also showed up.
Anonymous military sources told Svenska Dagbladet that the emergency signal in Russian was intercepted on Thursday evening, and that further encrypted signals were sent on Friday after Swedish armed forces began combing the area.
Over 14 years ago, in August 2000 the Kursk, a Russian nuclear submarine, sank in the Barents Sea killing the entire crew of 118.
Russian authorities were later criticised for refusing international assistance and for misleading the public about the pace of their failed rescue operation.
In recent months, Sweden has reportedly seen an uptick in Baltic Sea manoeuvres by the Russian air force.
In one incident in September, two SU-24 fighter-bombers allegedly entered Swedish airspace in what then Foreign Minister Carl Bildt at the time called  the most serious aerial incursion by the Russians  in almost a decade.
During the 1980s and early 90s the then-neutral -- and now non-aligned -- Nordic country was regularly on alert following Russian submarine sightings, including one notable case in 1981 when a Soviet U-boat ran aground several miles from one of Sweden s largest naval base.
0, it would not be surprising if Russia has decided to pay Stockholm a visit or two.
Russia’s submarines, like the surface ships, have been following their tasks in the world’s oceans according to the plan,” he said.
If not Russia, then who?
Only nine countries have access to the Baltic Sea: besides Sweden, they are Germany, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Finland and Estonia.
Only Germany, Poland, Russia and Switzerland have own fleets of submarines.
AC-12, nuclear submarine, which came online in 2003, after the Kursk incident.
So did a Russian sub merely get lost, or was this just another transit route as Russia scrambles to weaponize the Arctic and defend its numerous oil and gas fields located there?

That s the exact location where my crate of gold and silver fell off my boat.
Russians for going after it?
I ve never got a sample ballot in the mail.
I also never heard back from my congressman after I told him to man up and do something positive.
Big surprise!
Russia should salt the coasts of Western countries with hundreds of transponders intermittently broadcasting on that frequency.
Think of all the practice the West s navies would get.
Please somebody tell that is a typo and they meant Sweden?
Lake Geneva is not that big is it?
I KNEW IT!
The Swedes have found MH370!
N.
NO, I guess it s some Limey derivative.
Looks like a Lockheed  skunkworks  radar-invisible design.
In the case of naval vessels, I guess they could call it the  SUNKWORKS .
Aluminium   aluminum , for you  merkuns   doesn t really corrode in salt water, does it?
Of COURSE the Swiss have a navy!
Every Saturday night, my youngest son plays with them in the bath.
I tried to get him the full contingent of  Swiss Army  toys to play with, but there was only one available  until he quit .
I am in the process of teaching him about banking by opening his own  Swiss bank account , but it s difficult.
He doesn t know about looting gold from occupied countries in Europe just yet  youth has it s disadvantages, I suppose .
OMG!
Sweden has deployed ALL 200 MEN  and their ship, and their plane !
No, no I can t.
BTW, I heard that the sole purpose of Switzerland s submarine fleet is to guard the undersea entrance to their cheese mine.
Dude,  calm TF down.
I was with SIK that day, fishing & cavorting, and that s the exact location where BOTH our crates of gold and silver fell off the boat.
Worse yet, SIK didn t even mention this, but we lost many firearms and tens of thousands of rounds of ammo that day.
And we got skunked in terms of fish not biting.
Twas truly tragic.
Friends don t let friends go boating with gold and silver.
Shame!
Friends don t let friends go boating withOUT gold and silver.
NO Shame!
There, fixed it for you.
NO undersea cables in that area?
REALLY?
Do TELL!
I m sure you have maps and links that show that there are NO UNDERSEA CABLES in that area.
I AM AM NOT AN ASSHOLE for calling you on your post, and YOU ARE a misdirecting LIAR for posting it in the first place.
FUCK YOU,  ajax .

Now you re gonna die.
Wait, what?
This also made me laugh.
But seeing Poland on that list made me think of jokes that were told to me as a child.
Canada bought 3 of those from the Brits.
Okay, who pissed in Ajaxs  cornflakes this morning?

YOU signed up for the long term service commitment, but you have been LACKING as of late.
Do you KNOW what happens to plebes like YOU who can t MAN UP and FACE THE CHALLENGE, even after 4 years on the INTERWEBS?
Only three were lost with all hands: two from the United States Navy and one from the Russian Navy.
Welcome to the matrix.
One day, you will recognize the fact that those on this site are somewhat ignorant  but seekers, as well .
In the CONUS, they call them  INCIDENTS .
The  Thresher Incident , or the  Columbia Incident , for stark examples.
The CORRECT terminology used by  the PTB  is  COLLATERAL DAMAGE .
If they are at the depths that are described, and there is no way to rescue them, I pray that their end comes suddenly and painlessly.
If rescue is a possibility, I pray that the men involved all get salvation from sure death.
AMEN.
Shame if the Swedes depth-charge a  Russian  sub and it turns out to one of Israel s.
Last time Swedish army navy went ruski-sub-hunting in the Stockholm archipelago, it turned out being a false flag.
It was a ZATO sub  on a mission to change Swedes  minds to  ofificialy  abandon their country s neutrality and join the Empire of Darkness.
We ll probably be told it s an Palestinian sub, sent to invade Sweden after they recognised Palestine s right to statehood.
More USA  I don t know fuck all about geopolitics but I can make jokes about it all .
My advice to you little asshole, stay home and pay your bills.
Why are you so angry?
Did your momma ground you or something?
He s a idiot.

Swedish authorities shut down airspace above Stockholm on Monday, as they continued searching for a mystery foreign vessel that was sighted repeatedly off the coast of the Swedish capital last week.
Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported on Saturday that the search began last Thursday, after Swedish intelligence detected a number of Russian-language emergency radio signals, which were sent from the vicinity of the port of Stockholm to Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave located on the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania.
On Sunday, the Swedish Ministry of Defense confirmed the search for the vessel, though it refused to speculate on the national origin of its crew and refrained from calling it a submarine.
But a grainy surveillance photograph issued by the Ministry appears to show a submarine of considerable size —said to be Russian— peeking out of the waters of the Baltic Sea, at a location believed to be 30 nautical miles from Stockholm.
One English-language Swedish newspaper quoted Johan Wiktorin, a fellow at the Swedish Royal Academy of War Sciences, who suggested three possible reasons for foreign submarine activity in Sweden’s territorial waters near Stockholm.
Wiktorin speculated that the vessel could be “mapping the waters” around the Swedish capital, or it could be installing underwater surveillance equipment aimed at collecting a variety of maritime intelligence in the area.
Alternatively, the mystery vessel could be testing Sweden’s maritime defense systems, said Wiktorin.
On Monday, however, intense speculation appeared in local media about a fourth potential reason for the mystery submarine activity in Swedish territorial waters.
A photograph emerged showing a man dressed in black frogman gear on the Swedish island of Korso.
The image was purportedly taken by a local man at around the time when the submarine was sighted in the area.
The theory goes that the mystery submarine’s task was to either “pick up or drop off a Russian spy” without alerting Swedish authorities.
The latter refused to address the latest theory.
Moscow, meanwhile, has categorically denied that any of its military vessels are currently sailing in Swedish waters.
A Russian government spokesman said on Sunday that the alleged submarine might be a Dutch underwater vessel that was believed to be engaged in naval exercises in the region in the days before the sightings.

STOCKHOLM — Sweden called off a week-long hunt for a suspected foreign vessel in the waters of the Stockholm archipelago, ending its biggest naval mobilization since the Cold War.
Friday with most ships and staff having returned to base, the Armed Forces said in a statement.
Some ground units remain in the area “with specific tasks,” it said.
As local media has speculated that the vessel is a damaged Russian submarine, the navy has refrained from commenting on its origins.
The army said it received five credible reports of sightings since the chase began last Friday and that it’s “very likely” a foreign vessel has been hiding in its waters.
The mobilization was the largest since the Cold War days of the 1980s when Sweden frequently conducted submarine hunts along its Baltic Sea coast.

STOCKHOLM, October 24.
TASS .
The Swedish armed forces’ nearly week-long operation launched in an attempt to identify what has been described as “foreign underwater activity” near the Stockholm Archipelago has ended inconclusively, the operation s commander, Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad, told a news conference on Friday morning.
The armed forces are of the opinion foreign intelligence activity did take place.
The operation failed to identify the type, nationality or form of a foreign country’s operation,” he said.
We have never pointed to a specific country,” Grenstad added.
2 million.
Fire-fighters spend approximately as much during one weak to deal with forest fires, Grenstad said.
A source at the Russian Defence ministry earlier told TASS in the wake of reports of an allegedly disabled submarine the search was unsuccessful because there was none.
The official urged Sweden to pay attention to the Dutch diesel-electric submarine Bruinvis, which last week practiced various manoeuvres, including emergency surfacing, near Stockholm.
Photos of that submarine were leaked to the Swedish press.
Nine countries have access to the Baltic Sea.
Alongside Sweden they are Russia, Germany, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland and Estonia.
Only four - Russia, Germany, Poland and Sweden - have submarine fleets.

STOCKHOLM  Reuters  - It has all the makings of a Cold War thriller -- an emergency military deployment with stealth ships and helicopters hunting for a foreign submarine in the Stockholm archipelago.
Grainy photographs of a mysterious vessel.
Sightings of a black-clad man wading in shallow coastal waters.
Whether it was caused by paranoia or a secret naval mission, Sweden s biggest military mobilisation since the Cold War over the last three days has underscored growing concerns about Russian President Vladimir Putin s intentions in the Baltic Sea region.
In just over a month, an Estonian intelligence officer has been reported abducted by Russian forces, Finland has complained of Russian interference with one of its research vessels, and Sweden has lodged an official protest over a  serious violation  when Russian warplanes entered its air space.
With shades of Frederick Forsyth, the maritime mystery has fired the imagination of the region.
Moscow has denied it has any submarine in mechanical trouble in Sweden s waters, but nervous governments fear that the Baltic Sea could become the next flashpoint with Russia after Ukraine.
The search in the Baltic Sea, less than 30 miles  50 km  from Stockholm, began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final years of the Cold War, when Sweden repeatedly chased suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
But there have also been many false alarms.
In the 1980s, the military on several occasions thought it had detected submarines, only to find the underwater sounds had been made by minks or otters.
The military say they are now looking for a submarine, a mini-submarine or even divers amid the thousands of islands near Stockholm, many of them popular holiday destinations.
On Monday a no-fly zone was declared around the search area.
Growing tensions since the Ukraine crisis have already caused Sweden and Finland, both avowedly neutral before joining the EU in 1994, to openly discuss NATO membership.
Sweden s own military questioned its ability to defend itself for more than a week against a Russian attack after NATO warplanes were scrambled last year to meet Russian bombers rehearsing a bomb run on Sweden.
Anna Wieslander, deputy director at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs.
Wieslander said, adding that Russia has been gradually modernising its forces under Putin.
The Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, citing unidentified sources, said the latest incident had begun when encrypted radio traffic on an emergency frequency was intercepted on Friday from the Stockholm archipelago to the enclave of Kaliningrad, home to the Russian Baltic Fleet.
The Netherlands has denied reports from Russia that the source could be a Dutch naval submarine.
For Swedes, the affair evokes memories of 1981, when a Soviet submarine known by its Swedish designation U137 was stranded near a major naval base deep inside Swedish waters.
Swedes have been reading avidly about reports of a Russian ship with underwater recovery equipment heading to Swedish waters and a tanker circling the seas near Stockholm, adding to a sense of new Cold War espionage on their doorstep.
Swedish media said military intelligence was investigating a report that a man dressed in black had been spotted wading in an inlet between two islands, one of which, Korso, is used by the Swedish military and is off limits to the public.
Russia has long seen the Baltic as part of its sphere of influence, and still smarts at the former Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania entering NATO and the EU.
Finland also reached accommodations with the Soviet Union for decades.
Lithuania suspected a link between the submarine incident and a massive floating liquefied natural gas  LNG  terminal that is due to sail to Lithuania from Denmark this week.
Named Independence, the terminal is intended to reduce the Baltic region s dependence on Russian energy.
Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius called the timing of the Swedish search a  weird coincidence .
Estonia said on Monday that it was boosting surveillance around the islands of Hiiumaa and Saaremaa islands -- a potential resupply route from the West in the event of conflict with Russia to the east.
One thing that has changed since the Cold War is Sweden s preparedness after years of defence cutbacks.
Some observers say the navy lacks the capability to hunt and destroy submarines in its home waters after scrapping anti-submarine helicopters.
If the search finds proof of foreign military activity in Swedish coastal waters, it will represent the first real test of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven s centre-left minority government, less than three weeks after it took office.
His government will hope to do better than one incident in the 1992s, when a Swedish corvette fired a torpedo at a suspected submarine only to narrowly miss hitting itself.
Lofven told a news conference in Finland on Monday.

The Netherlands has denied a Russian claim that a mystery submarine that the Swedish military has been looking for could be Dutch.
The Swedish military launched a major search operation late on Friday after sightings of an unidentified vessel around islands off Stockholm.
A Russian defence ministry official suggested this morning that the vessel could be the Dutch Bruinvis, which had taken part in exercises off the coast of Sweden.
Russian news agencies.
The source said the Dutch diesel-electric submarine was carrying out tasks near Stockholm last week.
It was in the Estonian capital of Tallinn on Friday and was expected to return today, the source said.
Swedish media reported over the weekend that a Russian U-boat might be in trouble around islands off Stockholm.
However, the Swedish military said yesterday that it was not possible to determine the nationality of the vessel.
The Dutch defence ministry said its submarine was no longer in the area when the mystery vessel was reportedly sighted.
Dutch defence ministry spokeswoman Marnoes Visser told AFP.
The Bruinvis was now making its way back to the Netherlands, Ms Visser added.
The Russian defence ministry was not available for comment.
Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland s National Public Service Broadcaster.
Stockholm  AFP  - The Swedish armed forces announced a large military operation around islands off Stockholm late Friday following reports of suspicious  foreign underwater activity .
Commander Jonas Wikstroem told reporters.
He said the operation was based on a tip-off from a  credible source  and that about 200 Swedish troops were involved.
He added that no weapons had been used in the operation.
Wikstroem did not specify how close the operation was to the Swedish capital, nor whether the activity involved one of more submarines, but said that he was informing the public as the area has  heavily trafficked .
Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet reported that the sighting was at an island located just over 50 kilometres  30 miles  from the city centre.
In recent months, Sweden has seen an uptick in Baltic Sea manoeuvres by the Russian air force -- including an incident in September when two SU24 fighter-bombers allegedly entered Swedish airspace in what Foreign Minister Carl Bildt called  the most serious aerial incursion by the Russians  in almost a decade.
Wikstroem said Friday.
During the Cold War the then-neutral -- and now non-aligned -- Nordic country was regularly on alert following Russian submarine sightings, including one notable case in 1981 when a Soviet U-boat ran aground several miles from one of Sweden s largest naval base.

A massive search operation has engaged the Sweden’s military for the last three days.
Hundreds of sailors, divers and pilots have been scouring the waters off Stockholm  in search of  foreign underwater activity .
According to the Swedish military, they have intercepted a radio transmission in Russian on an emergency frequency and it has been believed that a mysterious Russian submarine has stricken in the waters of Sweden.
The operation started late on Friday.
In a Cold-War  style, when neutral Sweden regularly hunted for Soviet spy submarines in the Baltic Sea, the Swedish mobilised service personnel, minesweepers, helicopters and the anti-submarine corvette HMS Visby   K31 .
We still consider the information we received as very trustworthy.
Yesterday, on a press conference of the Swedish Navy , a grainy photograph of the mysterious  foreign vessel  was shown.
Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad explained that the picture had been taken by a credible source and it had been the third sighting so far.
This is not ours, it s a foreign vessel.
This is not a submarine hunt, using weapons to combat an opponent.
Later there can be a situation where it becomes a submarine hunt.
A spokesman from the Russian defence ministry denied the information for their vessel involved in a military operation.
Russian Navy ships and submarines are fulfilling their duties in the world ocean waters in accordance with the plan.
Last night, the Russian research vessel Professor Logachev  was tracked heading from St.
Petersburg  towards Sweden.
It was followed by three Dutch warships.
The transponder of Professor Logachev was turned off yesterday.
Bruce Jones, from IHS-Jane s suggested that there was a possibility for a small submarine to have run aground.
They might have been wanting to look under the highly-advanced ships which the Swedes are operating, to steal their technology.
According to him, the the submarine was likely to be short range and very small, hence the need for a mother vessel.
The intelligence analyst Joakim von Braun, said there was a chance that the submarine s soldiers had abandoned it and swum ashore.
They could have hidden and waiting to be taken.
If his theory is right, the submarine is  equipped with explosives so that a it can be timed to detonate 24 hours later .

The Swedish army staged a large military operation around islands off capital Stockholm after reports of suspicious  foreign underwater activity .
Ships, helicopters and around 200 troops were sent to the area, following a tip-off� from what authorities described as a  credible source .
He did not specify how close the operation was to the Swedish capital, nor whether the activity involved one or more submarines, but said no weapons had been used.
He said he was informing the public as the area has  heavily trafficked .
It comes after recent reports in Swedish media of an increase in Russian air force manoeuvres in the Baltic Sea, including a close encounter in early October between a Swedish spy plane and a Russian fighter jet.
Wikstroem said.
During the Cold War the then neutral - and now non-aligned - Nordic country was regularly on alert following Russian submarine sightings.
Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet is reporting that Swedish authorities are currently searching for a damaged Russian submarine in the Stockholm archipelago.
Swedish authorities launched their search after a mayday call between a transmitter in the archipelago and a transmitter in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad was detected which indicates that a damaged Russian submarine could be in Swedish waters.
A map tweeted by @defencechemist shows the path of the Russian oil tanker NS Concord which may be trying to assist the damaged Russian submarine.
Swedish authorities report that a Russian oil tanker may be attempting to reach the submarine.
The NS Concord which is owned and operated by a shipping company in Novorossiysk, was spotted circling an area in the Baltic Sea east of the Stockholm archipelago.
According to the report, the Swedish Navy ramped up its efforts in the Stockholm archipelago which suggests that there is a damaged submarine in the archipelago.
Minesweeper and other ships have been deployed including the HMS Visby and Sundsvall within Swedish coastal areas near Stockholm.
Swedish defence critics have noted that Sweden’s reduced armed forces no longer have the critical capability to search for submarines using helicopters in its vast coastal regions.
Sweden will not regain that capability until 2018, and no longer has any of its once numerous and highly competent special forces to protect coastal regions.
With escalating Russian military activity in the Baltic Sea – including serial air space violations over the past months- Sweden must look towards increasing its defensive capabilities.
The Swedish military has been so severely downsized in the past decade that even the large eastern island of Gotland has been left completely demilitarized years.
UPDATE: On Sunday, Swedish media reported that a man dressed in black, carrying a backpack was sighted and photographed near an island where a submarine was reported as being sighted.

Swedish Royal Navy vessels searched for an underwater intruder in the island-studded waters east of Stockholm on Monday after three sightings of a suspicious vessel and media reports of a Russian-language distress signal four days ago.
The response to a possible security breach, involving more than 200 naval personnel and dozens of ships and helicopters, was the widest by Sweden in the post-Cold War period, a reflection of the heightened tensions among Russia’s Baltic Sea neighbors since Moscow seized Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in February.

We have a different political security situation in the Baltic now, which means we react more quickly and more clearly state that we don’t accept this,” Rear Adm.
Anders Grenstad, deputy chief of operations at the Swedish Armed Forces, told reporters in Stockholm.
The navy considered it “probable” that there was unauthorized “foreign activity underwater,” Grenstad said, after three sightings of a vessel in the area since Friday.
He did not speculate about which foreign power might be responsible.
But the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, citing knowledgeable military sources, reported that the search for a foreign intruder was prompted by the interception Friday of a Russian-language distress signal sent via an emergency channel to a receiver in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
Kaliningrad, a wedge of Baltic coastline between NATO members Poland and Lithuania, is a major base for Russia’s Baltic Sea fleet and the only northern port for Moscow’s navy that is ice-free year-round.
The reports have intensified perceptions in the Baltic region that Russia is taking a menacing stand against its Western neighbors.
Stockholm authorities protested to Moscow last month after two Russian fighter jets penetrated Swedish airspace.
Finland, which shares an 800-mile border with Russia, last week complained that a Russian naval ship was interfering with a Finnish environmental research vessel in international waters.
And Estonia, another NATO member, says Russian agents abducted an Interior Ministry security official near the border in early September.
The man is reported to be jailed at the notorious Lefortovo prison in Moscow on espionage charges.
The Swedish navy on Sunday released a grainy photograph taken by a civilian showing a vessel that reportedly submerged moments after the image was captured.
An unsigned statement posted on Russia’s Defense Ministry website over the weekend said Moscow was unaware of any problems encountered by its naval forces.
The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, citing intelligence expert Joakim von Braun, said that the object sought by the Swedish navy appeared to be an advanced Triton-NN mini-submarine.
Von Braun also noted that Russian special forces are equipped with underwater survival gear and that if the vessel became disabled they might have abandoned it to await rescue on one of the thousands of small islands in the Swedish archipelago.
Clandestine surveillance of Baltic neighbors by Soviet-era vessels occurred regularly during the Cold War.
In 1981, a damaged nuclear-armed submarine was stranded off Sweden’s southeastern coast for 11 days while Moscow and Stockholm negotiated its release.
MOSCOW: A mysterious “foreign vessel” the Swedish military have been searching for off the coast of Stockholm might belong to the Netherlands, a source in the Russian defense ministry was quoted as saying yesterday.
To remove tensions in the waters of the Baltic Sea and to save money of the Swedish taxpayers we would recommend  Sweden  to turn to the naval command of the Netherlands for an explanation,” a source at the defense ministry in Moscow told Russian news agencies.
The source said that the Dutch diesel-electric submarine Bruinvis was carrying out tasks near Stockholm last week.
It was in the Estonian capital of Tallinn on Friday and was expected to return on Monday, the source said.
Swedish media reported over the weekend that a Russian U-boat might be in trouble around islands off Stockholm, but the Swedish military said on Sunday that it was not possible to determine the nationality of the vessel.
The Russian defense ministry was not immediately available for comment.
Meanwhile, The Netherlands yesterday denied a Russian claim that a mystery submarine that the Swedish military has been looking for could be Dutch.
The Dutch defense ministry said its submarine was no longer in the area when the mystery vessel was reportedly sighted.
We participated in an exercise with Sweden with several ships, but it ended last week Thursday,” Dutch defense ministry spokeswoman Marnoes Visser said.
The Bruinvis was now making its way back to the Netherlands, Visser added.
The Dutch submarine is not involved and we are further not involved in any search action or such,” she said.
Swedish Rear-Admiral Anders Grenstad on Sunday said the armed forces were carrying out an intelligence operation to establish the presence of a foreign vessel.
A Swedish media report had suggested that a Russian emergency transmission had been intercepted from the vessel-indicating that a Russian U-boat was in trouble in the area.

IT WAS as though the cold war had never ended.
A hazy shape spotted by island residents in the southern Stockholm archipelago on October 17th quickly prompted suspicions of an incursion by a Russian submarine.
The Swedish armed forces leapt into action, establishing a no-fly zone.
But after days of searching, the military is still not sure what, if anything, is out there.
Although officially neutral and not a NATO member, Sweden is no stranger to Russian provocations.
Besides the possible submarine, Russian planes have violated Swedish and Finnish airspace in recent months.
Sweden s new government , a coalition of the Social Democratic and Green parties, took power only a few weeks ago.
The submarine hunt is something of a baptism by fire for prime minister Stefan Lofven, who has been criticised for lacking international political experience.
On Monday, in Helsinki for his first official foreign visit, Mr Lofven tried to calm the waters, cautioning the public not to jump to conclusions.
Once part of the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are now among NATO s staunchest members, and have urged the European Union to take the toughest possible line on Russia for its actions in Ukraine.
The media are pulling out all the stops.
Newspapers are full of eyewitness accounts, fuzzy cell-phone pictures of purported submarine sightings or mysterious black-clad figures popping up on island beaches.
Many recalled earlier Swedish submarine incidents, including one 33 years ago this month, when a fisherman out early one morning discovered a Soviet submarine  armed with nuclear torpedoes  that had run aground.
After days of questioning the crew, and chilly diplomatic exchanges between Stockholm and Moscow, the Swedes allowed the sub to go home.
Some have accused the Swedish military of seeing phantom submarines under every rock in Swedish territorial waters, and many sub hunts over the years have led nowhere.
Still, the submarine hunt plays into an increasing Swedish anxiety over security.
The public does not support joining NATO, and Mr Lofven has ruled it out, though Sweden does participate in NATO s Partnership for Peace programme.
But the chairman of the defence committee in parliament, Allan Widman of the opposition Liberal party, said on Tuesday that he expected his committee to recommend raising the defence budget for next year.
That marks a shift from the previous conservative-led government, in which the Liberals were coalition partners, which cut defence.
In the Riksdag as in the waters off Stockholm, Swedes are finding their cold war memories seem a bit less stale.

Putin scares me.
We have such short attention spans.
This year he s orchestrated the take over part of Yukain.
BTW the freedom fighters in New uniforms weren t Russian Army thugs.
They were just regular thugs.
MH 17 was shot down with Russian supplied missiles.
No attempt to even try to cover it up.
150+ people are dead.
The world watched but did nothing.
It s not a stretch to have Russian sub in Swedish waters.
A trick they ve pulled many times before.
Again the world watches but no action.
Putin feels Russian is still.
SUPER Power.
No one has the back bone to stand up.
I think he s just getting started.
Looks like the Swedish Clowns are taking a leaf out of Uncle Sams book; Make up a load of anti-Russian propaganda crap in order to justify an increased military budget?
Why is this rubbish even in the Economist?
B-52s buzz European capitals in retaliation for withholding compliance to US demands.
Russians offer assistance to beleaguered Estonians and Poles.
You know your source entirely disproves your comment right?
The article clearly states that the B-52 were part of a cooperative exercise and makes no mention whatsoever of Russia helping Estonians and Poles.
This sort of deliberate misinformation is disgusting.
You have heard that Sweden is hunting a ”submarine” and that it is ”presumed to be Russian”.
1  There is not the slightest evidence of there being anything military, neither that it is a submarine nor that, whatever the object might be, it is Russian.
2  Even with CNN, BBC and AlJazeera this is nothing but speculative low-grade yellow press journalism.
3  It serves other purposes than bringing you information: either to increase further the negative image of Russia, push Sweden into full NATO membership – see the remarkable offer by NATOs former Allied Supreme Commander, Stavridis about NATO to come and help Sweden – or to scare the Swedes into feeling that it is necessary to pay even more to the Swedish military  a mechanism also called fearology .
Virtually every aspect of the media hype is based on prejudices instead of interest-based analysis and on partial and paid expertise that follows the ‘party line’.
Russia has ‘denied’ it is there; Holland has ‘dismissed’ that its submarine should be there.
The alleged-ness of it all is good enough to pass for objective reporting in the – alleged – free media.
Worse, the Swedish military has already made a fool of itself – not to be expected given the fairly large resources it has at its disposal.
It has sold off helicopters it now dearly needs.
It’s been – at least officially – relying on tips from ordinary citizens and one wonders where the intelligence  in more than one sense of that word  is.
A suspicion that a  Russian  special forces man had gone on land turned out to be an Swedish pensioner out fishing.
It has published a blurred photo of a wave-covered ‘object’ to be seen far out through some trees and indicated wrongly where that photo was taken.
One indeed wonders whether this farcical performance is made to show that it is so helpless that it must have large resources?
The more relevant consideration would be: How on earth can such amateurism be so easily accepted by the government, media and the people – and even used as an argument for what the PM has just announced?
Or to put it crudely: What do the Swedes get for their tax money?
Sweden with a population of roughly 9 million is # 33 on the world list of military expenditures, spending US $ 6,2 billion per year.
That is US $ 657 per capita, # 17 in the world.
Russia spends US$ 403 per capita and its overall  military expenditures is 8% of NATO’s.
Sweden, thus, is not a helpless pawn in some game.
If its military isn’t able to do better when it is really needed, some should be made responsible.
After all, most violations of the Swedish air space has been known since the 1980s to be done by NATO fighters but it’s basically only when Russian fighters come near or violate that the Swedish defence establishment leaks it or the media are interested in it.
Sweden isn’t a neutral country today, if it ever were.
My concluding prediction is therefore rather simple: for the above reasons the Swedish military will soon call off the whole thing and the affair will have served its purpose – precisely by not stating what it was, who it was or why it was.
Or if it was.
What the purpose of the event may be remains to be revealed at some point in the future.
Or perhaps never – if  the purpose was fearology for increased militarisation.
Somebody somewhere knows what’s going on.
And they put citizens’ security at risk for purposes they would never tell you.
Russia s military budget is actually the third largest in the world.
But how can  money per capita  help Sweden find anything underwater?
Are these Swedish kronas per capita which are currently in search for a mysterious underwater object or what?
If we dig a little further beneath that assertion, a different picture emerges.
02 trillion.
745 trillion in 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden.
In 2012, China’s expenditures amounted to $166 billion and Russia’s were $90 billion.
By troop numbers, NATO also held a lopsided advantage over any other nation, with a total of 3,370,000 service members in 2013, according to NATO’s statistics.
This contrasts with Russia’s 766,000 troops, according to Sam Perlo-Freeman, director of SIPRI’s program on military expenditures.
S.
As for Russia, Perlo-Freeman said it could compare with the West only in its nuclear capabilities.
In constant 2011 dollars, the total military spending of NATO nations in 2010 was greater than at any other point in the alliance’s history.
This includes at any point during the Cold War.
The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the world’s “defense” spending.
S.
7 billion on defense.
This compared to Russia’s paltry $ 80 Billion or so, dwarfed by even the UK, France, Italy and Germany’s combined $ 200 Billion.
S.
NATO members have defense expenditures that are more than three times Russia’s total.
Sweden is not a member of NATO.
It pursues a policy of neutrality.
The Swedish military are about to prove being technically unable to find a submarine that has teased them right in their territorial waters.
As some Swede put it,  I am 99% sure there is something out there, but I’m 100% sure they won’t find it .
You wrote of kronas  stolen from hard working Swedes by the Mafia State .
The latter is a synonym of Russia, as we know.
How did it come Russia robbed Swedes, when, and where?
It looks to me like the old pro from KGB now residing in Kremlin trying only to assure himself that the boys did not forget all the old tricks.
Apparently they are getting a little stale.
Submarine parts from China.
One Ruble store in Vladivostok.
180 degrees off course.
2 The crew went AWOL when vodka ran out onboard.
Svedka cheaper than Absolut.
Absolut instead of Svedka.
Somehow, the submarine veered off course.
The crew desperately need some heat to keep warm.
Russia mafia.
Russian solution.
Question for me is    What does Russia get with this? , it´s stupid to force the rope when is already in full tension, so there is no logic in that.
Russia has been trying to react softly in a problem where  Europe has been getting their nose into Ukrania when we   Reagan, Mitterrand and Thatcher  offered Gorbachev not to extend NATO  with them, we didn´t keep our word.
Frankly speaking the only reason behind all this is the american pressure  t find a new enemy, this time one suitable for military industry needs.
Maybe they were trying to be found - maybe they were trying to embarrass or intimidate the new Swedish government.
Maybe they were just on a routine mission and were headed elsewhere.
Maybe they were conducting an exercise to test their capabilities and failed.
Anyways, if I was in charge of tons of nuclear subs I would want to do something with them  but not start a nuclear war, obviously .
I would also want to know what they were capable of.
And, of course, maybe there never were any subs in the water in the first place.
I suppose Swedes need those Russian uboots so that they can take part in top secret mission of their military on behalf of NATO as it were.
We know that they did because aicraft was lost on one such mission.
This is just boring or it would be boring if it was also not so transparent.
This or Swedish military is just a hoax.
Short term it is probably safer for Sweden to embarrass its military than to raise a conflict.
It appears as though the Swedish government is trying to manipulate its citizens into supporting increased defense spending and perhaps even into joining NATO.
This kind of propaganda is unmistakable and fear usually leads to the knee-jerk reaction required to impose such an unwanted change.
Hopefully the Swedes aren t as stupid as their government expects.
The real question is; what will Sweden do when they actually pin point the sub?
The Sub s probably is now out of Swedish waters after all the publicity.
Paranoia is seeing irrational threats and overreacting with strange and psychotic behavior.
Normal fear is healthy.
It keeps us safe.
It is seeing REAL THREATS and acting effectively.
Wisdom is knowing the difference between Paranoia and Healthy Fear.
Europeans complain about US activities because they are unethical and because in history of humankind there was not one invention or technological advance that have not been used for suppression of dissent.
These days we have scientifically proven methods of extended interrogation so even this is not as brutal as it used to be - progress I guess.
We should be happy - the torture chambers of CIA do not produce cadavers anymore or at least not unintentionally.
As for Swedish submarines - these events may or may not have relationship to Russian military activity.
Till that is proven I consider them stories on the level of Loch Ness monster - come to think of it, the same monster could cause it after all there are underwater connections between Scottish lake and ocean so that is as feasible.
Total boss that wanted to go on with the business with Russia as usual got killed.
Could be coincidence.
On the other fronts - OECD observes find mass graves of mutilated bodies that apparently were left by ukrainian military.
There are reports of use of cluster bombs in civilian areas.
Children got killed in Donietsk - surely Putin did all this.
I do not know why this all happens.
Could be coincidence.
Could be a plan.
Could be a coincidence that some skilled and ruthless use to use and obscure by additional smoke and screens.
It all serves well US if Germany and Russia gets weakened and Gas supplies get disrupted.
Not too much but enough to make future investment in own liquefied gas installations feasible.
I do not know if that is all true.
Maybe not but I am sure somebody will use it to its own advantage.
In the meanwhile we still do not know why two AWACS were observing the area of MH17 shotdown, whether there was no Ukrainian airforce in the area and why on earth were the civilian aircraft allowed in the area besides profits for overflight fees.
We blame Putin because that is easy.
There is a Ukrainian Army general that think that is allbollocks and considers requests fro the east as legitimate as the ones mad on Maidan before regime change.
There are some other questions like why humanitarian convoys from Russia were not allowed in - to make Putin lose patience and let them get in illegally?
Nicely done.
Meanwhile sanctions hurt Germans but they do not do anything to US.
US have a long history of supporting bastards as long as they do what US want.
US can do to pay its debt for damage done in the area - I have serious doubts if this help does not cause significant damage of which we will become aware sooner or later.
Russians are no better and have less power than US do.
This does not make US any better on ethical grounds.
You keep praying that the Russian sub is fake.

MOSCOW: A mysterious “foreign vessel” the Swedish military have been searching for off the coast of Stockholm might belong to the Netherlands, a source in the Russian defence ministry was quoted as saying on Monday.
To remove tensions in the waters of the Baltic Sea and to save money of the Swedish taxpayers we would recommend  Sweden  to turn to the naval command of the Netherlands for an explanation,” a source at the defence ministry in Moscow told Russian news agencies.
The source said that the Dutch diesel-electric submarine Bruinvis was carrying out tasks near Stockholm last week.
It was in the Estonian capital of Tallinn on Friday and was expected to return on Monday, the source said.
Swedish media reported over the weekend that a Russian U-boat might be in trouble around islands off Stockholm, but the Swedish military said on Sunday that it was not possible to determine the nationality of the vessel.
The Russian defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.
This amateur photo made available on October 19, 2014 by the Swedish Defence Ministry shows an object  top C  in the sea near Stockholm.
Sweden released the grainy photo of a mysterious vessel in Stockholm s archipelago, as the military hunted for a foreign submarine or divers in the country s biggest such mobilization since the Cold War.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 30 miles  50 km  from Stockholm began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final years of the Cold War when Sweden repeatedly sought out suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
The military showed one picture of what appeared to be a craft surrounded by white ripples.
The witness who took the photograph said the vessel then submerged -- one of three sightings that the military said were credible reports.
NEW YORK: A US nurse, whose enforced quarantine in New Jersey sparked a furious backlash after she returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa, was to be discharged today, officials said.

The hunt for a possible Russian submarine operating clandestinely in Swedish waters might sound familiar to those of us who lived through the Cold War: That s because it bears striking similarities to a 1981 incident that made international headlines and proved a major embarrassment for Soviet authorities.
Late Sunday the country s navy presented a grainy picture of what appeared to be some kind of craft moving among the islands of the Stockholm archipelago, which stretches some 80 kilometers east of the capital.
The picture, taken by a member of the public, wasn t of good enough quality for the object to be clearly identified but it showed something elongated and white in the water with a smaller black object pointing out of its upper side.
So far, Sweden hasn t said which country is suspect, and Russia has denied involvement.
The news agency quotes Latvia s Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics as saying the incident is a potential  game changer  in the region.
WSJ writes.
The grounding of U137, an aging diesel-electric Whiskey-class boat , became known, partly tongue-in-cheek, as the  Whiskey on the rocks  incident.
It came at a particularly hot time for the Cold War: Two years after the Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan, hard-liner Leonid Brezhnev was still leader of the USSR, and President Ronald Reagan, who took an uncompromising stance toward Moscow, was still in his first year in office.
Months after the U137 incident, martial law would be declared in Poland as part of a Communist Party crackdown on the Solidarity movement led by Lech Walesa.
So, why would a Russian submarine want to be snooping around Sweden in 2014?
Sweden may not be a member of Nato, the dark alliance that Moscow s defence chiefs have identified as Russia s number one enemy.
But it has always taken defence of its  neutrality  extremely seriously.

So, the Swedish navy is looking for  foreign underwater activity , presumably a Russian submarine in the Stockholm archipelago.
It is the fourth day of the search, involving ships and helicopters.
The Swedish military earlier said it was investigating three credible sightings of  foreign underwater activity .
It denied looking for a submarine, and said that it was conducting an intelligence operation.

Swedish corvette HMS Visby patrols the Stockholm Archipelago, searching for what the military says is a foreign threat in the waters.
Sweden released a grainy photo of a mysterious vessel in Stockholm’s archipelago yesterday, as the military hunted for a foreign submarine or divers in the country’s biggest such mobilisation since the cold war.
The search in the Baltic Sea less than 50km from Stockholm began on Friday and reawakened memories of the final years of the cold war when Sweden repeatedly sought out suspected Soviet submarines along its coast with depth charges.
The military showed one picture of what appeared to be a craft surrounded by white ripples.
The witness who took the photograph said the vessel then submerged – one of three sightings that the military said were credible reports.
The Swedish armed forces have consistently labelled the their hunt one of investigating “foreign underwater activity” but elaborated on what that might entail yesterday.
It could be a submarine, or a smaller submarine,” Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad told a news conference.
Rear Admiral Grenstad said the sightings had taken place in “an area that is of interest to a foreign power”, but added he was not in a position to link the observed activity to any particular nation.
This does not belong to us.
It is a foreign vessel and we have no indications that there would be any civilians involved in underwater activity,” he said.
The incident comes amid rising tension with Russia among the Nordic and Baltic states – most of them EU members – over Moscow’s involvement in the Ukraine crisis.
Finland last week accused the Russian navy of interfering with a Finnish environmental research vessel in international waters.
Reported sightings of one man dressed in black wading through waters led to speculation of Russian special forces in the archipelago, normally a popular holiday destination consisting of thousands of small islands.
The Russian defence ministry said yesterday that there were no emergencies in the Baltic involving its vessels.
Russian Navy ships and submarines are fulfilling their duties in the world ocean waters in accordance with the plan,” Interfax news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying.
Should the present search find proof of foreign military activity in Swedish coastal waters it will represent the first real test of prime minister Stefan Lofven’s centre-left minority government less than three weeks after it took office.
In 1981, a Soviet submarine known under its Swedish designation U137 was stranded deep inside Swedish waters not far from a major naval base in the neutral country, sparking intense suspicion about the scale and motives of such incursions.

STOCKHOLM  AP  - Sweden’s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.
In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.
While Sweden hasn’t linked any country to the suspected intrusion, the incident sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region, where Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea and air in recent months.
Closely following events in the Swedish territorial waters, may become a game changer of the security in the whole Baltic Sea region,” Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said.
Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday, just 25 miles west of Stockholm amid the myriad of islands and skerries that stretch from the capital into the Baltic Sea.
Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but stressed that unlike Sweden’s submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn’t using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.

STOCKHOLM  CNN  — There are fears of Russians and it is October, but it is not a Tom Clancy novel.
It is a case of international naval intrigue off the Swedish coast that brings back memories of the Cold War.
The story began Thursday when Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian, according to a report from the English-language website The Local, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet .
On Friday more radio transmissions were intercepted, and there were reports of a foreign vessel spotted in waters around islands near Stockholm.
The Swedish military responded, sending ships and helicopters to search for the source of the radio transmissions, which were being sent to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 330 miles  530 kilometers  south of Stockholm on the Baltic’s southern shore, according to The Local report.
The intrigue deepened Sunday when the Swedish military announced at a press conference that it has been monitoring suspicious activity in the area for several years, according to another report in The Local .
Russia on Sunday denied it has any vessel in Swedish waters and suggested that if a foreign vessel is there it may belong to the Netherlands, according to a report from Russia’s Itar-TASS news agency .
On Sunday, October 19, the Russian Defense Ministry provided assistance wherever possible to the Swedes in their unsuccessful search, saying that there were no incidents with Russian warships  in the Baltic Sea , including submarines,” a Russian Defense Ministry source told TASS in a report Monday.
For easing tension in the Baltic Sea and saving Swedish taxpayers’ money, we would advise  the Swedish side  to request explanations from the Dutch Navy command,” the source said in the TASS report.
It suggested the vessel might be a Dutch sub that was in Sweden for exercises last week.
The Dutch were quick to respond to the TASS report Monday, saying a sub involved in the exercises was anchored in Tallinn harbor of NATO-ally Estonia for the weekend, according to a report from Agence France-Presse .
On Monday, there has been no letup in the Swedish search for a suspected intruder, and the military vowed to continue searching at least for the next few days, according to The Local .
We have good stamina,” The Local quoted defense spokesman Dag Enander.
We’re using the sensors we have and are searching both from land and water,” Enander was quoted as saying.
Civilian vessels were ordered to stay at least six miles  about 10 kilometers  away from a Swedish warship conducting searches around the Stockholm islands, The Local reported.
All the activity begs the question, why would a Russian sub need to snoop around in Swedish waters anyway?
They could be mapping the waters in order to be able to navigate them in the event of hostilities,” Wiktorin is quoted as saying.
They could also be installing equipment, like sensors, that could track or get an observation of our units in that area,” he goes on.
Whether there is a Russian sub in Swedish waters or not, there is no question that Russian forces have been active in the Baltic and around the globe this year.

Swedish corvette HMS Stockholm patrols Jungfrufjarden in the Stockholm archipelago Monday.
Sweden s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge, with Latvia s foreign minister calling the incident a potential  game changer  in the region.
STOCKHOLM – The Swedish navy stepped up its hunt Monday for a suspected foreign submarine in its waters with fingers pointing at Moscow in a throwback to the Cold War.
Swedish soldiers and sailors were scouring the sea southeast of Stockholm in the biggest operation of its kind for years, while the public was warned for the first time to keep a distance and airspace restrictions were enforced.
The mystery around the alleged incursion thickened Monday, with Russia and the Netherlands denying that the vessel was theirs as tensions in the Baltic rise over the crisis in Ukraine.
There’s an increase in military exercises from both the Russian and the NATO side,” Prime Minister Stefan Loefven said, speaking at a press conference in Helsinki.
In one of two airspace violations in September, two Russian SU-24 fighter-bombers allegedly entered Swedish airspace in what Foreign Minister Carl Bildt at the time called “the most serious aerial incursion by the Russians” in almost a decade.
The Baltic Sea, an area of immense strategic importance, saw intense naval maneuvering throughout the Cold War years, with the Soviet Navy paying particular attention to neutral Sweden’s long, rugged coastline.
In the most widely known incident of that era, a Soviet submarine ran aground in 1981 near the major naval base of Karlskrona, and was only allowed to leave after a lengthy, humiliating wait.
Even after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Sweden has continued to keep a close eye on vessels believed to be foreign submarines.
Speculation mounted Monday over the whereabouts of the elusive vessel as the armed forces extended the search area southward to open sea about 70 km  44 miles  southeast of Stockholm.
As the search expanded, the military warned the public for the first time to keep a distance of at least 10 km  6 miles  from the operation — while stopping all nonessential air transport in the area.
Since the armed forces received a tip-off about a “man-made object” on Friday, stealth ships, minesweepers and helicopters have combed the sea around islands close to the Swedish capital.
There is no submarine hunt underway, there is an ongoing intelligence gathering operation,” Loefven said in Helsinki.
The search, which entered its fourth day on Monday, has triggered widespread speculation in the Swedish and foreign media that the vessel might be Russian.
Russia instead pointed the finger at the Netherlands, saying that the mystery submarine may be Dutch.
That claim was met with a swift denial from the Hague, which said its submarine was “not involved,” having left the area after taking part in a naval exercise with Sweden.
Tomas Ries, an expert at the Swedish National Defence College, said he had little doubt that the vessel was of Russian origin.
There are so many indications that it would be Russian.
It’s very hard to imagine that any other country would send minisubs into Stockholm’s archipelago,” he said.
On Sunday night the Swedish armed forces released a photo taken the same day of what it believed was a “foreign vessel” near islands about 50 km  30 miles  east the Swedish capital.
Ries said that the ongoing incident was different from recent airspace violations by Russian jets, which he called “very visible signals — part of a diplomatic exchange”.
This seems to be something that they really wanted to keep secret, an operation that they were carrying out and trying to do clandestinely … deep inside Swedish waters,” he said.
With concern growing about the possibility of an unravelling of the European security order in the aftermath of the Ukraine crisis, events in Sweden racked up tensions around the Baltic.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said on Twitter that he was following events in the Swedish territorial waters closely.
It  may become a game changer of the security in the whole Baltic Sea region,” he tweeted on Sunday.
The submarine wreck was discovered by a research ship of the Swedish Maritime Administration the 10 September.
A closer study with a radio-controlled underwater vessel indicate that the submarine may be ‘Gepard’, one of twelve submarines of the Bars  snow leopard  class who operated in the Baltic Sea during WW1.
We have a strong suspicion that it’s ‘Gepard’, says Hans Oiås, responsible for the Swedish database of shipwrecks, to news agency TT.
The submarine with 40 people in the crew was, according to Oiås, on a mission together with other submarines to guard a line of mines west of the Estonian island Saaremaa.
It was reported lost in October 1917, but has now most likely been found after 92 years on international waters, 30 admiralty miles  northeast of the Swedish island  Gotska Sandön.
The submarine likely collided with a mine and sank to the bottom with the crew onboard.
The submarine is split, but besides damages from the blasting the wreck is surprisingly intact.
The Russian Embassy has been informed about the finding.
It’s not everyday you find a submarine.
Its’ a little bit exciting and it’s also a piece in the military history and the history of the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea”, Hans Öiås says.
The submarine has eight torpedoes mounted on the deck still in place.
It’s up to the Navy if they think anything must be done to the torpedoes, but I don’t think the wreck will be brought to surface”, he says.
A submarine of the same class, ‘Levitsa’, was discovered by the Swedish Navy north of Gotska Sandön in 1992.
The discovery was classified until February 1993.
That wreck is still on the bottom of the sea, Russian authorities choose to hold a memorial service and declare the spot to be a war grave.
I think something similar could be expected also for this finding”, Hans Oiås says.
For the time being it is not possible to post comments.

For over a week, the Royal Swedish Navy and Air Force have been frantically looking for a suspected Russian submarine in Ingaro Bay, the main port approach to the wharves of Stockholm.
On Thursday, the search was finally called off, ending the largest Swedish naval operation since the end of the Cold War, according to Swedish Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad.
The search comes at a time of high tension between North American and European nations and Russia, in light of the summer crisis in Ukraine, where pro-Russian militants and suspected Russian heavy equipment clashed with Ukrainian army and police forces.
Canadian, and Estonian airspace according to NORAD and NATO sources.
In the meantime, Sweden would do well to revisit its sonar and submarine detection capabilities.
Sweden, while not a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has signed a pact with the alliance on September 5th,  allowing it to engage in joint training exercises and receive assistance from NATO troops in emergencies.
Sweden, who has maintained strict neutrality in every war since the Napoleonic Wars in the early 1800′s, should perhaps revisit NATO membership.
Along with Finland, these two new Scandinavian members could ratchet up the pressure on Russia and force it to rethink its aggressive strategy.

STOCKHOLM — Sweden’s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.
In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters, and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.
While Sweden hasn’t linked any country to the suspected intrusion — and Moscow suggested it was a Dutch sub — the incident sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region, where Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea, and air in recent months.

Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday, just 25 miles west of Stockholm amid the myriad islands and skerries that stretch from the capital into the Baltic Sea.
On Sunday they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel — a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.
Speculating on whether the suspected watercraft was linked to a mother ship, Swedish media zeroed in on an oil tanker owned by Russian company Novoship, which had been circling near Swedish waters.
In a statement Monday, Novoship president Yuri Tsvetkov said he was flattered by the attention but said the ship was charted for transporting oil from Russia to the United States and was drifting on standby awaiting loading orders.
The events have sparked alarm across the Baltic Sea in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

It was in the Estonian capital of Tallinn on Friday and was expected to return on Monday, the source said.
Swedish media reported over the weekend that a Russian U-boat might be in trouble around islands off Stockholm, but the Swedish military said on Sunday that it was not possible to determine the nationality of the vessel.

Swedish Armed Forces continue to inspect the waters near the Stockholm archipelago to establish the presence of a foreign submarine in the area.
However, the military do not hurry with making conclusions about what kind of an object exactly could be staying in the Swedish waters.
It could be a submarine or a midget submarine.
It could also be a diver using stand-alone means for movement in the water.
It could be several divers who have nothing to do on our territory.
Swedish military officials said.
Earlier, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported that a foreign submarine  presumably a Russian one  could be staying among the islands of the archipelago of Stockholm.
According to sources of the publications, the military intercepted radio signals from an unidentified underwater object located in the  territorial waters of Sweden.
The radio receiver, the newspaper wrote, was located in Russia s Kaliningrad.
It was noted that the broadcast was conducted on the frequencies that the Russian Navy uses in extreme situations.
The publication therefore concluded that the submarine could be experiencing a state of emergency.
Spokespeople for the Russian Defense Ministry officially stated that there were no accidents with Russian submarines recorded.
According to representatives of the department, all vessels perform routine tasks in the areas of the oceans; no states of emergency were recorded.
Experts are also confident that the information about a foreign submarine near the coast of the kingdom is unconvincing.
In addition, the information about the signal of distress sent to Kaliningrad has nothing to do with reality.
Sweden has had the syndrome of Russian submarines since 1981, when a Soviet submarine, due to a navigation error, entered Swedish territorial waters and ran aground  near the main base of the Swedish Navy, Karlskrona.
Since then, prior to adopting the defense budget, a  Russian submarine  always appears in the Swedish waters.
St.
According to him, there are several channels of communication on board submarines.
Registering the fact of radio broadcast is possible, although, it is impossible to either intercept or decrypt it.
Establishing the direction of the radio signal is impossible due to laws of physics, the expert said.
Meanwhile, it was reported that a foreign submarine that was detected in the area of the Stockholm archipelago, may belong to the Netherlands Navy, Interfax reported with reference to the Russian Defense Ministry.
It was the Dutch submarine Bruinvis that was conducting practical operations last week near Stockholm.
The photos that appeared in the Swedish press, were made at the time, when the sub was practicing emergency ascent.
Sweden s Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said at a press conference that the search for a foreign submarine in the region of the Stockholm archipelago continued.
He noted that Sweden had no information about the affiliation of the detected object.
The official did not confirm local media reports, according to which a Russian submarine was allegedly in distress in the Baltic Sea.
A source in the headquarters of the Russian Northern Fleet said that the submarine, which, according to the Scandinavian media, was detected in the Swedish waters, could not be Russian.
Russian diesel submarines are in Kaliningrad, Kronstadt and the Northern Fleet, whereas the only carrier of mini-submarines was awaiting repairs.
The source excluded a possibility for nuclear submarines  submarines of the Russian Northern Fleet are mostly nuclear-powered  to maneuver in the waters of the Baltic Sea due to inconsiderable depth.
Two of the three diesel submarines stationed at the Northern Fleet - B-806 Dmitrov and B-227 Vyborg - are respectively staying at the Krondshtad Shipyard and in Kaliningrad.
The third submarine, Saint Petersburg, is currently in the Northern Fleet.
The only vehicle for midget submarines, submarine Orenburg, currently awaits repairs.

RKacinskas Does it start with an R and end with Ussia?
RKacinskas Lots of Swedish men use your Lithuania as a sex tourist destination.
How proud you must be.
RKacinskas right now the only official term is  underwater activity .
Could be a lot of stuff, lets not exclude civilian underwater craft.
RKacinskas Well, if not a substantial observation, why all this fuzz?
RKacinskas I mean civilian underwater craft for sport.
Too early to point out foreign navy as culprit.
Cannot be excluded, of course.
RKacinskas it does sound like a credible observation of something out of the ordinary, but at this stage the options are MANY.
RKacinskas Could be a Russian submarine on holiday.
They like to take their weapons abroad in Russia.
LarsGyllenhaal Or maybe subs have just been lost.
This seems have been happening quote often recently.
LarsGyllenhaal don t joke, I ve seen this bad dream,  green  subs!
RKacinskas yes, I think next Christmas some SU-34 flying just for holiday to St.
Moritz in CH!

The Swedish navy’s search for a ‘mystery foreign vessel’ in the waters near Stockholm continues for a fourth day, with ships, helicopters, and around 200 troops involved in the operation.
The military has reportedly asked civilian vessels to evacuate the area between the island of Nattaro and Danzinger Gatt as they try and close in on the unknown vessel in the Stockholm archipelago, made up of some 30,000 islands.
Early rumours on Friday were that the vessel was some form of Russian submarine, possibly a ‘midget sub’, that was lost, damaged or possibly replacing old underwater espionage equipment.
However, the waters in which it has been spotted are well within Swedish territorial waters, and any foreign vessel in this location would be a violation of Swedish waters and would cause an international incident.
Russia has dismissed the notion that there is an “irregular situation” involving its ships, and claimed that a Dutch submarine in the area may have triggered the Swedish alert system, a claim quickly denied by The Hague.
The conflict in east Ukraine has resulted in increased alert levels about the possible threat from Russia in the Baltic region.
The vessel has been spotted three times since Friday in the waters near Stockholm, at Kanholmfjärden, Nämdöfjärden, and Jungfrufjärden.

SWEDEN has mobilised aircraft and warships to hunt a Russian submarine believed to have sent a secret distress call late last week.
Suspicions were raised when a commercial tanker operated by Russia was noticed circling in a narrow area of Swedish waters.
Defence offials then mobilised the Swedish military, sending patrol ships and helicopters to search for what they called “foreign underwater activity”.
Swedish news website SvD  Nyheter now claims the search is aimed at locating a possible Russian submarine believed to have sent a distress call on a Russian emergency frequency.
The newspaper website cites “credible sources” saying the tranmission was made in plain language, followed by a second encrypted transmission on Friday.
The transmissions were traced to Swedish waters.
While Sweden’s government has not revealed the nature of the incident, speculation surrounds the behaviour of the oil tanker NS Concord, a Liberian-registered vehicle that has apparently been circling in Swedish waters for the past week.
Sweden’s TT news agency reports a press officer for the nation’s military as saying the military activity was due to possible “foreign underwater activity” inside the Stockholm archipelago — some 50km from the city centre.
More than 200 men, Swedish stealth ships, minesweepers and helicopters have been searching the area since yesterday.
The military says the activity was based on information from a “credible source” — but would not say what that information was other than it involved “foreign underwater activity”.
We still judge that the information we received yesterday was very trustworthy,” a military spokesman added, but declined to comment on what the military had discovered after more than 24 hours sweeping the sea around islands in Stockholm’s archipelago.

Shortly after Sweden announced concerns that there may be “foreign underwater activity” in the area, the tanker turned east towards Russian waters.
The suspected Russian incursion follows reports of two Russian Su-24 fighter bombers violating Swedish airspace last month.
A major diplomatic crisis was sparked in 1981 when a Russian submarine ran aground in sensitive waters.
Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist said he was receiving regular updates from the Armed Forces, who had informed him the operation, involving around 200 troops, was “necessary and well-founded”.

No government representatives have commented on the nature of the information that had prompted the military activity.
We have support for the analysis work we are now carrying out in the area in the form of ships, planes and territorial army personnel.
Sweden’s new Social Democrat Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist — who took office just a fortnight ago — refused to comment on the military operation.
What’s been happening in the Baltic Sea, including airspace incursions, shows that we have a new, changed situation,” he told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.

The Swedish corvette HMS Visby under way on the Mysingen Bay on October 21, 2013 on their fifth day of searching for a suspected foreign vessel in the Stockholm archipelago.
The search was being extended southwards to the open sea about 70 kilometres  44 miles  southeast of Stockholm, as Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Loefven said that more military exercises were being carried out in the Baltic Sea.
STOCKHOLM — Sweden s biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.
In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.
While Sweden hasn t linked any country to the suspected intrusion — and Moscow denies involvement — the incident sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region, where Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea and air in recent months.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter.
Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday.
On Sunday they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel — a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.
Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but stressed that unlike Sweden s submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn t using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.
The search made headline news in countries across the Baltic region including in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, three former Soviet republics spooked by Russia s intervention in Ukraine.
Estonia stepped up surveillance of its territorial waters, with the border guard looking out for  potential anomalies,  spokesman Priit Parkna said.
In Lithuania, the events in Sweden sparked concerns over the safety of a floating natural gas import terminal currently being transported on the Baltic Sea to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda.
The terminal will be key to Lithuania s plans to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.
Meanwhile, Russian media suggested the Swedes were overreacting.
The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even speculated that the submarine hunt could be a ploy staged by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget, which has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War.
The official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all, noting the Swedes hadn t found anything.
A Defense Ministry official quoted by the Tass news agency pointed fingers at a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week.
The unidentified official suggested Sweden should save  taxpayers  money  and ask the Netherlands for an explanation.
The Dutch navy said that the submarine left Sweden on Thursday and had been in Estonia since early Friday.
In Sweden, Armed Forces spokesman Philip Simon said the Dutch submarine was not what triggered the Swedish search.
In 1981, a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off Sweden s southeastern coast, causing an 11-day diplomatic standoff before Swedish authorities allowed the submarine to return home.
Matti Huuhtanen reported from Helsinki.
AP reporters Lynn Berry in Moscow, Toby Sterling in Amsterdam, Rayyan Sabet-Party in Riga, Latvia, Liudas Dapkus in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Jari Tanner in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report.
The Swedish army staged a large military operation around islands off capital Stockholm after reports of suspicious  foreign underwater activity .
Ships, helicopters and around 200 troops were sent to the area, following a tip-off  from what authorities described as a  credible source .
He did not specify how close the operation was to the Swedish capital, nor whether the activity involved one or more submarines, but said no weapons had been used.
He said he was informing the public as the area has  heavily trafficked .
It comes after recent reports in Swedish media of an increase in Russian air force manoeuvres in the Baltic Sea, including a close encounter in early October between a Swedish spy plane and a Russian fighter jet.
Wikstroem said.
During the Cold War the then neutral - and now non-aligned - Nordic country was regularly on alert following Russian submarine sightings.

Three sightings of a mystery vessel near the Swedish capital spark a strong response from the nation s navy and its people who remember similar scenes during the Cold War.
Crew members onboard a Swedish Navy fast-attack craft stand guard at the Stockholm archipelago.
Swedish authorities have asked all civilian vessels to leave waters south of Stockholm as a major operation continues to try to track down a mystery foreign vessel.
In scenes reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish ships and helicopters scoured the area in a hunt for what some observers think could be a Russian submarine.
Russia denies it has a vessel in the area.
Russia s official government newspaper said either Sweden s echo location equipment was faulty or  as the old saying goes, the eyes of fear see danger everywhere .
Swedish prime minister Stefan Loefven said the search was being extended southwards to the open sea about 70 kilometres southeast of Stockholm, and more military exercises were being carried out in the Baltic Sea.
Mr Loefven told a media conference in Helsinki.
As the search expanded, the military warned the public to keep a distance of at least 10 kilometres from the operation.
Since Sweden s defence forces received a tip-off about a  man-made object  on Friday, more than 200 men, several ships, minesweepers and helicopters have combed the sea around islands close to the Swedish capital.
Mr Loefven said.
On Sunday night the Swedish armed forces released a photo taken the same day of what it believed was a  foreign vessel  near islands about 50 kilometres east of the Swedish capital.
For many Swedes the sight of more than 200 members of the country s armed forces on the hunt for a suspected hostile vessel has been evoking a spooky sense of deja vu, because reported sightings of Russian submarines regularly sparked security alerts during the Cold War.
It s very, very weird.
There have been three reported sightings of the mystery vessel in recent days, but the chairman of the Swedish Defence Committee Allan Widman said so far conclusions could not be drawn.
The Swedish defence forces have got enough other indicators that they re not releasing to make them determined to make this very massive investment.
They re not chasing ghosts.
Then there has been a Russian ship lying just outside Swedish territorial waters for the duration of this crisis.
My conclusion from this is that it s probably a Russian mini-submarine - one or more.
There s roughly two motives we could find: one is that they re there to see what the Swedes have placed down there, so it s reconnaissance.
Mr Reis said a possible  Loch Ness monster  scenario was unlikely.
To my mind, that indicates that they are very sure about this.
They are professionals, they know what they re doing.
