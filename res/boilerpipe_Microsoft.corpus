Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for Altair 8800 .
It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows .
The company s 1986 initial public offering , and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.
Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions .
5 billion in its largest acquisition to date.
As of 2013, Microsoft is market dominant in both the IBM PC-compatible operating system and office software suite markets  the latter with Microsoft Office  .
The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including Internet search  with Bing  , the video game industry  with the Xbox , Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles , the digital services market  through MSN  , and mobile phones  via the Windows Phone OS .
In June 2012, Microsoft entered the personal computer production market for the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface , a line of tablet computers .
With the acquisition of Nokia s devices and services division to form Microsoft Mobile Oy , the company will re-enter the smartphone hardware market, after its previous attempt, Microsoft Kin , which resulted from their acquisition of Danger Inc.
October 19, 1981, in a sea of PCs after signing a pivotal contract.
IBM called Microsoft in July 1980 inquiring about programming languages for its upcoming PC line;  :228 after failed negotiations with another company, IBM gave Microsoft a contract to develop the OS for the new line of PCs.
Paul Allen and Bill Gates , childhood friends with a passion in computer programming , were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills.
In 1972 they founded their first company named Traf-O-Data , which offered a rudimentary computer that tracked and analyzed automobile traffic data.
Allen went on to pursue a degree in computer science at the University of Washington, later dropping out of school to work at Honeywell.
Gates began studies at Harvard.
11] The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems  s  MITS  Altair 8800 microcomputer .
Allen suggested that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device; after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration.
Since they didn t actually have one, Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter.
Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in Albuquerque , New Mexico in March 1975; MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC .
9] :108, 112–114 They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO .
12] Allen came up with the original name of  Micro-Soft,  the combination of the words microprocessor and software, as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article.
13]  In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office,   ASCII Microsoft  .
15] The company moved to a new home in Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.
Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix , called Xenix .
16] However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company s dominance.
After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP M OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer  IBM PC .
17] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products , branding it as MS-DOS, which IBM rebranded to PC DOS .
Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS.
Since IBM copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS , other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles , but no such restriction applied to the operating systems.
Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS s available software selection, Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.
10]  :210 The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as a publishing division named Microsoft Press .
9] :232 Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in February after developing Hodgkin s disease .
While jointly developing a new OS with IBM in 1984, OS 2 , Microsoft released Microsoft Windows , a graphical extension for MS-DOS, on November 20, 1985.
9] :242–243, 246 Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond on February 26, 1986, and on March 13 the company went public ;  the ensuing rise in the stock would make an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.

21] Microsoft released its version of OS 2 to original equipment manufacturers  OEMs  on April 2, 1987;  :243–244 meanwhile, the company was at work on a 32-bit OS, Microsoft Windows NT , using ideas from OS 2; it shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the Win32 application programming interface  API , making porting from 16-bit  MS-DOS-based  Windows easier.
Once Microsoft informed IBM of NT, the OS 2 partnership deteriorated.
In 1990, Microsoft introduced its office suite, Microsoft Office .
The software bundled separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel .
0 with a streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor.
23] Both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.
24]  Novell , a Word competitor from 1984–1986, filed a lawsuit years later claiming that Microsoft left part of its APIs undocumented in order to gain a competitive advantage.
S.
Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive  per processor  licenses.
Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system.
In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM s use of a competing PC operating system.

28] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking , a completely new user interface with a novel start button , and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.
29]  :20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN , and for OEMs Internet Explorer , a web browser .
Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web browser, and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus!
31] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and NBC Universal created a new 24 7 cable news station, MSNBC .
0 , a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants .
33] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court , stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.
Bill Gates handed over the CEO position on January 13, 2000, to Steve Ballmer , an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect .
9] :111, 228  Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to, among other things, increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software.
Critics decry the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, a form of digital rights management ; for example the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner as well.

Windows 7 s focus was on refining Vista with ease of use features and performance enhancements, rather than a large reworking of Windows.
As the smartphone industry boomed beginning in 2007, Microsoft struggled to keep up with its rivals Apple and Google in providing a modern smartphone operating system.
As a result, in 2010, Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile , replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS; along with a new strategy in the smartphone industry that has Microsoft working more closely with smartphone manufacturers, such as Nokia , and to provide a consistent user experience across all smartphones using Microsoft s Windows Phone OS.
It used a new user interface design language, codenamed  Metro , which prominently used simple shapes, typography and iconography, and the concept of minimalism.

The Price to Earnings  P E  ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock s most        recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations        for the trailing 12 month period.
A company s net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.
Reflects the total market value of a company.
Market Cap is calculated by multiplying        the number of shares outstanding by the stock s price.
For companies with multiple        common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes.
Number of shares that are currently held by investors,        including restricted shares owned by the company s officers and        insiders as well as those held by the public.
The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade.
To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.
Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded.

Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock,     based on the value of trades made on an  uptick  in price and the value of     trades made on a  downtick  in price.
The up down ratio is calculated by     dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades.
Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

Yes, the deal is real.
Mojang is being bought by Microsoft.
It was reassuring to see how many of your opinions mirrored those of the Mojangstas when we heard the news.
Change is scary, and this is a big change for all of us.
It’s going to be good though.
Everything is going to be OK.
Please remember that the future of Minecraft and you – the community – are extremely important to everyone involved.
If you take one thing away from this post, let it be that.
We can only share so much information right now, but we’ve decided that being as honest as possible is the best approach.
We’re still working a lot of this stuff out.
Mega-deals are serious business.
Why did you sell Minecraft?
Minecraft has grown from a simple game to a project of monumental significance.
Though we’re massively proud of what Minecraft has become, it was never Notch’s intention for it to get this big.
As you might already know, Notch is the creator of Minecraft and the majority shareholder at Mojang.
He’s decided that he doesn’t want the responsibility of owning a company of such global significance.
Over the past few years he’s made attempts to work on smaller projects, but the pressure of owning Minecraft became too much for him to handle.
The only option was to sell Mojang.
He’ll continue to do cool stuff though.
Don’t worry about that.
There are only a handful of potential buyers with the resources to grow Minecraft on a scale that it deserves.
We’ve worked closely with Microsoft since 2012, and have been impressed by their continued dedication to our game and its development.
We’re confident that Minecraft will continue to grow in an awesome way.
Minecraft means many different things to millions of people across the world, and to each and every Mojangsta.
We feel that this is the best way for everyone – you guys included – to benefit.
What about the other editions of Minecraft?
Will they stop being developed?
There’s no reason for the development, sales, and support of the PC Mac, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, Vita, iOS, and Android versions of Minecraft to stop.
Of course, Microsoft can’t make decisions for other companies or predict the choices that they might make in the future.
We’re extremely proud of all editions and the awesome things you have achieved through playing together.
Is the game going to change?
Will we still be able to make videos, mods, awesome builds, and all the cool stuff we’ve created over the past few years?
Minecraft will continue to evolve, just like it has since the start of development.
We don’t know specific plans for Minecraft’s future yet, but we do know that everyone involved wants the community to grow and become even more amazing than it’s ever been.
Stopping players making cool stuff is not in anyone’s interests.
What about the Mojang staff?
What’s happening to you guys?
Though it’s too early to confirm which of us will continue working on Minecraft or other projects, we predict that the vast majority  if not all  Mojangstas will continue to work at Mojang for the time being.
The founders: Notch, Carl, and Jakob are leaving.
We don’t know what they’re planning.
It won’t be Minecraft-related but it will probably be cool.
What’s happening to the other Mojang projects, like Scrolls?
We don’t know yet.
We’ll share any news as soon as we do.
Will you still be able to tweet about features and interact with the community on a personal level, just like you’ve done over the years?
Yes!
That’s not going to change.
How much money was the company bought for?
5 BILLION dollars.
Thanks for reading everybody.

District Court, Southern District of New York.
Today’s legal action is simply to enforce our contract with Samsung.
We don’t take lightly filing a legal action, especially against a company with which we’ve enjoyed a long and productive partnership.
Unfortunately, even partners sometimes disagree.
After spending months trying to resolve our disagreement, Samsung has made clear in a series of letters and discussions that we have a fundamental disagreement as to the meaning of our contract.
Samsung and Microsoft are both large and sophisticated companies.
In 2011, after months of painstaking negotiation, Samsung voluntarily entered into a legally binding contract with Microsoft to cross-license IP – an agreement which has been extremely beneficial for both parties.
Samsung had been complying with the contract and paying to use Microsoft’s IP.
So what changed?
Since Samsung entered into the agreement, its smartphone sales have quadrupled and it is now the leading worldwide player in the smartphone market.
Consider this: when Samsung entered into the agreement in 2011, it shipped 82 million Android smartphones.
Just three years later, it shipped 314 million Android smartphones.
Source: IDC, WW Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker – 2014 Q1, Published: May 2014] Samsung predicted it would be successful, but no one imagined their Android smartphone sales would increase this much.
After becoming the leading player in the worldwide smartphone market, Samsung decided late last year to stop complying with its agreement with Microsoft.
In September 2013, after Microsoft announced it was acquiring the Nokia Devices and Services business, Samsung began using the acquisition as an excuse to breach its contract.
Curiously, Samsung did not ask the court to decide whether the Nokia acquisition invalidated its contract with Microsoft, likely because it knew its position was meritless.

Have you ever had something on your phone that you really wanted to show to your friends and family, but they had to huddle around you and your PC, tablet, or smartphone just to show them?
This happened to me last weekend when my parents were visiting from out of town and I wanted to show them photos from my wedding this last summer our photographer took.
1.
With the Wireless Display Adaptor, I don’t have to worry about getting everyone to huddle around a device.
All the content I care about, along with audio, is easily shared on the big screen.
All you need to do is plug the USB end and HDMI end of the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter into an HDTV, monitor or projector.
Then select the right input on your TV, pair it with your laptop, tablet, or smartphone and you’ll be ready to go.
Then just wirelessly project your screen from your Miracast-enabled device.
It’s that simple.
Depending on your device, you can have it mirror exactly what’s being shown on the screen of your device or extend its screen.
Because the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter uses Miracast technology, you’re not limited to certain apps or content streaming.
It’ll show anything and everything from your device!
I was lucky to get my hands on a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter to try out for myself.
First, I connected it to my HDTV.
Easy.
Then I made sure to put my HDTV on the appropriate input.
The Microsoft logo popped up on the screen and told me it was ready to connect.
I fired up my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet and projected to the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter and before I knew it, my Start screen was showing up on my HDTV.
Also really easy.
1 .
With my Dell Venue 8 Pro connected, I was able to see everything on its screen also on my HDTV  I chose to mirror the screen .
I ended up opening Nextgen Reader and reading a bunch of articles before going into Flipboard .
I also watched a bunch of videos from YouTube.
The other thing that is really slick is being able to open Office documents – like a PowerPoint slide deck – and have it shown on my HDTV through the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.
This makes it a great tool for use at work – in a conference room – and not just at home.
Remember, the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter works with projectors and monitors too, so no more searching for the right, fitted adapter that plugs into your laptop every time you’re presenting.
You can also bring the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter with you when you’re traveling and hook it up to the HDTV in your hotel room to play movies  and keep the kids entertained  or check out your photos from the day.
From my Lumia 1520, I ended up watching a few episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation from Hulu.
The moral and ethical debate in the episode “I, Borg” never gets old.
The great thing here is it also plays audio through the HDTV as well.
The Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter really is simple and easy to use!
The other thing to note is that while I used it with my Dell Venue 8 Pro and Lumia 1520 – the Microsoft Wireless Adapter also works with Android devices too.
Just sayin’.
S.
Microsoft Store and at Best Buy and Microsoft Retail Store locations.
I don’t get it though.
Does this stream at any resolution?
Does it max out the TV’s resolution  eg.
4k on 4k monitors ?
If so, doesn’t it render the $200 dock which streams 4k a little useless?
Microsoft confuses me sometimes  a lot of times .
Anyway, I’m a little curious as to how it works technically and how lag free it is.
I’m pretty sure 4K is to high to be transmitted wireless at the moment.
At least there will be some noticeable lag.
Therefore, the dock is still pretty useful, and besides that, you get a lot more ports as well.
But, if you haven’t tried Miracast receivers before, you will be amazed to how easy it is.
1 does.
So, basically, all you need to do, like with any other HDMI input, is you need to switch over to the right channel source, for that specific HDMI input your adapter is connected to.
After that you find the “Device” options in the charm of Win 8, and from there you can choose to Miracast to your device, which you have to connect pair with one time of course.
And then you just get a stream of your laptop tablet smartphone.
And if I’m not mistaken you can actually make a stream-only of different apps like Netflix, so you can use your tablet laptop in the mean time, while watching a movie on your TV.
The lag is pretty good as well.
You cannot, as far as I understand, get a no-lag wireless signal this way.
There will always be some things that gives you some lag, but what I have experienced, it is not much at all.
I would not recommend playing games this way, since that is actually too laggy in my opinion.
But anything else, you don’t have to worry about lag.
Does it mean that the device will support splash page on hotel WiFi login?
If yes, then that’s pretty cool.
Something that Chromecast unable to do up to this point.
If the monitor has other free USB outlets, can you plug accessories into those and access them from your dell venue pro 8 via miracast?
I have both a Chromecast and a Netgear Miracast adapter.
The Miracast adaptor projects the screen of my kindle fire, surface pro, surface 2, and my husbands Galaxy note on any HD TV and any projector with HDMI inputs in 1080 p.
It projects anything that you have on the screen, games, PowerPoints, Movies, etc.
I use it all the time, also when I give presentations.
I hardly ever use Chromecast.
I think the Microsoft adaptor will do the same as the Netgear, but it is smaller and you do not need a  HDMI and a USB cable to connect it.
Is the Miracast feature available on the Lumia 920?
Additionally, I have a first generation MS Surface RT; is that Maracas enabled?
I have a question about it that maybe you can answer, can I use it with VGA projector  via an adapter or a convertor  ?
It supports Airplay, Android devices, Windows phone devices, and PC’s.
There is a projector company currently offering them for free if you purchase one of their mid-range models, and that blog should give you loads of information on EZcast.

An introduction to the mind-bending world of quantum computing.
Microsoft s new film series  On the Whiteboard  explores topics at the intersection of technology and culture, and introduces people, places and things behind the products.
Our CEO Shantanu Narayen and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella take the #AdobeMAX stage to talk about bringing creativity and productivity closer together.
New Microsoft CEO Nadella talks to employees for the first time as the company s CEO.
These heroic women show what spirit, courage, and perseverance can achieve.
May their bravery inspire us in 2014 and beyond.
Satya Nadella s first interview as CEO of Microsoft, at the company s campus in Redmond, Wash.
Sarah Churman went 29 years of her life wearing hearing aids.

Steve Ballmer.
Satya Nadella, as Gates returns to the fold.
O.
Satya Nadella, at Microsoft’s campus, in Redmond, Washington.
They are both engineers, and they are both businessmen.
In the language of the Myers-Briggs personality test, designed to measure how people perceive the world and make decisions, they both strike others as NTs, meaning they are highly rational seekers of knowledge.
So perhaps they’ll work together seamlessly to run Microsoft, helping it meet the huge challenges it now faces.
Gates devoted most of his time and energy during the last six years to his $40 billion philanthropic effort, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, but when Microsoft announced Nadella’ s appointment on February 4, he decided to devote 30 percent of his time to Microsoft.
There’s a sense in the world outside Redmond, Washington, that Microsoft’s best days are behind it, that the sprawling colossus, which employs more than 100,000 people, doesn’t know what it is, or even what it wants to be.
Gates and Nadella are adamant that’s not the case, and they are both adept at the sort of big-picture corporate-speak designed to persuade people that the company not only has its act together but also has a vision.
In their view, this new world of unlimited computing power, where your devices can connect you anytime, anywhere, should rightfully belong to Microsoft.
When I ask them what excites them most, Nadella looks at Gates.
Sure,” Gates replies.
This is, says Nadella, “a great world.
It’s not lost on a few other people who are capable of exploiting that world.
But the thing .
And whoever does the best job of building the right software experiences to give both organizations and individuals time back so that they can get more out of their time, that’s the core of this company—that’s the soul.
That’s what Bill started this company with.
That’s the Office franchise.
That’s the Windows franchise.
We have to re-invent them.
Gates says, taking up the thread.
Absolutely.
You know, when it comes to vision, speech, handwriting, screens that are going to be pervasive, that are going to let you navigate information in rich new ways, in ways that you understand your customer, what’s going on with your products.
He adds, “The opportunity is pretty incredible.
The way I think about success is our relevance,” says Nadella.
Relevance, however, is exactly what Microsoft doesn’t have, according to its critics.
The Irrelevance of Microsoft” is actually the title of a blog post by an analyst named Benedict Evans, who works at the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
90 percent in 2009 to just around 20 percent today.
This staggering drop occurred not because Microsoft lost ground in personal computers, on which its software still dominates, but rather because it has failed to adapt its products to smartphones, where all the growth is, and tablets.
That is a particularly wounding comparison, because, as any tech person knows, IBM is the company that two decades ago an aggressive young Microsoft helped topple from the pinnacle of great technology companies.

O.
Steve Ballmer at Microsoft’s offices in Bellevue, 1985.
Around three-quarters of Microsoft’s profits come from the two fabulously successful products on which the company was built: the Windows operating system, which essentially makes personal computers run, and Office, the suite of applications that includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
Financially speaking, Microsoft is still extraordinarily powerful.
7 billion of cash on its balance sheet.
But the company is facing a confluence of threats that is all the more staggering given Microsoft’s sheer size.
Competitors such as Google and Apple have upended Microsoft’s business model, making it unclear where Windows will fit in the world, and even challenging Office.
In the Valley, there are two sayings that everyone regards as truth.
One is that profits follow relevance.
The other is that there’s a difference between strategic position and financial position.
It’s easy to be in denial and think the financials reflect the current reality,” says a close observer of technology firms.
O.
2000.
His contentious tenure ended more abruptly than most people expected when he stepped down last February, after announcing he would do so in August 2013.
Fortune called a “textbook example of how not to do CEO succession,” and which at first focused on candidates who didn’t work inside the company, Nadella, who has spent 22 years at Microsoft, was chosen.
Until then, his name was barely known in the outside world.
O.
Gates and Ballmer are both aggressive personalities.
They stopped speaking to each other as a result of the bad blood surrounding Ballmer’s resignation.
The balance of power between Gates and Ballmer is not as obvious as it may seem.
At Gates’s current clip of stock sales he will be out of Microsoft by the end of the decade.
Meanwhile, Ballmer has sold very rarely, and so the consigliere now owns more of the company than the founder.
Indeed, Ballmer’s 333 million shares, worth some $15 billion, make him Microsoft’s largest individual shareholder, with a 4 percent stake.
These days Ballmer, the man who once referred to Microsoft as his “fourth child,” is working out of a 40th-floor condominium some 20 minutes from the sprawling campus he once presided over, having meetings with basketball greats.
I’m kind of moving on,” he says.
It will make Nadella’s job a little bit easier.
O.
Ballmer, as you might expect, has his own way of scoring his tenure, and it is not the Valley’s way.
He was an applied-math-and-economics major at Harvard, and he likes to quantify things.
In his new office he pulls out a chart that tracks the profits of the top 25 technology companies from 2008 through 2013.
Back in 2008, Microsoft was the most profitable company, earning 15 percent of all the profits generated.
In 2013 it was the second-most-profitable company  after Apple , earning 12 percent of all the profits generated.
In technology “it’s easy to glorify the products produced and the reputations won, not the money made,” he says.
8 billion.
Steve will never get the credit he’s due,” a former executive says.
But Ballmer is willing to acknowledge his mistakes.
I probably under-shifted to one or two things, and I feel bad about that.
I don’t feel bad about social networking.
Good for Facebook, great, but I don’t feel bad .
I feel a little differently about search, and a little differently about phones.
We should have done better.
What Ballmer calls his “biggest mistake,” though, is neither phones nor search.
It was a software project called Longhorn, and it happened early in his tenure.
Longhorn, which Microsoft began working on in 2000, was supposed to be the next generation of Windows.
2000, until 2006, led the project.
It was a foolishly ambitious project, more ambitious than could be built,” says a former Microsoft executive.
Gates is a big-picture technologist, not a product person—and he couldn’t or wouldn’t listen to the engineers who were telling him that what he wanted couldn’t be done.
Worse, Longhorn basically failed just as Apple released Tiger, which did what Longhorn aspired to do.
Microsoft had to start over from scratch three years into it.
Renamed “Vista,” the operating system was released late, lacked key features, and had many failings that enraged customers.
The worst work I did was from 2001 to 2004,” says Ballmer.
And the company paid a price for bad work.
I put the A-team resources on Longhorn, not on phones or browsers.
Who shoulders the blame is a matter of debate, but the fact is neither Ballmer nor Gates stopped the failure from happening, even as almost everyone else saw it coming.
I felt pretty completely responsible for the company,” Ballmer says.
It is a well-known part of Microsoft history that Ballmer and Gates fought bitterly during the first year of transition.
Among other things, when an engineer was displeased with Ballmer, he’d go to Gates.
Some Microsoft employees from that era refer to Ballmer and Gates as “Mom and Dad,” and recall that no one knew which parent was in charge.
I didn’t know how to do it,” says Ballmer.
At the urging of both their wives and Microsoft’s board of directors, the two men patched things up at what Ballmer calls a “really awkward, terrible dinner” at the Bellevue Club in early 2001.
It was like My Dinner with Andre, Ballmer says, referring to the 1981 film in which two old friends slowly realize they have radically different worldviews.
They officially made up, and Gates turned the company over to Ballmer.
I’m not going to need him for anything,” Ballmer told The Wall Street Journal when Gates finally left completely.
For those who romanticize the Gates era, Microsoft’s current predicament will always be Ballmer’s fault.
For others, it’s not so clear.
He left Steve holding a big bag of shit,” the former executive says of Gates.
S.
Gates and his company can never be calculated.
In addition, the dotcom bubble had burst, causing Microsoft stock to collapse, which resulted in a simmering tension between longtime employees, whom the company had made rich, and newer ones, who had missed the gravy train.
There is one thing everyone agrees on, which is Ballmer’s genuine love for Microsoft.
He cares more about Microsoft than anyone in the world, including Bill,” says a former executive.
Some people found it inspiring, but perhaps, in business, it is possible to care too much.
Certainly there were also disadvantages to Ballmer’s approach.
I am a salesman by nature: I want you to actually agree with me.
Don’t just come on the voyage with me.
Believe,” he told a crowd at Oxford University last winter, his voice rising to a bellow.
Oh, you don’t believe?
Emotionally volatile” is a not uncommon description of Ballmer.
Challenge was betrayal.
His view was that anyone in the company who used the iPhone was a traitor,” says this person.
And Ballmer, partly due to his sheer physical presence, is intimidating when he is not pleased.
People tended to acquiesce rather than risk his wrath.
One person even likens the result of what he calls “Ballmer’s ability to drive sub-optimal human behavior” to the state of affairs in Afghanistan.
Ballmer might be a complicated character, but he has nothing on Gates, whose contradictions have long fascinated Microsoft-watchers.
He is someone who has no problem humiliating individuals—he might not even notice—but who genuinely cares deeply about entire populations and is deeply loyal.
He is generous in the biggest ways imaginable, and yet in small things, like picking up a lunch tab, he can be shockingly cheap.
Q.
The rules of human life that allow you to get along are not complicated,” says one person who knows Gates.
But he combines that with flashes of insight and humor that leave some wondering whether he can’t do it or simply chooses not to, or both.
His most pronounced characteristic shouldn’t be simply labeled a competitive streak, because it is really a fierce, deep need to win.
The dislike it bred among his peers in the industry is well known—“Silicon Bully” was the title of an infamous magazine story about him.
And yet he left Microsoft for the philanthropic world, where there was no one to bully, only intractable problems to solve.
Today, the public Bill Gates seems polished, without many traces of the badly groomed enfant terrible of Microsoft’s early days, who would rock when he spoke and eviscerate an underling who gave him an answer he didn’t like.
Many people credit his wife, Melinda, for the improvements.
Bill is smart enough to construct himself as a human being with Melinda’s help,” says someone who has known him for decades.
But Gates, though he tries, still can’t always maintain the construct privately.
Admirers say that this is only to be expected from someone who has had no adult supervision since his teenage years, and who, because of his sheer genius, has never had to play by the rules most of us are forced to learn.
A loose generalization might be that those who see Gates in situations where he is not the one in control are less forgiving.
He was so publicly and so early in life defined as the brilliant guy,” says a person who has observed him.
Microsoft’s culture was confrontational from the start.
But what worked so well when the company was young and small carried the seeds of future problems.
About both Gates and Ballmer, a former executive says, “Their passion too often crossed the line into abuse.
That’s terrible when you become the role model that others are trying to emulate.
Maybe Gates and Ballmer could get away with it.
Many people liken the relationship between Ballmer and Gates to a marriage.
It is like couples that get divorced and hook up again,” says someone who knows both men.
At the root of Gates and Ballmer’s friendship, famously begun when both were Harvard students, was a deep respect for each other’s intelligence.
U.
Ballmer was Gates’s best man when he married Melinda, in 1994, and, an early Microsoft executive says, in the old days, when Microsoft was run by a small executive council, there were a few people who rose to the status of first cousins—but the family was Bill and Steve.
Everyone else was a hired hand,” this person says.
In 2006, Ballmer described the relationship in his own way to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
I think brothers tend to argue a lot, and somehow they stay brothers and stay connected,” he said.
No one will ever know for sure what would have happened to Microsoft if Gates had stuck around.
But there is a special reverence accorded the founder that will never be accorded his successor, and even if Gates wouldn’t have been the solution, Ballmer became the problem.
As the billions of dollars he invested in new ventures failed to show any return, even investors who thought Microsoft should be trying to keep up got increasingly dissatisfied.
Then there was another set of investors, who wanted Microsoft to slim down and pay out its cash hoard to them.
Ballmer, who likes to use the phrase “the tyranny of or” to describe the horror of being forced to choose between alternatives, wanted to preserve all his options.
He wasn’t willing to give up on the idea that Microsoft could “build new muscle,” as he likes to put it, and catch the next wave, and he wasn’t about to tell investors what they wanted to hear.
There was even a period when he refused to meet with them, and their dislike of him became visceral.
O.
2017.
But he says today that that changed.
2010, in which he told the board that his target departure date was “no less than three years, but no more than five”—in other words, between 2013 and 2015.
I had to have a few glasses of wine before I could hit send,” he admits.
O.
Amazon to Apple to Oracle.
While Ballmer won’t give me names, another person who is familiar with events corroborates that the two had started looking.
But there was a problem: they couldn’t find anyone.
At the same time, the pressure was building.
The heavily hyped next iteration of Windows, Windows 8, which launched in 2012, was regarded as a flop.
Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder, the powerful but behind-the-scenes mutual-fund giant Capital Group, was quietly agitating for change.
ValueAct, a hedge fund that had taken a $2 billion stake in the company, wanted a board seat too.
There was clearly a feeling that the board had been neutered for long enough.
But there was no sign either inside or outside that change at the top was imminent.
Indeed, Ballmer seemed to have no intention of leaving when he announced a massive reorganization of the entire company in July 2013.
Behind the scenes he had also begun negotiating an acquisition that was meant to transform Microsoft.
He had become convinced that the company had to make hardware too.
The reason why goes back to his chart.
The two companies which have seen the greatest increases in the share of profits they take are Apple and Samsung, particularly Apple, whose share of the technology industry’s profits leapt from 7 percent in 2008 to 21 percent in 2013.
Stephen Elop, had worked at Microsoft.
There was a defensive reason for the deal as well as an offensive one.
Nokia was pretty much the only company left that was making Windows phones.
If Nokia went under, what would happen to Microsoft’s phone business?
But on August 23, 2013, came the stunning announcement that Ballmer would retire.
O.
O.
O.
But there is another version of the story.
On the board, the Nokia acquisition, according to several sources, became increasingly controversial as the clock ticked.
Ballmer told a friend that he wouldn’t have pursued it at all had the board not initially encouraged it, so he was surprised by the growing discord.
At the same time he became utterly convinced that Microsoft had to buy Nokia.
At the Microsoft board meeting in late June 2013, Ballmer announced he had a handshake deal with Nokia’s management to buy the company, pending the Microsoft board’s approval, according to a source close to the events.
Ballmer thought he had it and left before the post-board-meeting dinner to attend his son’s middle-school graduation.
When he came back the next day, he found that the board had pulled a coup: they informed him they weren’t doing the deal, and it wasn’t up for discussion.
For Ballmer, it seems, the unforgivable thing was that Gates had been part of the coup, which Ballmer saw as the ultimate betrayal.
Ballmer erupted in a fit of rage.
He told the board in no uncertain terms that if they didn’t approve the Nokia deal he was out.
That was my best idea,” he says today.
The board told Ballmer they wanted him to stay, he says, and they did eventually agree to a slightly different version of the deal.
2 billion.
Why?
The board finally realized the downside: without Nokia, Microsoft was effectively done in the smartphone business.
But, for Ballmer, the damage was done, in more ways than one.
O.
The feeling was mutual.
As a source close to Microsoft says, no one, including Gates, tried to stop him from quitting.
Now, what ranks among the tech world’s most famous partnerships, and a deep friendship, may be at an end.
He didn’t mention Gates.
Like all great romances, the last chapter hasn’t been written,” says someone who knows both men.
Maybe it hasn’t—but now there’s nothing to force them back together.
O.
Disagreement over whether or not an outsider was needed.
O.
And the incredible difficulty of finding a person who both could and would want to run Microsoft.
O.
Ford, who is regarded as a turnaround expert.
But Mulally felt that he should not be required to go through a formal process of interviewing for the job, according to several sources, and the board began to have doubts.
It wasn’t until January that Mulally formally announced that he would stay at Ford, but sources say he had been out of the running for a long time before that.
O.
Another potential candidate was Paul Maritz, a former top Microsoft executive who had gone on to key jobs at other technology companies.
But in ex-Microsoft circles, the story is that Maritz felt that Microsoft was too far behind in too many critical battles, and would have to slim down and make choices.
When Gates disagreed, Maritz concluded he wouldn’t have the freedom to do what he wanted.
As the search wore on, the stress increased.
I’m not sure there was disagreement about any one thing,” says a close observer.
I think it got competitive .
Bill can’t stand losing.
O.
Symantec, wanted the job.
Gates said, with some emotion, that he would not support Thompson, and that Nadella would be a better pick.
O.
But eventually Nadella emerged as the top internal candidate.
There were still some on the board who wanted to bring in an outsider.
O.
Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson, was under consideration—but Vestberg kept delaying meetings, and some on the board concluded that he wasn’t that interested in the job.
At a meeting on January 19, the board finally decided on Nadella.
In the end, “they all agreed on the one thing that mattered,” says a source close to the board.
Bill Gates would step down as chairman of the board.
The new chair would be John Thompson.
He  used up his chips with these people” is how one close observer sums up the situation.
The funny thing is that Gates, who has been passionately committed to his foundation, didn’t step away from his former company.
Instead he decided to step back in.
Not for roughly one-third of his time, Gates says.
We say 30 percent,” he corrects.
He deeply believes he can bring something to Microsoft that no one else can,” says someone who knows him well.
Will Steve Ballmer go quietly?
He did go, but it remains to be seen how quiet he’ll be.
He says he has seven big things he’s doing, including learning Hebrew, getting in shape, figuring out his civic duties, running the Clippers—and managing his stake in Microsoft, which he says is 65 to 70 percent of his net worth.
He has no intention of selling, partly out of loyalty and partly because he thinks that Microsoft is a good investment.
I want to be a good shareholder,” he says.
At the same time, he says he’s very conscious of the lessons of the past.
He’s met with Nadella a few times but always off the Microsoft campus.
It’s not like I have an allergic reaction ,” he says.
That’s how Nadella, who is just 47 years old, began his remarks at a March Microsoft retreat, where he spoke to the company’s top 100 or so executives for the first time about his worldview, about his view of Microsoft, and about the path forward.
One longtime executive was struck by Nadella’s balance.
He is intense without being intimidating,” this person says.
But this person was most struck by what Nadella didn’t do.
It would have been so easy to throw the previous administration under the bus,” he says.
Nadella, despite his long career at Microsoft—and his similarities to Gates—is in fundamental ways a break from the past.
He has had his executive team read Nonviolent Communication.
He’s a genuinely nice person, with a wide smile that cannot be faked.
He is liked by people who have worked for him, by his peers, and by those who were above him.
Everyone likes Satya,” says one former Microsoft executive.
You cannot dislike Satya.
Bill loves him.
Steve loves him.
You want to get behind him,” says Greg Sullivan, who is the director of the Windows Phone division.
Gates does now or than Ballmer ever did.
C.
Mac, Nadella would play the Mac.
He is fit, with closely cropped hair.
He wears black-rimmed glasses and has even been seen in a hoodie.
In his short tenure, he has already used a metaphor with overtones of Zen to explain to the troops what he wants  “a team of rowers working together at the highest level” .
He actually talks to people outside the company, from competitors to venture capitalists.
This is unusual in a company that people describe as insular.
You talk about the rise and fall of empires or families or anything; being insular is the best way to sort of kill yourself,” says Nadella.
One ex-Microsoft executive who was not a fan of the company’s old corporate culture says, “He’s obviously a Microsoft loyalist.
He quotes Nietzsche and other philosophers, but his real love is poetry, because “poets can take perhaps any philosophical point or any point of life and can compress it into a few lines,” he says.
T.
S.
Eliot and Keats are among his favorite poets, and he also enjoys Urdu poetry.
Growing up in India, once you started engineering school you really don’t have any liberal-arts education,” he says.
Somehow I got hooked onto saying, Look, the one good way to renew yourself is to read good literature and good poetry .
Nadella was born in Hyderabad, India.
His childhood was an exercise in managing dissonance.
My mom was a professor of Sanskrit, and my dad was a Marxist economist.
They were two very contrasting personalities,” he says.
They had their ideological wars, and I got to ignore both of them.
A.
University of Chicago’s Booth School.
When he first arrived at Microsoft, in 1992, he worked on the business side, helping to oversee Office, and then ran research and development for the company’s online services, which included the troubled search engine, Bing.
After taking over that business, he became the head of something called Server and Tools, which sold Windows-based software and services to help big corporations manage their technology needs, in early 2011.
That made him one of five executives reporting directly to Ballmer.
The new world of computing is a radical break from the past.
That’s because of the growth of mobile devices and cloud computing.
Window servers in their own facilities, with the necessary software installed on them.
Everyone used Windows, so everything was developed for Windows.
It was a virtuous circle for Microsoft.
Now the processing power is in the cloud, and very sophisticated applications, from e-mail to tools you need to run a business, can be run by logging onto a Web site, not from pre-installed software.
Android and Apple’s iOS each outsell Windows by more than 10 to 1.
Why develop software to run on Windows if no one is using Windows?
Why use Windows if nothing you want can run on it?
The virtuous circle has turned vicious.
Part of why Microsoft failed with devices is that competitors upended its business model.
Google doesn’t charge for the operating system.
That’s because Google makes its money on search.
Apple can charge high prices because of the beauty and elegance of its devices, where the software and hardware are integrated in one gorgeous package.
Meanwhile, Microsoft continued to force outside manufacturers, whose products simply weren’t as compelling as Apple’s, to pay for a license for Windows.
And it didn’t allow Office to be used on non-Windows phones and tablets.
The whole philosophy of the company was Windows first,” says Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Of course it was: that’s how Microsoft had always made its money.
Nadella lived this dilemma because his job at Microsoft included figuring out the cloud-based future while maintaining the highly profitable Windows server business.
And so he did a bunch of things that were totally un-Microsoft-like.
He went to talk to start-ups to find out why they weren’t using Microsoft.
He put massive research-and-development dollars behind Azure, a cloud-based platform that Microsoft had developed in Skunk Works fashion, which by definition took resources away from the highly profitable existing business.
Very gutsy” is how Marco Iansiti, a Harvard Business School professor who wrote case studies about Nadella, describes these moves.
At its core, Azure uses Windows server technology.
That helps existing Windows applications run seamlessly on Azure.
Technologists sometimes call what Microsoft has done a “hybrid cloud” because companies can use Azure alongside their pre-existing on-site Windows servers.
At the same time, Nadella also to some extent has embraced open-source software—free code that doesn’t require a license from Microsoft—so that someone could develop something using non-Microsoft technology, and it would run on Azure.
That broadens Azure’s appeal.
Holding our breath until we turn blue is not going to change the world” is how a former Microsoft executive sums up Nadella’s moves.
It’s not the world we wished it were, or the world we thought it was.
As one explains it to me, life under Ballmer, and to some extent even Gates, was “‘Let’s get on I-90 and drive to Hawaii!
They say, ‘Yes, you can!
It’ll be great!
The holy grail for Microsoft would be getting developers to write new software for Windows again, putting Windows back at the center of a new virtuous circle.
But it’s hard to see a path from here to there.
Windows device.
And if Microsoft develops a new killer application, it almost has to be released for Android and Apple phones, given their market dominance, thereby strengthening those eco-systems, too.
Nadella announced that Microsoft would offer Office for Apple’s iPad.
A team at the company had been working on it for about a year.
Ballmer says he would have released it eventually, but Nadella did it immediately.
Nadella also announced that Windows would be free for devices smaller than nine inches, meaning phones and small tablets.
Now that we have 30 million users on the iPad using it, that is 30 million people who never used Office before ” he says.
These are small moves in some ways, and yet they are also big.
It’s the first time I have listened to a senior Microsoft executive admit that they are behind,” says one institutional investor.
I’m pretty excited about what’s going on in Office,” says Gates, who describes his new role at Microsoft as “way more intense” than his old role as board chairman.
The open-mindedness to some new things is there.
If the Gordian knots that lie ahead faze Gates at all, he doesn’t show it.
He says his next meeting is with “one of the genius guys who’s really pushing this idea that when you write an application you don’t write an application for this thing and then another application for that thing and another application for this thing.
His idea is that once you’ve launched—call it Meeting Room Plus—you can do everything that needs to be done, from sharing notes to videoconferencing, without having to pause to open something else up.
On that one, I think we’ll take the lead,” says Gates.
I think that’s a great way to think about it,” says Nadella.
Let’s say we walk into this room.
So far, in Wall Street’s eyes, Nadella can do no wrong.
87 billion.
It’s interesting with Satya,” says one person who observes him with investors.
But the honeymoon is the easy part.
5 billion.
Dave Pell, an investor who writes a newsletter called Next Draft.
Indeed.
Although fans are worried Microsoft will mess up their game, the deal gets Microsoft access to a whole generation that didn’t even know the company existed.
And, in another sign of change at Microsoft, the company says it’s committed to keeping Minecraft available not just on its own devices, but on all platforms, from Android to iOS to Sony’s PlayStation.
Nadella has also presided over some changes to the board, replacing three longtime members with fresh faces, and adding a new seat.
But as well respected and well liked as Nadella is—and as different as his style is from Ballmer’s or Gates’s—there are still questions about how radically different his Microsoft will be.
Within the company, it has almost become a cliché that he was the “safe pick”: that he will stick with the status quo, whether in keeping the consumer businesses or in reshaping Microsoft’s executive ranks, which, as several people point out to me, are filled with employees who thrived under Ballmer.
He’s not Genghis Khan when you might need Genghis Khan,” says another former Microsoft executive about Nadella.
There’s a Game of Thrones- like feeling inside Microsoft right now as people wait to see who will stay and who will go.
But most of Ballmer’s senior executives still have their jobs.
The biggest question of all, though, is what Bill Gates’s resumed presence at Microsoft means.
Can he add value, given his age and how long he’s been away from the technology world?
On this, Ballmer has another piece of advice for his successor.
Satya needs to be in control,” he says.
Gates and Nadella are sanguine about this.
When you say, ‘Well, Bill’s going to review something,’or ‘We’re going to have a discussion with Bill on something,’the energy it creates is just not replicable,” says Nadella.
I mean, you’ve got to just accept the fact that the founder has a different class, a different status.
And, quite honestly, I want to take advantage of that.
He says that he has learned from his experience with Ballmer, and from running his foundation, that he does “not have the full picture.
So I get to give input.
The thing you’ve got to remember is I grew up in a Microsoft where Bill and Steve were there,” says Nadella.
Obviously, it is too soon to tell how this will all work, at least in part because Nadella is, probably deliberately, not an easy person to read.
Take his recent decision to lay off 18,000 employees, most of them from the newly acquired Nokia.
While he says it is just the normal aftermath of a big acquisition, others see it as a much broader dismantling of Ballmer’s broad strategy to move into hardware.
When I ask Nadella if he’s capable of being Genghis Khan, he ducks the question.
Of course that’s true.
In the next few years, we’ll know if that chapter is celebratory—or a cautionary tale.

I was ecstatic to find Michael Palermo and Jeremy Foster’s Jump Start covering that exam.
I loved the way they taught the course; I was able to understand all the material and loved the pace of the course, as every module was thorough and fun to follow along.
This was my first video course.
For me the trick was two monitors and learning how to pause often!
The HTML5 and CSS3 course was excellent!
Bob s pace is perfect, he sticks to the material pertinent and has an  easy to listen to  voice.
I ve been a C# developer for years now but have decided that I really was missing a trick by not knowing Javascript, so I am actively trying to address that right now.
This course was exactly what I needed.
Fast paced, enthusiastic and fun!
Thanks!

A employee stands in the Microsoft booth during the 2014 Computex exhibition at the TWTC Nangang exhibition hall in Taipei June 3, 2014.
SEATTLE  Reuters  - Microsoft’s impending purchase of Mojang, the Swedish developer with 100 million players of its open world Minecraft game, is more aimed at pulling users onto the software company s obscure mobile platform than its better known PC system or Xbox game console.
5 percent of the world s smartphone market, and its Surface tablet barely more, according to tech research firm IDC.
Growth is hampered because many app and game developers ignore it.
O  Android systems.
5 billion deal to buy its owner on Monday, according to a source briefed on the matter.
Dave Bisceglia, Chief Executive of independent game studio Tap Lab.
Microsoft does not disclose numbers of users of Windows Phones, and declined comment on the deal.
Minecraft was launched five years ago as a PC game, but 54 million sales later, about 40 percent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets.
Left to their own devices, it does not seem likely that Mojang s 40-strong team would ever get round to designing a Windows Phone version of Minecraft.
Markus Persson, the game s creator and co-founder of Mojang, said last year that Windows phones are so insignificant in terms of market share that they are not worth developing for.
Persson wrote in an email to Reuters last June, when asked why his company only made mobile versions of its games for iOS and Android, but not Windows Phone.
Persson, referring to Nokia s discontinued operating system and the fading Canadian smartphone pioneer.
Wall Street is focused on the mobile benefits for Microsoft.
Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund in a note to clients this week.
5 billion for Mojang, or about 8 times sales last year.
That is small change for Microsoft, which has $86 billion in cash and short-term investments.
But it is relatively large and expensive for game company acquisitions, which do not have a stellar record of success.
5 times projected annual sales.
O  $750 million acquisition of PopCap in 2011 was valued around 10 to 11 times sales.

On the other hand, Terraria, the “other Minecraft” had it’s Windows Phone version released today.
This won’t drive Minecraft players to buy Windows phones.
However, if they did restrict the mobile and tablet platforms the game is available on, they Would end up leaving Minecraft all together.
Also, for players who like to do online server play, many of them have more than one account.
Although once the game or account is bought, there is  at the moment  no more money coming in from the player, the potential for current players to continue buying full, supplemental accounts could be an actual loss for Microsoft, considering most people buy the smartphone version after playing the console or PC version.
They would really be cutting their nose off to spite their face if they restricted the platforms that the game is available on.
This discussion is now closed.
We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication.

I purchased the newest version of Office back in late August because I was going back to school to pursue a degree in interventional medicine.
I really loved the practicality of using onedrive to easily transfer homework lecture slides etc.
Pad.
But there seems to be a few key errors in either the onedrive system or in the coding of ms-word s phone app.
This making it essentially useless for my purposes.
So overall, it s useful in a few ways but the disappointments are pretty crucial ones.
Please keep improving it.

Straight from the source, the latest news and updates on Microsoft Ventures.
Minecraft is one of the most popular video games of all time, with more than 100 million downloads, on PC alone, from players since its launch in 2009.
Minecraft inspires millions to create together, connects people across the globe, and is a community that is among the most active and passionate in the world.
Our relationship with Mojang began when we initially talked to the team about bringing Minecraft to the console.
Minecraft quickly became the top online game on Xbox Live, with over two billion hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years.
That working relationship set the ground work for other opportunities.
We’ve long seen the incredible potential of Minecraft.
At Microsoft, we believe in the power of content to unite people.
Minecraft adds diversity to our game portfolio and helps us reach new gamers across multiple platforms.
Gaming is the top activity across devices and we see great potential to continue to grow the Minecraft community and nurture the franchise.
That is why we plan to continue to make Minecraft available across platforms – including iOS, Android and PlayStation, in addition to Xbox and PC.
The Minecraft community is passionate and diverse, ranging across all ages and demographics.
We respect the brand and independent spirit that has made Minecraft great, and we’ll carry on the tradition of innovation to move the franchise forward.
Our investments in cloud, Xbox Live and mobile technology will enable players to benefit from richer and faster worlds, more powerful development tools, and more opportunities to connect with the Minecraft community.
We’re excited to confirm that MINECON will continue next year.
We’ll look to create even more ways for the vibrant community of YouTuber’s, innovators, bloggers and players to connect with each other – both in person and online.
We will have much more to share in the coming months.
The Minecraft team’s unique vision, creative energy and innovative mindset make them a perfect fit alongside our other global studios.
Microsoft Studios includes 343 Industries, Turn 10 Studios, and Lionhead Studios just to name a few.
These industry-leading game studios within Microsoft that have had great success with beloved games and massively popular franchises like Halo, Forza, and Fable.
We’re excited to welcome Mojang to the Microsoft family and we are thrilled to support the success and longevity of Minecraft for years to come.

Summary: Microsoft Research s Silicon Valley, with about 50 employees, is one of the casualties of Microsoft s latest round of 2,100 job cuts.
One of the casualties of the latest round of job cuts at Microsoft is the Microsoft Research  MSR  Silicon Valley lab.
On September 18, Microsoft officials acknowledged the company would be cutting 2,100 jobs across the company worldwide as part of the previously announced layoffs of 18,000 disclosed in July 2014.
Of today s cuts, 747 are in the Washington state area, and 160 total in California, a Microsoft spokesperson said.
The MSR Silicon Valley lab is primarily focused on distributed computing research, including  privacy, security, protocols, fault-tolerance, large-scale systems, concurrency, computer architecture, Internet search and services, and related theory,  according to the web page for the lab.
MSR Silicon Valley is managed by Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Roy Levin.
Microsoft operates a number of Microsoft Research labs worldwide, including labs in Asia, Cairo, Cambridge  UK , Europe, India, Israel New England, New York City and Redmond.
He said the cuts today do not mean Microsoft is backing away from its research commitments or necessarily closing any of the research projects that are run out of the Silicon Valley lab.
Anyhow, some of them are being moved to the other labs.
But that was in the article also, and I didn t want to have to cut and past the whole article into the comment section just so he d read it.
Microsoft Research labs.
Microsoft Research labs.
To me it sounds like they re just cutting fat but will probably keep the work they re doing.
I guess you didn t read the article though.
Consolidation could be a good thing.
They did it within Microsoft bringing together the Windows team with Windows Phone and Xbox.
This is just a way to get their West Coast teams together under one roof.
Is that such a bad thing?
Research is also reliant upon networking with other Tech firms and brains in coffee shops in the valley.
Seems a bit stupid to my mind, when Microsoft Research seem to be one of only a few parts of the company at bringing some really great products and Apps into the Microsoft Portfolio.
Microsoft are really poor at bringing the Microsoft Research teams ideas into market.
I guess they just claim patents.
Downhill all the way.
Keep up the good work badmouthing Microsoft, maybe apple will give you some crumbs  then again probably not .
Its true Microsoft hasn t brought a lot of their ideas to market, but a lot of the ideas they ve come up with have been years ahead of their time and either the technology isn t here yet or it would cost to much for the every day consumer to buy.
The Perspective Pixel monitor is just now going down in price and still to expensive for consumers and even small businesses.
I think what Microsoft is going to try and do is bring more stuff to market and see what sticks.
It works for Google.
I believe they see to compete with Google they have to do this.
We see the start of this with the Surface tablets and we ll see more.
Its not about collecting patents, they re not apple.
I think instead of competing with Google and apple in the portable market they re going to compete with them on IOT  Internet of things  area that is new, ripe and ready.
They ll continue to make strides in tablets and phones for consumers, but IOT is where the money is going to be.
I think making Windows Phone free to OEM s and the possibility of making Windows 8 free for consumers is them saying they re betting they ll make money another way and that s with Office 365, and IOT, and their apps on other mobile OS .
Windows and Windows Phone isn t going to be Microsofts biggest revenue anymore, actually they ll be happy to come out even as long as they can make up that money in other ways.
Perspective Pixel  was not a Microsoft research Project they bought out Pixel.
If you want to compete with  More Stuff  like Google, then you need more Research.
IOT is not a product out of Microsoft Research either, nor are their Phone and Tablet lines.
My observation was that it is stupid to close down Research Centre, sited in Silicon Valley, where cross collaboration on technology is so apparent.
5 Million Downloads across my Windows hone Apps.
I think there is a fundamental principle behind industrial research labs that they have to contribute to the main product of the company.
The corporate honchos ultimately care about how much immediate value is created by a research lab.
Back in the early 2000s similar things happened with AT&T research, NEC labs and Compaq s Cambridge labs.
It is imperative to have the product relevance in mind when working for a for profit company.

The apps have the robust capabilities and familiar look and feel that is unmistakably Office, while offering a fantastic touch experience built from the ground up for iPad.
With the free versions of the apps, you can read your Word documents, view your Excel data and present with PowerPoint.
Your documents will look as good as they do on your PC and Mac®, and better than ever on your iPad.
With an Office 365 subscription, you can edit and create new documents with the iPad.
When you edit a document, you can be sure that content and formatting will be maintained across Office on PC, Mac, tablet and phone.
And, you always have access to your up-to-date documents in OneDrive and OneDrive for Business.
With one subscription all of your devices are covered, so you can work the way you want.
Office Mobile is available in the App Store and Google Play .
Office documents look better than ever on iPad.
They look just as they do on your PC or Mac.
In Word, images, tables, SmartArt, footnotes, equations are all there, perfectly formatted.
Formulas, charts, sparklines, conditional formatting, and filters in Excel help you make better decisions.
PowerPoint presentations pack a punch with transitions, animations, speaker notes and much more.
When presenting, you can even use a built-in laser pointer, pens and highlighters to get your point across.
A familiar Office experience designed for iPad.
What makes these apps unique is that they strike just the right balance between being unmistakably Office and being designed for the iPad.
If you use Office on a PC or Mac, the iPad apps feel very familiar, so you are comfortable and confident using these apps right away.
The Ribbon layout and experience is familiar, with the most common commands under Home, and Chart commands automatically show up when you select a chart.
At the same time, these apps were created from the ground up for iPad.
The large touch areas on the Ribbon and in overlay menus make it simple to create, edit and format documents using only touch.
Resize and rotate objects like pictures with touch-friendly handles.
When you hold and move the objects, text flows smoothly around them.
No keyboard and mouse required.
You can even use iPad features like voice dictation to draft a Word document or AirPlay® to project a presentation wirelessly on a TV screen.
Edit, create and collaborate with confidence.
When you edit documents with the Office for iPad apps, you can be sure that you won’t lose any content or formatting.
Documents will look exactly how you intended in Office on PC, Mac, tablet and phone – regardless of which device you used to make the edits.
Moreover, the apps have a remarkably rich feature set to create beautifully designed documents.
In addition, the apps make it easy to work together.
Word documents can track changes, have threaded comments and easily accept or reject edits all right on the iPad.
Made for the cloud and Office 365.
Since people want to be able to get things done everywhere, the apps are seamlessly integrated with Microsoft’s cloud services.
The apps let you access up-to-date documents in OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.
It’s easy to pick up from where you left off, because the apps know what documents you were working on last, no matter what device you were using.
Even if you don’t have an Internet connection for a while, you’ll still be able to work on the documents you’ve recently used on the iPad.
Q: How much does Office for iPad cost?
To get the full editing and creation experience, you need an Office 365 subscription.
Office 365 gives you always-up-to-date versions of Office across your PC, Mac and iPad, and much more.

S.
In order to use the Office, I have to create either hotmail or live for it?
Yes, the new iPad Office app works with Office 365.
I have a student subscription to 365 but my student email is not linked to my iPad Apple ID so it won’t let me register.
I have tried 3 separate support calls and no one can help.
Anyone have a solution?
When I first opened Word for the iPad, it came up with a wizard that it wanted me to step through.
Choose the option that says view for free, then you will see the shopping cart icon in the lower left hand corner.
From there, you will get the option to enter your credentials for an existing Office 365 account.
Once I entered my credentials there, it actually activated my Word, Excel, and Powerpoint installations so I only had to do it the once in Word.
Honestly I was really looking forward to have Office on my iPad.
Office for Mac for 270€ I shall pay another 100€  year to be able to edit my document on my iPad?
What about an in app purchase to enable editing without an Office 365 subscription?
But here’s the disappointing thing.
You have to go up the subscription levels to get multi-factor authentication.
MFA is pretty much standard in any decent web service – Google Apps, Evernote, Dropbox to name three obvious competitors.
Why isn’t this kind of basic security pervasive throughout Microsoft rather than being a sell-up option?
It is good to see that MSFT has finally created   released this for the iPad.
I have already heard several users here at work now saying there is no reason not to support or use iPads at work.
As I also already had a subscription to Office 365, it was not at all clear how I could get my subscription to work with the new apps.
But, I figured it out.
As to the comment from the user with a Surface Pro 2, you are meant to use the full blown version of MS Office.
That is why the Surface Pro 2 can run full and actual Windows Apps.
That is also why the Surface and Surface 2 do come with their Office apps as part of the package so no one is getting messed over here.
Except maybe those on Android tablets.
So why should a surface pro 2 not have a touch version of office?
Yes we can use the normal office but sometimes an interface designed for touch is better.
For example the touch onenote app is more useful for note taking etc.
Hi ruzzy, I am Guy and I am a product manager for Office on tablets and phones.
Office 2013 on Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 are a solid combination.
When you use the Surface with an attachable keyboard and mouse, you can use the full feature set of Office as you would on a laptop.
You can use Office side by side with other applications, attach additional monitors and other peripherals.
When you use Surface as a tablet, the Office UI adjusts and becomes touch-friendly.
And you can use the Surface Pro 2 pen to write on Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents.
Surface users have been very happy with Office on their devices.
While yesterday’s news was about giving our customers a great Office experience on iPads, we are committed as ever to continue to innovate on Windows and bring touch-first Office apps to Windows tablets.
I signed up for the Office 365 small business trial… but of course my iPad is telling me “Cannot Activate:  This account doesn’t have a paid Office 365 subscription.
Not all is well yet with this obviously….
Apparently the Office Small Business Premium trial doesn’t work with the iPad apps, but the Home version does.
Go figure.
I signed up for the home one on top of the business one and it started working.
Seems a bit odd, since my P1 Exchange Online plan won’t let me add a Home subscription.
Microsoft – you are doing the right thing with Office for iPad and Mac, but you gotta learn to slim down your license and subscription models.
Subscription based!
I was looking forward to this release.
HUGE disappointment.
As a math teacher I needed to create equations in document.
No such option to insert equation.
I created my equations in MyScript Calculator  iPad app  and simply copied and paste into my Word doc.
Works for me!
It looks great – now, I really want this as my Surface version of Office.
I was like I couldn’t wait to have it on my iPad.
At the first time I got in, I didn’t understand Apple ID subscription for Office 365 then I switched to my Office 365 account.
From now onwards I don’t have to bring any cumbersome machines when traveling and presenting.
Information technology has changed so fast.
I’m able to open a word document from another into the new office word app, but not vice versa?
Why I’m not able to  open the word document I created in another app like dropbox, printer or custom mail application?
I have an MSDN Subscription, and have activated my Office365 entitlement, which gives me ‘Microsoft Office 365 Enterprise E3 Developer  MSDN  1 Licenses’ but neither the user I setup using the Office365 registration process or my MSDN Microsoft ID allows me to use the iPad apps.
Even with the subscription?
If I can’t print to my wireless printer, of what use is this version?
Two ways to print.
Send your self a copy via email to Apples Mail app, print from there.
I agree, there should be a print option in Office iPad apps.
Maybe printers are going to way of CDs and DVDs?
Sure hope not.
Still have folks who send pix & stuff I’d like to see in print.
Pages on my iPad.
Works ok, for most of what I do.
But thanks!
I have a business subscription to 365  A3  but my iPad is telling me “Cannot Activate: This account doesn’t have a paid Office 365 subscription.
Try a different Microsoft account, or buy an Office 365 Home subscription”; In my iPhone the office app works with that subscription… Why iPad don’t ?
Hi Danguita, I am Guy and work for Microsoft.
Do you still have the same issue?
You should be able activate the Office apps with your Office 365 A3 account.
I’ve been waiting for these products for years  especially Excel … but I’m not going to pay $10 a month in perpetuity to use them… pretty disappointing.
I wonder how many users Office will not convert because of the pricing structure?
Hi blue, I am Guy Gilbert and am a product manager for Office.
The trial also includes the latest versions of Office for PC and Mac.
99 per month includes Office on 5 PCs or Macs and 5 tablets, which is interesting for families.
99 per month.
If you happen to be a student, there are even more affordable options available.
Hope that helps.
Thanks for the response Guy… My problem is that I have MS Office that I previously purchased on my home computer and my work computer has MS Office provided by my employer.
So, I only need Office on my iPad  and maybe my wife’s iPad .
Compared to other solutions, $10 a month is just too expensive for a product that I’ll only use on two iPads.
Hi Guy, I am with Blue here…I already have paid licenses for 2 Win and 1 Mac laptops.
Why should I pay yet again for 365 just to use the apps on my IPad?
Just doesn’t make sense cents.
All the more reason why I am using Google cloud based apps now.
You guys are going to have to do more to catch up if you want to keep us as customers.
My entire 5000+ empl organization is moving to Google this month to replace Exchange.
The writing is on the wall for Office.
Hi, I downloaded the apps and subscribed to office 365 from in-app purchase of iPad.
However, when I am trying to login to office 365 in my mac, it is not accepting the sign-in.
I thought I could use the office apps in Mac based on my office 365 subscription from iPad.
How do I do that?
Do I need to download any applications at my Mac?
Thank you for downloading the apps and subscribing to Office 365.
Office 365.
You will land on your account page and you’ll be able to install Office for Mac from that page.
I have the apps on my iPad now and a year’s subscription.
I’m very disappointed that I cannot access my Dropbox files through these applications.
I have decades of files in Dropbox and have to refer to them regularly.
The only way that I can do this now is by e-mailing individual files to myself which is simply not workable on a regular basis.
I know that Office 365 comes with its own cloud-based service, which probably works well, but there is no way for many people like me who have been using Dropbox as a central hub for working on documents across multiple devices to get true functionality out of these applications unless you can build Dropbox access into them.
Until you can offer that, these applications are going to be of very limited use and hard to recommend.
Thanks for listening.
Same here, long time MS supporter.
365 early adapter… excited to finally enjoy office apps on ipad  which is what office 365 misleadingly promised a while ago with a half baked ipad app … and still can’t enjoy the functionality on a practical level because I am heavily invested in dropbox… which in my opinion, is a superior and more universally accepted cloud solution than onedrive.
I installed the apps on my iPad, performed the in app purchase for Office 365 Home and all worked well.
365 Home on my laptop  which also worked well .
One critical feature that is still missing from an otherwise great product is outline view.
It would be wonderful to be able to effortlessly navigate large documents by, say, swiping left to right to open an outline view containing multiple heading levels.
This would be useful in other products too, especially OneNote, where in the current version if you have more than ten or so tabs  sections  in a workbook you have to swipe right to left to go through them, and the new section control  plus sign  doesn’t show up until you get to the end.
I’m trying to write a novel with 50-some chapters, and the iPad’s lack of this feature is all that is keeping me tethered to a netbook with an old version of Word running on Windows 7.
Thank you for the suggestions, kosterkamp.
I came up with a workaround involving a table of contents at the beginning of the document, in combination with a little known touch gesture .
Let me know if you’re interested.
Guy Gilbert – Office for iPad Product Manager.
I also have an issue concerning dropbox.
I’m afraid it isn’t feasible, even if I wanted to, to disentangle my life from dropbox right now.
It is on everything.
And it is what enables connection with many ipad apps which know nothing of onedrive.
Is there *any* way I can combine dropbox with Office for iPad?
83 for a 1 year app.
99 range and you may have a better response.
I am a little frustrated right now.
I have a P1 Subscription  more than a home sub  yet it is not allowed as part of this for full user, while all others seem to be.
This does need to be corrected.
If I add more licenses to my P1, the cost per year will be way more than even the Home sub.
Microsoft, please allow a P1 subscriptions.
I can download office and other tools to my laptop and use your tools on phones and tablets but you restrict me from using it on an iPad.
I have Offce365 Small Business and it should be included.
Any hope for help with Dropbox, which seems a common concern?
Guy?
Bueller?
I have onebox inside Dropbox now, but with onebox only on one machine to avoid sync wars.
Is this safe?
Also, round trip editing in word 2003 for windows, with compatibility pack, saving docx still requires a conversion for ipad editing.
Any ideas?
PowerPoint for iPad is so disappointing.
I am mystified how this product cannot support video or audio and has no way to add or edit animation.
Hi John, thanks to MS that you came along with this solution!
A great add-on to my E3 subscription!
Two things I have problems with.
1.
I have some troubles with the access to files.
I edit and save a document on the laptop  OneDrive , but can not access it again via Word for IPad.
If I open it via the OneDrive for IPad app it’s working proper.
The login account  IPad Word  is a E3 account.
Is this still not supported to have a private and a company account?
2.
Account  user  image is not shown, when logging on with the E3 account to IPad Word.
Will you fix this?
Hi Fritz, I am a product manager for Office for iPad.
Great to hear you like the new add-on to your O365 subscription.
1.
And you should see documents from both in your list of recent documents.
Pad app?
2.
Thanks for bringing that to our attention.
We will look into it.
I have an MS Word document with an 3rd party word app linked to it.
I can use that word app on Word 2013 desktop edition.
Is this supported to work in the iPAD native app as well?
I tested the latest iPAD native app but couldn’t find the option to insert a word app or use the one linked with my uploaded word document.
If not then is it in the road map?
Because of my employer, I paid for a “Home Use Program” license for Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013  valid for installation on two PC’s .
I also have an iPad and I installed your new OneNote and PowerPoint – though I thank you for making OneNote fully usable with just an msn or live MS account, I can only VIEW in PowerPoint because I am not an Office365 subscriber.
I ask that you would please enable iPad office editing for those of us who already purchased Office 2013 through the HUP.
There is no reason for us to purchase the full suite twice.
Thanks!
I also purchased the HUP and don’t understand the need to purchase a monthly subscription for something I already own a full license for.
It would be convenient to use office on my iPad but not worth the extra cost.
This pricing plan is great for someone who doesn’t have office at all  as long as the program automatically updates on all devices for as long as you have the subscription .
Why has no one from Microsoft answered any of the concerns from individuals who already own licensed copies of office 2013?
Is there any concern with keeping loyal customers?
I am seriously considering the google products since Microsoft doesn’t seem inclined with answering or addressing these concerns from their customers.
Mr.
I can understand locking users into OneDrive under the free model, but when paid Office 365 subscribers can’t save files to Dropbox with these apps…wow, just, wow.
Add that support and these apps will be a home run; otherwise they’re still just little league.
All this support for Office 365 but not for the companies that spend 100,000’s of thousands of dollars in VLK licensing for 2013 office and software assurance.
Sure makes me think about using Google docs and ditching office across the entire company when you screw over your highest paying loyal customers with this garbage.
I was very excited about this announcement, and I’m more impressed than I thought I would be with Excel for iPad.
It supports a lot of important features including data validation and conditional formatting  features lacking in Excel for iPhone .
I’ve only tested a few of my spreadsheets in Excel for iPad, but I like what I’m seeing so far.
I can finally be done with using the Numbers app on the iPad!
It is SO much easier to just create XLSX files and have them work on whatever device I happen to be using.
The integration with OneDrive is superb.
One thing that I would really like to see is the ability to drag a row to a new location, or at least when you Cut a row and then select another row and choose Insert Above, it should insert the row you just Cut.
What is the best place to look for support around these products?
We’ve installed on several devices in our environment and none can ‘Share’ a file either as a Link or E-mail directly from the device.
Thank you!
Why do the menu doesn’t appear on over the cell of my Excel for Ipad when I tap  on the cell, trying to copy the content to other cells?
It really function on my Ipad 3 but not on a Ipad 2.
This kind of features gives the new look to Apple I pod.
This feels like a big step towards the ‘digital workplace’.
With SharePoint in the cloud, or secure access to SharePoint via the internal network or VPN, I can do my Word editing   outline drafting wherever I am now, without the laptop.
I especially like how all the Microsoft apps on my iPad somehow share log-ins – once I was signed in to OneDrive, my account automatically appeared in Word – or did I dream that?
Magickal!
I guess some people will pay for a personal Office 365 account and then try to use it inside the enterprise.
Hi former team – Wondering about something and can’t find any info about this particular issue: : I bought Office 365 for my company and as I often use my iPad at work, I sintalled Office for iPad when it came out.
This Office 365 plan doesn’t incude editing.
If you need to edit,.
Obviously I’m not going to buy a subscription since we already have one  and pay plenty for it.
Does this indicate that enterprise subscribers can’t edit Office 365 apps for the iPad?
Is so, that’s kinda nutty… Thanks!
I just got my office 365 subscription and loving it.
However, I have one question about using Word on the IPAD.
Is there a way to turn on Smart Quotes while typing?
NOT EH ?
Holy BOD Batman ” !
I mean {wtf}… I work with Apple Numbers and it took forever to code in turning to ‘Landscape View’…but now this ?
Disappointing release.
I have been waiting and hoping for a microsoft word app for the ipad that is actually from microsoft.
I don’t even mind paying $99 a year to use the app if it works.
Unfortunately, without a easy print feature  because sometimes you still need to print  and dropbox functionality  because I need my files to no be bound up in a proprietary cloud platform  this app falls into the rest of the unhelpful and cumbersome word apps currently available.
If this changes I will buy if not…well I am not waiting with bated breath.
Another question: Office 2014 for mac is coming this year.
Did this include a version of VISIO and Project too?
Visio would be very great, there is no good alternative on mac.
Didi Office 2014 for mac include a version of VISIO and Project too?
Visio would be very great, there is no good alternative on mac.

We want to update all our loyal customers about the service outages that many of you are experiencing today.
It is not a technical issue.
This morning, Microsoft served a federal court order and seized 22 of our most commonly used domains because they claimed that some of the subdomains have been abused by creators of malware.
We were very surprised by this.
We have a long history of proactively working with other companies when cases of alleged malicious activity have been reported to us.
Unfortunately, Microsoft never contacted us or asked us to block any subdomains, even though we have an open line of communication with Microsoft corporate executives.
We have been in contact with Microsoft today.
They claim that their intent is to only filter out the known bad hostnames in each seized domain, while continuing to allow the good hostnames to resolve.
However, this is not happening.
Apparently, the Microsoft infrastructure is not able to handle the billions of queries from our customers.
Millions of innocent users are experiencing outages to their services because of Microsoft’s attempt to remediate hostnames associated with a few bad actors.
Had Microsoft contacted us, we could and would have taken immediate action.
Microsoft now claims that it just wants to get us to clean up our act, but its draconian actions have affected millions of innocent Internet users.
Vitalwerks and No­-IP have a very strict abuse policy.
Our abuse team is constantly working to keep the No-­IP system domains free of spam and malicious activity.
We use sophisticated filters and we scan our network daily for signs of malicious activity.
Even with such precautions, our free dynamic DNS service does occasionally fall prey to cyber scammers, spammers, and malware distributors.
But this heavy-handed action by Microsoft benefits no one.
We will do our best to resolve this problem quickly.
For over 14 years, No­-IP has been offering the best and most affordable Dynamic and Managed DNS solutions.
Our robust Anycast Network with points of presence in 18 different world­class facilities across the globe guarantees our 100% Uptime, because let’s face it, there are no upsides to downtime.
No­IP is the preferred choice for users on the Internet for dynamic DNS compared to smaller, less reliable alternatives.
Our DNS Experts will ensure that your website is fast, reliable and always available.
CUÁNDO CREEN QUE EL PROBLEMA ESTARÁ SOLUCIONADO.
Decisão arbitrária que está prejudicando de forma contundente todos os meus hosts, sendo que nada tenho a ver com esta política arbitrária da Microsoft.
Microsoft não vai nos ressarcir.
Bryan i completely agree to what you said.
Microsoft should be shut down for the same amount of time.
To interfere with a world wide network is not legal.
Microsoft have put themselves in a bad light and the ‘legal’ process that allowed this to happen in an even worse light.
They should also pay compensation for the loss of business that so many innocent people have incurred.
This is a very bad day for world freedom.
This is just another reason to dump microsoft, and move to linux as Jason as suggested.
Microsoft is a goliath, that refuses to take backtalk from anyone.
They have millions of faithful brainwashed windows supporters, who fall into line like lemmings.
This is outrageous, and an outrage that microsoft would sue a good company, and besmear their name simply because of ludicrous charges they probably cannot even fully prove.
Microsoft lost me as a customer about a year ago, and this just makes me realize how bad their company has become.
I hope someone on MS sees this thread and realizes they are polarizing people against them.
Soon, I hope they will lose people by the droves for their poor, incosiderate business practices.
This has nothing to do with the OS.
Do you think Windows would be able to handle the amount of traffic generated at No-Ip?
If it was possible, the domains would still be working.
In this case only some Unix Linux flavor can handle the service accordingly.
O dejaran sin vos a medio planeta.
Microsoft is the cause of all problems, No-IP is not.
If Windows wasn’t so bad and poorly written, none of this ever happened.
And don’t forget Hotmail and Live, they spam like no other service on the planet.
Microsoft sucks BIG TIME!
I´m a computer technician, and I so tired of how easily Windows is hijacked by malware.
Micro$oft never never took security seriously.
It is really a shame.
And continue working in your remote office.
What’s alternative now?
We are facing a big problem.
And continue working in your remote office.
You should have created your own DNS server for your DVR and Computer Repair customers.
Private Internal Use Only” that they understand that they will be able to see the cameras on their laptop, PC, Iphone, or Android when they are in their office or house connected to their own wireless router directly.
No need to access a 3rd party DNS for name resolution when they are at home – much more faster access time.
2  their ISP ip address “example: 96:55:12:253″ labeled as “For External Remote Access” with the understanding that this label is for use when they want to see the cameras when they are away from their office or house.
There I can use DDNS or plain simple IP address.
Recently, my DVR software maker has created their own DDNS service just for their DVR software and I have started using it, this qualifies as having your own private DDNS service, except that its being operated by the DVR software maker, maybe you should check to see if your DVR software maker hosts their own DNS server that you can use for your customers.
Most stand alone DVR comes with their own version of DVR, such as Q-SEE Q, etc I have seen.
I would suggest that you pay a courtesy visit for all of your customers and perform necessary changes based on the DNS choices available for the DVR.
If you build your own DVR  like I do  – PC based DVR, you will have infinite options at your disposal in how to remedy this dilemma, and you can consider obtaining a TeamViewer license for future “headaches” so you can be able to log in to your customer’s DVR to perform administrative duties when ever necessary.
How, he can just use his IP address for his email.
Or host his own DNS service using more free open source software.
Thanks, Microsoft, for taking THOUSANDS  if not more  of legitimate hostnames offline.
It’s not too much of a reach to say that my civil rights have been violated by this takedown.
Microsoft.
It seems to me that my business is being harmed through no fault of my own.
There has to be some ambulance chaser out there who would file a class action lawsuit on our behalf………….
Apparently, in the US you can sue for pretty much anything, if you can get a judge to hear your argument.
That is hijacking at the best, and blatent FRAUD at worst.
Now,  they are claiming some people are using no-ip to promote malware sites, well for years, I have been getting viruses and malware because of flaws in microsoft OS.
As well, Java Deployment Toolkit  click-to-play  has been blocked for your protection.
Yet has microsoft gotten a court order against Java?
Seems they tried THAT one in the past and got their fingers slapped.
I use my no-ip domain to connect to a private mumble server to do voip for gaming,  so because of microsoft action, I can not use this service.
This constitutes a denial of service attack directly against ME by microsoft.
If any class action suit is pursued,  I would be happy to add my name to it.
Who told you that once your Windows PC gets into a botnet you don’t get out.
You can get out as easily are removing the trojan horse responsible for joining your Windows box to the botnet.
Malwarebytes, Avast, etc and you can boot the windows pc off a Windows PE or Live Linux DVD and see what strange things you can find in c:\users\* where typically these trojan likes to place themselves and delete them aside from running malwarebytes, avast, etc too.
So, point here is that joining a botnet is not like joining a gang where once you join it there is not escape.
PC from a botnet.
Any chance of a link to the full text of the order?
First of all, if you remove ALL of Microsoft products from the earth, what do you have left Linux and Apple.
So ALL those people developping malware need a new platform to target, what do you think happens next?
I agreed!
A lot os services  profitable, legit and serious ones  are currently down!
Who’s going to pay for the downtimes   profit loses?
With this scenario, some people have the legal right to move court actions in order to protect their rights, and cover their loses!
With this Microsoft “draconian” action, NoIP can face court cases within a near future.
AHHHHH, FUCK OFF MICROSOFT!
You are drunk  as always !
Go home fix your crappy products!
A super profitable customer should be running their own DNS or having purchased their own domain name by now.
I would do to celebrate my success after the 1st month is purchase my own domain name and gradually move continue operations from thereon.
Hi.
And now what ?
I have a bunch of office brunches down…lot’s of cnames to no-ip domains and PROFESSIONAL and SERIOUS services are being afected.
Microsoft and hope this issue will sorted out very soon.
This is the equivalent of a whole street full of residents being arrested because a couple of households are breaking the law!
Any chance of a class action lawsuit to counter Microsoft’s actions?
Perhaps you should thank No-IP.
Legal action started on June 19th.
No-IP would have known this was coming and did nothing to warn customers.
Microsoft is a big target, but when was the last time someone secretly filed for a court order without the other party knowing anything about it.
Nobody should be shocked by what happened today.
Microsoft is one of the most despicable companies left in the world today – they spent their  career trying to exploit customers and reel in 80-90% of their profits off of just 2 programs in their massive lineup  windoze and office  and now that the world has  largely  abandoned BOTH of their platforms and been heading for clean waters and they’re left with an incredibly shrinking user base.
As a result of that they’ve been putting “their greatest minds” on things like this apparently – anything they can do to lie, cheat or steal their way to “the top”  which no longer exists for them  is on the table.
Isn’t is funny how many of us struggle constantly with Microsoft  created  problems on a daily basis yet their  former  CEO still maintains the spot of the richest person on the planet – one would think that title would be reserved for the people who changed the world on a positive note.
It just goes to show how this universe doesn’t reward good… it rewards greed.
On that note – has anyone ever wondered why Bill Gates is hell bent on giving away all his money through charity?
Quite frankly this is the mentality of these pricks – bully anyone you can when you have all the $$$.
Awe… poor Microsoft… as we all watch and wait for your ultimate demise, enjoy the ride down to the bottom… maybe you can sue some more people over Android patents when this action fails.
Revenue by any means necessary….
Why are Microsoft handling billions of queries from your customers?
They not a root level provider so why is this an issue?
Even if they blocked the domains in their own internal DNS servers, it may affect MS related services, like Hotmail, but it wouldn’t affect the entire Internet.
More clarity is needed on the exact issue and chain of events.
I appreciate the pain it’s causing.
However, people crying foul and wanting legal action need to calm down until the full and true facts are known  if that ever happens .
Sorry to hear of your troubles no-ip.
It is a classic bully boy tactic from over bloated corporate entity that has gotten toooo big.
Time to dump that POS Micro$oft OS in favour of Linux.
Scott H.
Ok, microsoft is really bad.
But please no-ip, Let us know wich domains we can use.
Because i’ve the paid account and I didn’t receive any information from you by mail and i had to be googling to check why some of my system didn’t work.
So please tell us wich domains we can use and wich we can’t!
You should post the complete list of domains seized by Microsoft.
How are we, the customers, supposed to tell if our hosts are affected or not?
A reputação da empresa fica abalada com esta acao da Micrisoft.
Are you aware of an alternate narrative because the one I’ve seen so far  which may be incorrect  suggests that Microsoft did not even attempt to engage with noip.
Collaboration happens all the time between companies and is more fruitful in the long term than simply bulldozing your way through.
This sets a dangerous precedent that if a company decides that another is not behaving in a way it agrees or if it merely states that while acting under an ulterior motive, then it can use it’s legal resources to attack them.
The same justification for this take down could be applied to many other companies including Microsoft, I’d sure like to get some Windows updates pushed that fix all bugs and design faults that virus writers have exploited over the years.
I’ve not asked them to fix them personally of course but I’ll go ahead and assume they’re in on it and justify myself under some bogus cyber cop manifesto.
I’m still in shock that something like this can be allowed to happen.
I mean penalising no-ip is one thing  not right  but to not consider the after effects on all the other millions of legitimate users and businesses… is just beyond me.
Microsoft and all parties involved in todays action against the no-ip free domains must be penalised for the simple fact of how many legitimate users and business have been affected by this action.
They also need to be held accountable and need to pay for the downtime and consequent loss of business for millions of others.
Deep down i think Microsoft and other parties involved will go unscaved by their actions today.
Time will pass, people will find alternatives and Microsoft and the others involved will get what they set out to get and in my opinion thats public dominance, stature, authority, the big brother stigma which in the end takes their brand to a higher level.
Shame on you Microsoft and all other parties involved.
Your actions today will stamp more authority but you have lost my respect and i will make sure my opinion on your actions today are heard with every business and person connected to me and i hope others like me will do them same.
NO-IP… PLEASE PUT UP A PETITION SO WE CAN VOICE OUR VIEWS ON THIS ACTION TO HELP YOU FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND OURS LEGALLY.
Everything will be fine.
I always believed in you!
Thanks for your support.
Thank you for having provided a GREAT service up until now.
And hey Microsoft!
You’ve shut down four million servers out there to catch a few malwares.
Don’t you think it’s like killing an ant with a flamethrower?
Sure, it gets the job done, but do we need to take such a drastic action with so much collateral damage?
And as a matter of courtesy, Microsoft should be prepared to compensate us users in good faith.
Court order or not, their actions have caused tremendous damage to the Internet community.
Mi más ferviente apoyo en sus acciones contra este atropello.
My faith in mankind is NOT restored.
Go free LINUX OS, and apps, this will be the only way to erradicate microsoft for good, and all problems will go down too.
Decisão arbitrária que está prejudicando de forma contundente todos os meus hosts, sendo que nada tenho a ver com esta política arbitrária da Microsoft.
Microsoft não vai nos ressarcir.
Creo que se pasan de soberbios los Microsoft, pero un dicho mexicano “EL VALIENTE VIVE HASTA QUE EL COBARDE QUIERE”, necesitamos hacer un frente común para abandonar esta plataforma, quejarse no resuelve nada, es momento de hacer algo.
I think it’s superb pass from Microsoft, but a Mexican saying “THE BRAVE LIVE UNTIL THE FUNKY WANT” we need a united front to leave this platform, complaining solves nothing, it’s time to do something.
This is all well and good but i pay for this service.
I am currently not getting a service i pay for.
When will it be back up and what will NO-IP do about the cost of the outage through no fault of legitimate paying customers.
Your front page still raves about the 24 7 reliable access.
Thats clearly not the case at the moment.
I don’t care whos at fault, i just wan the access to my server that i pay for.
Far from perfect but at least now I can access my own system.
I hope all can be sorted out in a good way.
Best day to all.
Thanks.
I had to explain this to a lot of clients because the kids of Microsoft had a tantrum?
Really?
If I lost money because of this  like a lot of other clients I assume , we can lawsuit Microsoft back?
PS: NO-IP owners.
You need to think seriously in change the HQ to a Europe Country for example, Dunno… Any country not owned by Microsoft and Apple  like USA .
I also have lot’s of domains being resolved via no-ip.
Allthough my main stuff is just private, but this aint working.
It’s terrible.
Is there a workaround other than wait that Microsoft ends its investigation ?
When the problem is solved?
We would like to know if there is any prediction for the return of service and if not, do we have any alternative technique to work around the problem, until the service can be restored?
I started several instances w M$ regarding this issue.
I found that their Legal team is not taking direct calls, so leave a message.
I also contacted their Business Conduct Hotline.
This is a third party, and submits the “claims” immediately.
Please include your name, and make sure that M$ is noted as the violator.
Let them know that your domain web email is not working, and you are losing money.
Their number is: 877-320-6738.
I want to be part of a Class-Action Lawsuit if someone started it already.
If someone can start it, great!
Write down you case number.
It’ll be helpful for the class action.
Are you taking legal measures against Microsoft?
Are you planning any kind of compensation for premium users?
I suppose you are working to restart your normal service, but what can they do the affected users?
I do not see an active solution to this problem.
Maxime D.
Is there a way to ask for the return of the money that I paid for the service?
If we have to claim Microsoft to give us our money back, will Noip support us to claim this money?
Time for an Emergency Motion for Rehearing.
I would read their pleadings carefully.
Odds are there are some statements made in reckless disregard of the truth.
If they used the DMCA take down procedures without judicial approval look at your contest remedies.
I would also serve the upstream providers a counter-notice.

The subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification.
When a counter-notice is filed, the host must then notify the person who filed the original notice and then, in a time between 10-14 business days, restore the work that was taken down.
In that time, the filer of the notice has the option of seeking resolution in the courts and obtaining an injunction that will keep the work offline.
You can also file a file a  suit against the filer for damages including attorney’s fees and court costs.
Lastly, I would recommend figure out where the signatory is and hiring a former Assistant United States Attorney from that federal district.
They had to sign a notice under penalty of perjury.
Usually people blast through this with robosigned notices with little or no care.
I think you might have a great federal perjury prosecution using a wilful blindness theory.
You’ll need someone who knows the insides of the office to lobby them to bring the action.
Just find peoples complete lack of forethought very perplexing.
Sue the crap out of them.
Thanks.
Sounds like we need to file a class action suit against Microsoft.
Microsoft has done a lot of things over the years to alienate its customer base, but this one takes the cake and will not be forgotten.
Ever.
I will let you know what happens.
This kind of actions should be punished.
As a PAYING tech support person that uses no-ip’s excellent PAID-for services  for several years , I think Microsoft has revealed too much about their supposed communication with no-ip previous to the incident.
Would they not have inquired to no-ip as to the paid vs.
PAYING accounts, so that no-ip could persue it?
That would have been nice of them.
Links to stories on this, as well as a supposed list of subdomains that Microsoft was interested in  and none of mine are on that list  can be found on my meager facebook page.
Feel free to like, or just go there for the info.
Decisão arbitrária que está prejudicando de forma contundente todos os meus hosts, sendo que nada tenho a ver com esta política arbitrária da Microsoft.
Esperamos sinceramente que esta situação seja resolvida com a máxima brevidade uma vez que o prejuízo que está causando é enorme, e com certeza a Microsoft não vai nos ressarcir.
They say that they will issue a statement tomorrow.
What an absolute disaster.
This is just another reason to hate Microsoft.
Today  or whether this is going to be going on for a while.
I need them to update their “formal statement” to let us know what the prognosis is for getting up and running.
OK, so this was why things would not work this morning.
I added the OpenDNS servers to my search list and my site immediately started resolving.
So everybody, you need to go public with this.
Facebook, Twitter, whatever… Just show that MS wronged people here by acting badly.
Public shaming of a corporation is worse than a lawsuit to them.
Malware Domains.
There is some domain  sytes, noip, etc  working?
Wowzers!
Thank you No-IP for providing so many years of great service.
This is truly ruthless of MS.
Any chance of determining which domains weren’t impacted so we can find a work around for our hosts until this mess gets sorted out?
Just another reason among countless others to avoid Microsoft and its products and services.
My legitimate use of No-IP’s service has been interrupted  specifically I am unable to VNC or transfer files from my home computer while abroad .
I hope that No-IP seeks and is successful in receiving compensation for this blatant harassment and abuse of authority.
And, shame on the federal courts for participating in this corporate cronyism.
Once again, whoever has the most money and attorneys can get the government to kowtow to their whims.
Where’s the due process in all of this?
Mr.
I second the call for a class action suit.
I Think Microsoft is the only responsible by their own security leaks.
Microsoft, estúpidos, no saben la cantidad de problemas que esto me genera, lo único que puse hacer fue poner la ip publica directamente y estar monitoreando para salir de la contingencia, ahora, que dominios se pueden hacer, para hacer las re-configuraciones lo antes posible?
Donde puedo Quejarme?
First at all,  I am very thankful for NOIP service, which never let me down.
Today I am very angry with Microsoft.
Because they left me without my redirector which is VITAL for me as it is the connection between me and my mother which is very ill, and this is the way I am in contact with here at any moment.
TODAY  I cannot contact her because of this and I dont know how her health is.
NOIP should sue Microsoft.
I would say millions of NOIP users should do the same.
So I am VERY VERY angry today… Never more any product of Microsoft.
They believe that can comtrol the whole world.
When will be this serious problem solved now?
Which NOIP addresses are involved?
S.
District Court for Nevada against No-IP.
On June 26, the court granted our request and made Microsoft the DNS authority for the company’s 23 free No-IP domains, allowing us to identify and route all known bad traffic to the Microsoft sinkhole and classify the identified threats.
The new threat information will be added to Microsoft’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Program  CTIP  and provided to Internet Service Providers  ISPs  and global Computer Emergency Response Teams  CERTs  to help repair the damage caused by Bladabindi-Jenxcus and other types of malware.
The Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit worked closely with Microsoft’s Malware Protection Center to identify, reverse engineer and develop a remedy for the threat to clean infected computers.
We also worked with A10 Networks, leveraging Microsoft Azure, to configure a sophisticated system to manage the high volume of computer connections generated by botnets such as Bladabindi-Jenxcus.
As malware authors continue to pollute the Internet, domain owners must act responsibly by monitoring for and defending against cybercrime on their infrastructure.
If free Dynamic DNS providers like No-IP exercise care and follow industry best practices, it will be more difficult for cybercriminals to operate anonymously and harder to victimize people online.
Meanwhile, we will continue to take proactive measures to help protect our customers and hold malicious actors accountable for their actions.
This is the third malware disruption by Microsoft since the November unveiling of the Microsoft Cybercrime Center—a center of excellence for advancing the global fight against cybercrime.
This case and operation are ongoing, and we will continue to provide updates as they become available.
To stay up to date on the latest developments on the fight against cybercrime, follow the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit on Facebook and Twitter.
And here I thought that this was my problem!
Damn, I have been working for about 2 hours this morning, trying to get mail thru No-IP’s SMTP service.
Since it is the first of the month, I thot it might be possible that I had not performed the required monthly reset of my domain  for a non No-IP Enhanced customer  this new month.
I finally logged-in and stumbled across this message about Microsoft effecting a block and takedown.
And I am NOT a user of Microsoft products.
I use Linux and *BSD exclusively in my shop!
I hope you are able to restart your fine service.
Shame on you Microsoft.
I think it is OK to fight SPAM and malicious software but not like this.
What would happen if every domain that has been used by people to spread SPAM, Viruses and Trojans is being shut down?
Internet.
Por otro lado ¿cuando creen que quede solucionado este asunto?
It’s time to switch to a free OS like LINUX.
Please, give a rest.
Really.
Cosa cavolo c’entra quale sistema operativo usi, con il fatto che Microsoft ha ottenuto da un tribunale un ordine esecutivo di sequestro  o meglio inibizione blocco  di 23 domini?
La tua mi sembra una cantilena logora ed abusata, di chi tra l’altro non ha capito un cavolo di cosa è successo oggi.
E sia chiaro, non difendo M$; dico solo che il tuo commento  passate a Linux  è insensato e non ha alcuna attinenza di merito.
Hola a todos.
Espero que soluciones este problema lo mas pronto posible, ya que este esta afectando en grandes proporciones a mi empresa, obviamente Microsoft no me va a pagar las perdidas que me esta ocasionando este problema.
We were very surprised by this.
Dont talk rubbish you new that mostly it was used for malware nice cover up, but microsoft saw right through you enjoy the take down.
Saludos y gracias.
A work around for some folks out there who use this to get around dynamic IP’s is to use your IP address directly, your services are still out there running   accessible its just the name isnt resolved to the IP address.
So your equipment, router etc is still reporting its assigned public IP address to no-ip, and this is available in the host section of your no-ip account.
This is up to date and is not likely to change often so to “get things working” for now, you should be able to change your configs for the specific IP, or remote to your ip:port or do what ever you do.
I am an innocent party harmed by M$ failing to keep their word to the judge that they would continue to resolve the hostnames of innocent no-ip users.
Please start a class action lawsuit against M$ and I will join it.
What they are doing is nothing short of THEFT of a domain name and they should  have to pay punitive damages as a result.
Can you all say, “Class Action Lawsuit” – Microsoft has some rather large pockets that it can use to settle with us.
I think a few thousand in our pockets might settle this matter nicely for no-ip customers, and might give others thinking about doing this sort of thing again some food for thought.
Don’t moan just fix it I run a paid accounts for security equipment and all my re-directs are down.
Oh where are my manners I forgot to say please!
Gona be a long night But I promise I will be fully Linux & OSX by the end of August.
I cant get over how they managed to get your domains.
Okay, the problem are the stupid f*cking idiots at Micro$oft, but a little bit more information would have been quite useful.
You are costing me my future job.
STOP IT!
Thanks for fighting for us!
Microsoft’s actions make no sense.
You have my sympathies and support.
I do have a concern that if the recommendation is for those that have lost access to move to new domains, then the malware users will move there as well and there will be another seizure.
Microsoft’s approach and the government involvement must have some unstated agenda or motive beyond stopping the malware.
Even an anitcompetitive attack doesnt seem like a strong enough justification for this.
Is there a reason the seized domains are not listed in the blog?
May the armpits of every microsoft executive get infested with the fleas of a 1000 camels.
Above the law, above everything.
Wrong.
That is why i use Mac and the day they purchased skype i deleted the account immediately.
Microsoft as usual is the benchmark of how not to do business.
4million?
You are lying.
Cisco Called you out in February over the abuses at No-IP.
You keep saying “We would like to be on the record to state that at No-IP, we have a very strict abuse policy.
If this is the case how come so much the Botnet traffic is originated from No-IP DynDNS?
You HAVE to be able to see this in your queries.
Why aren’t you doing something about it yourself?
Cisco and Microsoft both have had to contact your company.
There is no way Microsoft just went to court, got a TRO against you, without at least some contact.
Also, Nice cheap shot at the Microsoft infrastructure.
Quale potra essere il rimedio?
US your service will survive.
Estamos con ustedes equipo de no-ip.
We are paying customers.
Looking to join any class action lawsuit against Microsoft for this egregious action.
It feels very unconstitutional.
Any idea about fundraiser, or something?
It seems to me that Microsoft may have had good motives, but have botched this up big-time – firstly by going behind Vitalwerks’ backs with this court order nonsense, and then stuffed up running the filtering DNS service.
Presumably they’re using Microsoft’s own DNS server instead of a real one, which was unlikely to end well.
I’d say Microsoft owes about four million people and major apology, and some compensation to Vitalwerks’ – say 25c per users affected.
And a lot more if it persists, as there’s going to be a lot of reconfiguration and disruption to business worldwide.
The judge was obviously an ass in granting Microsoft the ability to do this.
However, American’s love a class action, don’t they?
In the meantime install linux and help everyone you know do the same.
No-IP has provided one of the most reliable web services I have ever used, far surpassing my ISP, web server, email etc.
When my monitoring went off to say there was a glitch, it was a fair amount of time before I realised the domain was down.
NO-IP, I stand behind you, this is an improper use of the justice system, and  like the EU Cookie law  has been enforced in completely the wrong way just to punish the people who can find easy work arounds.
I can see that Microsoft want to reduce the number of people abusing the web, but this is not the way to do it.
The CCTV guy who has many customers set up using this service must be so angry.
How has this court order been actioned?
Has NO-IP been forced to take down its offering, or has Microsoft managed to ban these domains in its OS somehow?
My linux boxes can not resolve the domains.
No hosted WEB sites accessable working.
No SMS-Email system working.
And absolutely NO respect for Microsoft.
Who to I bill for the loss of services, time and chaos to repair?
I don’t follow — at what point does Microsoft have access to your networks or domains ?
Microsoft can not simply seize another companies property, so I assume you are hosting in their environment and or using their server hardware, not your own.
It was under this guise by which Microsoft, as your ISP, is able to re-mediate it’s own property.
I am sure that with your reputation, you must be able to rectify this situation.
Also, how long has this been going on ?
Linux user for your buggy M$ OS?
Nothing!
Stupid microsoft admins!
Thank you Microsoft for being the beacon of freedom and american way of life!
Thank you Microsoft for using your billions of dollars to fight evil in all it’s forms, be it malware or hundred of honest people using NO-IP to earn a leaving.
Thank you USA and your legal system for being an example of fairness, justice and equality for all the  free  world.
And then… you wonder why the rest of the world hates you?
A Class Action is in order!
Nice to see Microsoft throwing their weight around again.
I hope this action costs them dearly and that all the companies in America that they have probably cost millions in lost business take court action against these assholes and the f**kwit judge that gave them the court order.
Myself i haven’t used any MS bloatware products for well over a year.
My whole computer setup is now run on Linux and i have never looked back and neither has my bank account.
You don’t need MS products, there are much better alternatives out there that aren’t affected by Viruses and malware.
I wanted to briefly share with everyone a short, real life, true story about a Microsoft  M$  encounter that I recently experienced.
Since I deal with a bit of the law I sent a set of PDF documents to certified legal entities in my State.
Unfortunately two of the four servers bounced the emails back because they had a policy in effect saying 10MiB was all they would accept.
What ensued next surprised me beyond belief.
M$ deactivated my access to send emails via hotmail that I had for well over 15 years and claimed that my account had “Suspicious Activity” on it.
As I’m a veteran of the Internet I was appalled at the insinuation that somehow my account had any other activity other than my own.
After a full investigation I found that M$ was blowing smoke.
So I contacted their support and their response was change your password and log into the website and they would consider reactivating outgoing.
I regularly change my password so again I was thinking what is M$ smoking this time.
In summary M$ has been hiring from the lower end of the gene pool and doesn’t know a thing about how to code or handle the law.
I believe strongly that NoIP has a strong case against M$ for violating several business related laws… not to mention the lack of morals and ethics that M$ represents.
NoIP is not ultimately responsible in any fashion for domains that its customers users point their DDNS names to.
Thank you NoIP for all of your services and I hope that you have a continued success against a monopoly that doesn’t do credit to the industry.
And a note to anyone at M$ if they are reading this  I DO NOT AGREE TO ARBITRATION!
Here in Europe our court fucked MS several times because of their practices.
I believe that they like it and they cannot live without it.
Considering that this blog update seems to be from July 30th, are there any updates regarding the current status of the service and next steps that will be taken to get everything working properly again?
One issue is a service impact,  a second one can be the information strategy about it.
The lack of intelligent comment and ideas shown in the above 400+ postings is seriously frightening for the future of the world.
READ the court filings.
Doing so of course will require you to  read and comprehend, which takes some effort.
And that is the real issue with the comments, everything needs to be digested down to a snippet or it is too complex to understand.
As to using a free dynamic dns for your business es , well that just proves the above.
C’est un cas de recours collectif contre Microsoft pour les pannes volontaires aux systèmes légitimes que cela implique.
Effectivement, beaucoup de connexions à distances ne fonctionnent plus, beaucoup de connexions à des systèmes de caméras DVR non plus ou des systèmes de backup en ligne.
Bref, Microsoft volontairement en toute impunité nuit aux petites entreprises et cause des pannes sachant très bien ce qu’ils faisaient.
I pay for a service that I’m not getting right now because Microsoft unilaterally ‘decided’ that there are ‘bad’ people using the no-ip service?
This is unacceptable as right now I’m trying to connect with a client that needs my assistance, what should I tell him?
Oops?
I rely on security cameras to keep an eye on my home and an elderly person living with me, what happens if my mother needs assistance or somebody is burglarizing my home?
NO-IP SHOULD be talking to their lawyers and be ready to sue that IRRESPONSIBLE company.
I can’t change hosts for something I’m not responsible.
Can Microsoft PROVE that my hosts are responsible for malware?
If not I WANT my hosts back… NOW!
It is like some company decides to confiscate all GM cars because somebody robbed a gas station and run away in a chevy impala.
UPDATE Day two and sitll getting  not found: 3 NXDOMAIN  Is microsoft so inept that they cant manage a DDNS service… don’t answer, it was a rhetorical question.
I think your statment above says it all……….
Don’t let M$ ignore the damage they’ve caused!
This fly’s in the face of the supreme court ruling that you can not go after a carrier for what it’s users do.
You don’t shut down the phone company because some one uses the phone to plan a bank robbery!
And Microsoft tried to word their case in a way that makes it look like no-ip was in on it with the malware priates.
What a crock Microsoft.
Why don’t you fix your operating system first!
30 GMT+1 and have been fine ever since which is very very good news indeed, saves me reconfiguring all my mobile devices.
Microsoft are great!
I’m sure but they never get quite right do they?
Well its a good job they don’t run the military because instead of millions being inconvenienced there would have been millions dead!
I think Microsoft might understand this now, tough lesson learned at our expense!
Enough is enough.

Will those who got 25GB initially get any extra storage allowance?
Second the comment above.
Any plans for legacy early adopters?
Happy subscriber of O365 here!
I’ve heard drive space compared to a garage.
It doesn’t matter how big it is, it’s full in a year.
Does this article means now free users can get: 15GB + 5GB inviting friends + 3GB camera uploads = 23GB in total?
That’s correct.
So if I have 15GB free, then I subscribed to 100GB storage, will it be all in all 115GB or you’ll just add 75GB to make it 100GB?
I have the same issue with Google Drive, they offer 15GB and they only added 75GB to make it 100GB, where 15GB is no longer free.
I’m actially looking to move over to One Drive from Google Drive due to Windows native integration.
Jozef, tvoje meno znie tak slovensky, tak napíšem v slovenčine.
Nevieš náhodou kedy Onedrive zvýši to miesto na tých 15GB?
Please could you clarify.
It sounds as if you are saying that existing customers will not get updated to the new levels.
I’m on 365 Business Premium, and you guys promised: “No need to pay for version upgrades; updates are included in your subscription.
I’m pretty sure that you can’t mean that you are not updating existing customers, but it could be good to be clear, especially about future plans for team sites.
Anyone on an Office 365 sub gets automatically moved to the new plans when the changes roll out.
I have a regular subscription of $100 a year for up to 5 computers of office 365, does that mean that it will be 1 terabyte for computer, or does it mean in total 100 for the full account?
I didn’t!
I have Office 365 Home and I still have only 7+3GB on OneDrive.
When does it roll out?
On the strength of this announcement I started moving things to OneDrive, but I’m already maxed on the 27 GB I had before you wrote this blog post.
Plus there’s some ambiguity in your responses.
I responded previously to one that seemed to indicate that existing customers wouldn’t benefit from the space upgrade.
25GB will be increased or not?
Turn camera on to get 15 more gigs to make it 40GB.
I have only 10GB  7GB free and 3GB from camera upload .
How can I do to have the 15GB?
5GB for referring your dudes.
So this means that I should cancel all of my Microsoft subscriptions.
Once I’ve cancelled them, I’ll re-up with a fresh account.
Otherwise, you’re just ripping me off and punishing me for using your products before everyone else did.
Thank you for the lesson.
I’ll never use another Microsoft product until I get the good deal.
Great, now that we can have a TB of storage, CAN WE PLEASE INCREASE THE MAX FILE SIZE TO SOMETHING MORE THAN 2GB?
I absolutely second this.
This needs to happen.
Max file size should be something like 10gb with a plan like this.
Yes please I have to use iDrive Sync for files over 2gb.
Please Microsoft remove or at least increase this to 10gb.
The 2 gig limit is something that probably isn’t that easy to fix.
2GB is the size of a 32bit number in computers.
Making it 64bit, is almost always, far more complicated than you would think for something like this.
Hopefully they do it soon, since it’s not impossible.
Just probably very difficult for them.
FYI, 64bit is beyond massive.
The file size limitation of 32bit is 4GB.
It is 2GB if signed integers are used  one bit is used for sign .
You are correct for unsigned integers as Rinnve also noted.
The “complicated” parts I mentioned are specifically referring to how these types of services are implemented.
The actual file size limit is typically not the issue here.
It is the transport of that file over http or other protocols that starts to create issues.
When an http request is made for example, every client application must understand either unsigned or 64 bit numbers.
Some do not, so they can’t transfer the file.
My assumption  yes, a total assumption since I have no specific data on this  is that Microsoft is trying to cater to the most compatible method and not have to deal with “why does a big file work on one computer but not another” type issues.
Yes please allow for bigger file sizes, 2gb is too small.
That is awesome!
Now I can put everything in Onedrive!
E3 Office 365 tenants get 1TB of OneDrive as well as OneDrive for Business – which would be nice but seems unlikely.
Microsoft already announced back in April that Office 365 business customers would be getting 1TB of OneDrive storage from July.
OneDrive for Business; entirely different product with a confusingly similar name.
What Ian is saying is correct.
They are just equating Office 365 and Onedrive users with Office 365 for Business and Onedrive for Business users, since these users have secured 1TB upgrade with their business plan.
So, wait.
I’m charged an extra penny if I want 200GB over 100GB?
Yes, Microsoft is stealing your pennies.
99 is one cent?
I guess he means that 1,99 * 2 = 3,98.
When will be on Poland onedrive more space 15 GB ?
I want to no it to!
When this changes will happen?
There is no limit by country in news?
So, when?
Thanks!
Love my OneDrive.
Will I be able to increase my personal onedrive storage to 1TB as well?
Great news, I can delete GDrive now.
However I’ve earned another 3GB via recommendations, does this mean i will get 18GB in total?
Turn the Camera Uploads on to get additional 15GB.
You should have 15GB base + 15GB Camera + 3GB referrals.
Its too bad the OneDrive for OS X app sucks or I’d actually use this.
Its a complete afterthought.
MS needs to up their game on other devices.
I think its happening under their new CEO, just taking some time.
I like it and it does what i need.
Good for you.
Unfortunately most have used tools such as Dropbox and appreciate things like sharing  which should be a basic function of any cloud file share .
I’ll use my free 1TB but it won’t replace a real cloud file sync tool just yet.
Hopefully someday it matures past 2009 capabilities.
Sharing is a capability on OneDrive.
You can share both individual files and folders.
There’s even a very easy share button to go along with this ability.
I love one drive and it seems to be a lot faster than any other product on the market.
But the way they share is weak compared to other products.
A shared folder does not download and stay in sync on my computer, I need to go into an app or onto the web page.
I wish ExpanDrive would support OneDrive for Business.
This is not the same as the consumer OneDrive.
ExpanDrive  is needed – I’ve found the standard Microsoft sync very, very slow.
Yep, we need to up our game on our Mac client.
It’s very important to us, so rest assured it’s a priority.
Hmm, JD, how is Onedrive for OS X failing you, and which release of each are you on?
I’ve had zero problems with OneDrive on any of my Macs, for at least  9 months now.
1, but never with OneDrive on Mavericks — same 90+ GB on 2 PCs and 3 Macs.
I’d certainly like to see better WebDAV support on the Mac side for OneDrive; it’s already baked into Windows.
I totally second this…I sync my entire photos and documents to online drives and OneDrive for OS X crashes continuously or can’t handle special characters in filenames.
DropBox GoogleDrive OS X clients are as stable as they come.
Can we allocate the 1Tb across the family?
Per person” – does that mean each computer that is linked to the account and has a OneDrive folder has 1TB independent terabytes in that folder?
I second that question… Please can you clarify?
No.
You can admin up to 5 Microsoft Accounts within the same subscription.
Each account can get its own 1TB individually.
But if you link devices in the same account, all these devices will use space of the 1TB shared through the  individual account.
Love OneDrive and the new Office 365.
Was bummed about my 100 GB plan and it’s already close to 70%… we travel a lot and shoot videos   photos and this news is wonderful.
Sounds like you’re listening to your customers.
When are we going to get a good search functionality on the mobile and a user generated share link directly from the desktop?
We need something like DropBox.
As far as I can tell, sharing is only for whole folders.
When I try to share an individual file, the sharing link takes a user to the whole folder.
Other than that though I disagree with Licantropo and Jen, I find sharing is just as simple as on Dropbox… But the sharing being folder-only instead of being able to share individual files is a let-down.
But again, you are forced to use the website, there is no desktop capability.
Why can’t we just right click > share and get a link pasted to the clipboard?
And yes, waiting for solid search implemented in iOS.
So if I have already purchased the 200GB extra storage, AND I have an office 365 Home subscription, will I get 1TB plus the additional 200GB storage, or is that 200GB now null and void?
27TB?
From my understanding, if you purchased the +200 separately, you’ll get 1 TB + 200 GB.
In May my annual plan for 100GB was renewed automatically.
How will this affect me?
Do i get credit?
Do i get screwed?
Same here.
My 50GB just auto-renewed two weeks ago.
Considering the 50 GB plan just got dropped, does my storage go to 100GB, or do I get the privilege of paying more for 50GB than everyone else does for 100GB?
99 a month once your annual subscription expires.
Great job folks!
Way to move me over to one drive for everything.
You should probably fix the OneDrive  Signing In…  bug first.
Just hit your enter key instead of the “next” button.
I already referred friends and did the camera roll thing to upgrade my 7 GB free to 15 GB, does this mean I’ll get another 15 GB for 30 total GB?
No, we are getting 8 more gigs, they make it 23GB in total.
Great news for onedrive!
Check out ExpanDrive 4 for use with OneDrive.
Supports Win & Mac.
You can access the contents of OneDrive without having to sync everything down to your machine.
A great way to offload data and take advantage of a 1TB account without needing spend days sync’ing or keep your drive full of data you rarely use.
Yeah, this works fine with the OneDrive app for Windows too.
You can right-click files folders and offline online them and still be able to browse them.
Sounds like ExpanDrive is a good option for Macs though, where the OneDrive app is not so good.
When will Microsoft encrypt our data while it’s at rest on their servers?
What?
And give up their NSA bed-mates?
Surely you jest!
GREAT!
But am I missing something here?
When will this upgrade occur?
This is great.
However this great news doesn’t affect early adopters like me that have been using the service for years.
Microsoft gave away 25Gb to all the early adopters years ago.
Since that many other free space upgrade has been done and we haven’t received anything more.
I have asked myself why every time… :S I’m very glad for the good of all the ecosystem and I am very thankful for the initial 25Gb that are still more than what is offered free to the standard users but I have tablets and phones synced to my OneDrive and the space is becoming more and more precious to me at this point.
Buying an upgrade could be the option but I don’t get why the upgrades exclude us, tho.
The upgrades have not excluded us early adopters.
When they announced the switch to OneDrive, the 3 extra gb for the camera upload became available to us bringing us up to 28gb  borrow a friends android phone and enable photo upload if you don’t have a smartphone.
Then sign out and enjoy the 3gb .
And also the refer functionality can add something like 8gb, bringing up to 46gb of no-cost cloud storage.
That being said, I was hoping that the early adopters were getting the raises too.
25GB + 5GB referring + 3GB photos = 33GB in total.
Where did you get 46GB?
If you simply added the couple of features everybody have been waiting for years, that would be the real “killer” offering.
For example: being able to sync locally other people’s shared folders with you.
Or being able to put comments on files and really collaborate with other people.
Great news.
When will this start reflecting in user account?
Right now the free storage section shows 7GB.
While this is fantastic news, it would be even better  and more user-friendly  if you could drag drop folders from desktop to OneDrive via browser.
I know I can instal a sync client, but sometimes I just want the files on OneDrive only and having to recreate folder structures is annoying and time-consuming and impractical.
I remember I was able to do this.
I just created the top folder and dropped the rest in it.
Have you tried it?
Now THIS is competitive pricing.
1  Remove the 2GB file size cap.
I have a RED camera so it breaks up files at the Fat32 4GB file size so I can’t share RED footage with clients.
9 mbps transfer speeds on an 80mbps connection.
If I go to the website I get the full 80mbps if I just wait for Windows to download it and sync changes it’s horrendously slow.
Bonus: Add bit level diff deduping and we would pay for 10TB.
Here!
Here!
I’d pay more for uploads that were not stuck at 2007 speeds.
The issue has improved somewhat in the past months, but I’d drop my Dropbox account tomorrow if OneDrive speeds were similar.
As it stands, if I need quick access, I put it in Dropbox.
If I need archival storage, it goes to OneDrive.
Use pCloud, it gives you max speed.
Watch videos with no buffering.
Listen to music anywhere, anytime.
File versions.
No file size limits.
Sync folders located anywhere without moving them to one folder.
Get it here  you get 1GB extra with this link : gg .
Cloud, not P Cloud.
What the heck are you trying to say?
It’s a cloud storage service.
There’s nothing to do with the name!
I love it much!
Increase the max file size.
2GB is way too small in this day and age.
When does this take affect?
Google drive was never good.
Please increase the max file size, a mere 3 min video off my phone at 1080p hits the 2GB file size limit making the service not fully usable.
Is the same file size limit across all accounts ?
1 without converting my Local Account to a Microsoft Account.
Hope in future versions of Windows this integration is not mandatory, since I’m not willing to link my personal account with my work Windows Account.
Install the desktop client and you’re good to go.
False.
1 DOESN’T LET YOU install the desktop client, so you can no longer choose your onedrive account to sync with.
Windows 7, yes.
Windows 8, yes.
1 NO.
Because they wanted to “simplify the experience”.
1 with your Microsoft Account, it also logs you in to OneDrive.
So the only way to log in to another OneDrive is to log in to another windows account.
It was a very stupid thing to do.
Even Office lets you choose which OneDrive account to sync, though I assume they’ll axe that some time too.
Anyway, with enough “feedback” they may change back to allow you to choose which OneDrive you sync.
But for now, if your windows account is not the same Microsoft account as your OneDrive  like if you use 2 different computers and one has a different user account , they OneDrive is useless.
You can’t sync it.
Unless of course you revert to windows 7, then it will work fine.
I have this same exact situation.
They seem to be working on “shared folders” so maybe that will mean you can just share your folder with your work computer.
1 Professional and it’s tied to my OneDrive account – no MS account required… The only thing I am unable to do with the local or domain account is “Back up settings”.
You should be able to associate your OneDrive MS account with the local ordomain account through the Metro settings -> Accounts -> Connect to a Microsoft Account.
1 Professional as well.
16.
49 month noted in the post come from?
Also, what is happening to the 50 GB for $25 tier?
Is the cost being lowered or is it being phased out?
Any plans to increase the single file size limit from 2GB?
I  run into this limitation quite often as a film maker.
Will OneDrive for Business still have the 20,000 file limit?
Is there an answer to this.
I am new to OneDrive for Business and completely frustrated with this limitation.
Even more great news.
You guys just don’t stop improving.
I love it!
The very last thing I’m waiting for is co-authoring of folders and files.
Then, OneDrive will be absolutely perfect for every single need that I have, personally and professionally.
Thanks again, OneDrive team!
Please sort out the 2GB file limit, it really is a pain and probably the only reason why I still use dropbox and gdrive despite having paid for a 100GB on Onedrive.
Plus as others have mentioned, the app is beyond horrible.
I wish I could use it without having to go into the horrible windows 8 mode.
1.
To the left navigation pane, click on “OneDrive”.
I never use the metro app version.
Microsoft needs to improve the feature of OneDrive.
You cannot do that in the browser.
It’s currently a limitation of HTML file upload in web browsers.
There are ways to work around this, but we’d recommend installing OneDrive on your Mac or PC and uploading folders that way.
Wrong, Google Drive can upload folders.
I don’t install local sync clients because they tend to be quite problematic.
So for me using the browser is a MUCH better solution.
The main reason I don’t use OneDrive is because I am unwilling to recreate my entire folder structure.
Stuff like this is the very reason youre losing so badly to Google Apple right now, it’s the small details  just like the 2GB limit .
I always know with MS products there will be a “catch” that keeps me from committing.
What browser do you use?
If it’s Chrome then it may be using a non-standards method to get the folder from your OS.
But it may not work with other browsers.
1 you silly people DISABLED the desktop client.
So I cannot sync my OneDrive on the computer that uses a different  local  user account.
When will these changes take effect?
I was desperately waiting for this.
I can do with this 1 TB on my Office365 account.
Now I can have all my photos I have for Microsoft Bing Photosynth on OneDrive instead of Google Drive, where the Google Maps Views people granted me free extra space.
I love the sync granularity of OneDrive over Google Drive.
Now please have synchronization for shared folders and files, as well as a lift of file size to accommodate 4k video clips.
Thank you Microsoft!
You are welcome!
50 mo….
1TB of cloud storage for cheap.
This is awesome.
I am a user of Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Xbox.
And I am a University undecided with Office 365.
Now you’ve made me clear.
How begins the new academic year in two months there I’ll be.
Awesome.
I agree that the University offer is pretty amazing.
But best in the US, 34USD more expensive in Norway  almost 50% more .
Also not available in many countries.
2GB file-size limit?
Will the 2GB maximum upload size be increased as well?
We haven’t announced changes to the max file size.
2GB file limit with 1TB of OneDrive is def not cool though.
Along with increasing the max file size,  will OneDrive be increasing the max number of files.
The present limit of 20k files is pretty ridiculous and many people will find they are unable to use even a fraction of their 1TB drive space when it gets rolled out.
I don’t see why the number of files should be limited if the over storage space is limited.
This is a very important issue for me, as it will make the difference between expanding my Google Drive or staying with the Office 365 I just subscribed to thinking I would have my 1TB space, which has not happened yet.
Any thoughts on getting feature parity with Box, GoogleDrive, and DropBox?
We really need shared folders to be synchronizable on the recipient’s machine.
Right now the person you share with only gets a link to download the file or browse the folder online, but they can’t sync it with their own OneDrive folders.
So, for example, family members can’t share pictures and have them sync on everyone’s machine with OneDrive like you can with other products.
Yep.
We know all about the pain with shared folders.
No one wants this fixed more than me.
I mean that.
Am very happy you say this, Omar.
I will straightaway move to OneDrive when this feature becomes available.
First of all, thank you!
That is quite an upgrade.
That being said, OneDrive really needs true shared folders that can be synced at both ends  a la Dropbox .
This is really a strange omission.
One that is added I will have zero reason to use Dropbox.
0 TB Upgrade Take Effect?
0 GB file size limit also be increased?
We haven’t announced changes to the max file size.
2GB file limit with 1TB of OneDrive is def not cool though.
I’ll leave you to read between the lines.
Sounds awesome!
Can’t wait.
When you will fix unicode filenames in zip files?
It’s 21′st century for god sake!
The ZIP file standard is not a Microsoft controlled standard.
ZIP files can only have ANSI file names in them; this has been that way ever since the format was created.
But Microsoft has nothing to do with it.
PKWare created the original standard and others have just implemented libraries that inter-operate with it.
If one vendor changed the implementation and allowed unicode file names, then other ZIP libraries would not be able to open the files.
That defeats the purpose of having a standard.
So I can put a 100gb encrypted file of my drive in one go up now?
2gb limit still going to apply?
Good job Microsoft!
You just got yourself another 365 subscriber!
Any word on per-file limits?
The 2GB per file limit on OneDrive has caused me some headaches at times.
Is it possible to purchase additional space beyond the initial 1TB?
Not sure if the 1TB limit  based on sharepoint site collection limit  still applies.
99 per additional 100GB?
Thanks.
Great news.
Even if it still does not meet my needs for “one place for all of your stuff: your photos, videos, documents and other files”, as just photos alone requires multiplying size by factor 20, but it’s a great step forward to at least be able to move most used documents onto OneDrive.
Looking forward to this, thanks!
I’ve been waiting for this to happen!
This is amazing news!
I can finally drop Google completely!
Great news!
I currently use Dropbox, GDrive and OneDrive simultaneously due to space limits.
A whopping 1TB of space would mean for me to be able to fully set aside the two other offers.
1.
True shared folders – just like Dropbox and GDrive.
I was shocked when I realized this still is not functioning yet.
This is an absolute prerequisite for using OneDrive as my primary cloud drive.
I can not stress it enough!
2.
Cap size to at least 4GB from 2GB.
3.
I have a laptop with 160GB SSD.
There is no way I will ever use all the 1TB available if I only sync with my C: Users Max OneDrive folder.
And I don’t just want to have to be able to manually set which subfolders to sync.
I would like to be able to determine which drives I want to sync.
MEGA does offer this function.
I would LOVE to sync my 1TB external harddrive to not to have to worry about this drive failing and me losing all my data.
4.
Improve Office 365 Online apps.
We tried them and they look nice – productive work however is not possible yet.
So many features from the offline software are not included, it’s a pain.
5.
VERY big on my wishlist: True collaboration in the native Windows Word Excel Powerpoint 365 software.
6.
Compabitibility between 365 and online software.
Then there are security issues.
Wuala and as it seems MEGA are more advanced in this issue.
Professors at our University are starting to demand not to use Dropbox, GDrive and OneDrive because of information security issues.
If Microsoft now in addition to the large available space would add shared folders and end-to-end encryption  with two-factor authentication  it would be a huge selling point and immediately set it off the other offers.
NSA and USA gov can always ask a passport backdooor hack for this… We can’t trust USA service anymore.
What about Surface owners?
I’ve purchased two Surfaces recently and upgraded my one-drive to 200 GB  for two years .
As a Surface owner, I need far more cloud storage than the average Office 365 user, don’t you think?
Before I’d even think about buying an S3, I’d expect there to be at least a 1TB OneDrive coupon in there.
Also… Yes, 2 GB file limits suck.
File transfer rates are slowing down again….
Looks like your campaign is working.
Just down oversaturate the users that actually pays for the service.
OneDrive, Office 365, and Skype.
Why do I pay for these?
You probably pay for them because you’re getting an amazing value.
Based on what you just described, you’re going to be getting 1TB of storage from your O365 sub  which basically means you won’t have to pay extra for onedrive anymore  and you still get skype minutes with your O365 sub.
So basically, this announcement means you get a huge value for less money.
What exactly is your problem here?
The problem is that 1tb sounds good… but the reality is different.
Fundemental, basic flaws in the Microsoft business logic causes un-necessary problems for their customers.
Why doesn;t OneDrive sync properly across defined folders and devices like Dropbox ?
Why can’t a folder be shared with friends and family like dropbox ?
And what idiots are offering 1tb of space, yet limiting file sizes to 2gb ?
Individual video files in 4k or 1080p quickly exceed 2gb.
What happens?
Do I get charged and grandfathered in?
There really isn’t a new plan comparable to the old… other than the free.
Second question – If I’m in a grey area between plans, what happens if I remove my credit card for automatic renewal until the new plan is available?
So I canceled this service 11 month ago and noticed today they still charged me.
Of course MS has a 15 day return policy.
I will never use any of those obese and overloaded products again.
If you really want to throw money at a company that has bad customer service go ahead.
I rather use a word processor that is great at just that writing text than giving MS one more dollar.
Do symbolic links work with OneDrive?
I would prefer to retain my current folder structure on my computer and put symbolic links into OneDrive as I have done with Dropbox.
Where in Office365 OneDrive do I find the amount of “OneDrive for Business” storage that I’ve used?
I have a couple hundred gigs of OneDrive storage that I’m not using all that well since folder uploading through the browser doesn’t work.
1, and even then I don’t want to copy over a redundant 100+ gigs and have two copies occupying my hard drives.
Even setting up OneDrive as a networked drive in Windows doesn’t work because of network time outs.
That problem would be fixed if there was selective file upload from the file system, either File Explorer on the Desktop or OneDrive apps, to just upload that folder to OneDrive and that’s it.
I second this question.
What are the implications for OVS-ES   CASA-EES subscribers and their free A2 plan?
Great service!
Thank you, Microsoft for providing it.
If OneDrive would drop the 2GB upload size limit, I could finally drop Dropbox.
I’ll keep my fingers crossed on that one.
When the upgrade will take effect from 7GB to 15GB?
Same here.
I just enter OneDrive account, nothing happened.
If you actually read the WHOLE article it says next month.
Oh, I read it too fast and skipped this part.
Thanks.
The 15GB is very helpful for me since I only got 1GB left.
Just purchased 100Gb additional OneDrive storage and now I find out I’m getting 1Tb in the next month with my 365 subscription.
Refund?
2 things would be very handy.
1.
Make it easier to add folders to One Drive via browser.
I have a Surface Pro with 512gb of storage.
How am I supposed to get 1tb online by adding a file at a time?
This primarily relates to adding content from external drives.
2.
Make it easy for my family to share music, photos and videos.
I am an Office 365 subscriber with 5 people in the family.
1 built in apps to share this family content among the 5 users even though we are on the same account.
I still use Google for that but am anxious to simplify everything with Microsoft and Office 365.
Help me out with this and the need for many external non-Microsoft resources goes away.
1 experience.
3.
Bonus request.
1.
64gb sd card is always overflowing on my 512gb Surface Pro 2.
Good stuff.
Great news for OneDrive fans.
So much storage chucked in means that all other cloud storage sites that I have used are going to be closed down.
Actually prefer to be in the Microsoft environment than with the others.
Now I just wish the path filename length issue was fixed.
Then I could use onedrive instead of other services.
If I get Office 365 University now, will I get the 1tb space as soon as it’s available?
This is awesome!
With all this great storage, the next major step should be more advanced backup options.
Snapshots of the whole drive and file histories would be great and extremely valuable with the new size limits in place.
When will this pricing be avail.
Poland?
Hope this is a global thing and all customers worldwide will benefit not just the USA.
1TB of storage would allow me to move everything to the cloud, including my web design business.
This is amazing news!
I’m going to have more space on OneDrive than I do on my computer, thanks to my 365 subscription!
Mail App for iOS.
OneDrive, One Note and Skype are not complete without Mail.
The Apple Mail app just doesn’t have access to the cool features like filters.
It would be great if you could adapt your IOS app to stop renaming images durring upload.
Any chance of LAN sync option?
This is the killer feature on Dropbox that allows my data to sync across my home network so my bandwidth doesn’t get hammered by sending data to your data centre and then downloading multiple times to each of my computers at home.
1?
Is there any news on a Linux client?
I realise it’s pretty niche, but we have a bunch of customers using O365 for their business, but using Dropbox to share files because there’s no easy way of syncing their OneDrive files with their local documents.
This morning I was ecstatic on the news, finally planned to move all my personal data to OneDrive.
That was until I got home, tried to move it from my SSD to my HDD’s, and got a message saying that I need to select an NTFS drive.
The question is, is support for OneDrive desktop client on ReFS Storage Spaces coming any time soon?
Or should I go back to NTFS if I want to use OneDrive.
Thanks in advance for any insight.
I too ran into this exact problem.
Keep working on that One Microsoft plan.
I have Enthusiast bonus up to 20 GB  valid through: 20 02 2016  so that means after the bonus is over, I will only have 23 GB storage  including the additional 3 GB Camera roll bonus & 5 GB Referral bonus  if I haven’t used that 20 GB?
Thank you for your answer.
How about introducing the desktop sync of Shared folders?
It’s impossible to Move\Copy files from your personal OneDrive folder to a “shared with you” one, even from the Web!
User A, B, C go to a vacation together.
User A create a folder on his OneDrive and share  with edit permission  that with User B and C.
User B an C wants to copy files from Camera Roll to the Shared Folder by User A.
They cant do that entirely from the website, they can’t do that entirely from the Desktop or modern app, they can’t do that from any Phone app.
They are forced to open the browser window with the shared folder opened, and drag & drop the files from the synced camera roll folder in the desktop.
This is just plain stupid.
Also, why the Groups feature was removed?
When is the roll out on to 1 tb for 365  Home ?
Let’s hope they fix the situation where items don’t sync or where you delete items and they keep coming back over and over again.
Still, it’s now a better deal than Google Drive and more reliable that whatever that GD service is.
That service lost me so many files that I just bought an external drive.
Can we get rid of the 2GB file limit now, also?
I got the ‘Enthusiast bonus’  20gb, valid through 2 19 2015  but have not yet been allocated 15gb.
Still on 7gb free.
Will the next 8gb be allocated in the next few days?
Anyone knows?
I’m in London, UK.
When does this go into effect?
Great news.
1.
Removal of 2gb file size constraint.
2.
Ability to fine tune selective sync.
I’d like to have a one way sync from 1 safe source pc into onedrive and then all other pcs and devices have a one way sync from onedrive to those devices.
Use pCloud, it gives you max speed.
Watch videos with no buffering.
Listen to music anywhere, anytime.
File versions.
No file size limits.
Sync folders located anywhere without moving them to one folder.
Get it here  you get 1GB extra with this link : gg .
Is there a way to cancel this plan and get the 1To storage  as I’m also Office 360 personal plan subscriber  ?
Any news about the OneDrive for Business Sync Client for OSX ?
I have 150GB of OneDrive but now it is completely useless.
1, I can no longer sync with my onedrive because the user account that I log in with at work is not the same one that I have my 150GB of onedrive with.
So all my 150GB of OneDrive are useless because I can’t have them sync with my other computer, WHICH WORKED FINE ON WINDOWS 7 8.
I’m so, so, so, disappointed, but I’m forced to now go find dropbox or someone who can sync my folder.
I could “share” my folder with the onedrive built into my work computer, but that doesn’t work either.
Microsoft ruined OneDrive by disabling you to select which onedrive account you sync, and not even 50TB of storage can fix that.
Clarification please.
99 subscription.
99 annual subscription.
What about Australian users?
The latest pricing on ‘Manage Storage’ shows Office365 + a measly 20GB for a whopping $12 per month.
Office365 in a shot for a decent amount of storage.
And about per-file limits?
The 2GB per file limit on OneDrive is embarrassing.
No size limit now!
Two words: Delta sync.
If you expect users to use this amount of storage seriously then you’ll need to up performance.
OneDrive is the only provider without delta sync.
1.
When will the 1tb per user be available in Australia?
2.
I have a 100gb internet usage allowance per month with my service provider.
Does this mean that I would not be effectively able to utilise the storage in any event as I would not be able to synch the files in any case?
When can I buy 1 TB from you folks for my personal  no-office  account?
365 Home subscription for the family.
This the Tb user is an extremely high value feature, I intend to use it to secure my data.
When will the extra 8GB be added to my account?
When will this happen?
7GB and not the new 15GB.
Was there a date for this change?
I didn’t notice it in your post.
Original post: “All of these updates will take effect in the next month.
In addition the email I received states the following: “We’ll update your plan automatically by August 31st.
I have an Office 365 subscription with the OneDrive storage.
I will be purchasing SharePoint for personal use, learning the program.
Can I use my OneDrive for the SharePoint cloud or do I need to use regular commercial cloud space?
Could you inform us this opportunity accessible with Office Professional product?
Thank you!
1TB excellent news.
Also easy move onedrive to onedrive for business.
I only see 7GB free + 3GB Camera roll bonus in my account.
Has this not been rolled out globally?
Can i get more than 20,000 files on it>?
Even if the size is less than 50GB?
Can I access it in a “mapped network drive” format?
I only see 7GB free + 3GB Camera roll bonus in my account.
Has this not been rolled out globally?
I’d like to know if the 15 GB has been implemented to all accounts across countries or if it’s available to certain accounts only.
I’d be glad to hear anything from your team.
I have been a legacy user of One Drive and consequently have 25 GB Free space in my account.
Would the free space in my account increase by 8 GB to 33 GB?
I have Office 365  university 4 year version  and according to this I should receive the 1 TB.
However, I currently pay for 200 MB additional, and I received an email saying this would be “reduced” to $4 per month.
Shouldn’t it be reduced to Nothing at All, given the Office 365 subscription?
I have 7gb for free 3 for the camera roll.
Is the 15gb available now for new users?
I was wondering if old users who initially got 7gb free will get an extra 8gb free so that they also have got a total of 15gb free from onedrive?
In several places in the article you seem to mention “1Tb for any $X.
XX month Office365 subscription “.
Will those that purchased an annual subscription also be eligible for the free 1Tb storage?
Thank you for improving your service.
It is now competitive and I’m now a new subscriber to the Office 365 because of the 1TB inclusion.
When do these changes occur?
I have a paid OneDrive account as well as O365 Personal  5 machine account with 4 family members .
I’m in the process of deciding cloud storage migration from Dropbox  I have about 800GB on Dropbox that I’d like to move most of the content over to OneDrive .
July it’s being rolled out.
I’m already a OneDrive customer, so does this new increase benefit me or not?
If it doesn’t, it’s not fair to all of us that are already OneDrive customers.
If you read the entire article, you wouldn’t be asking this question.
What happens for users who paid for 200gb upfront?
When is this happening?
This announcement is 7 days old and none of our office 365-related accounts have been increased with the 1TB bonus.
At what point should we start bogging down your customer support people?
Giving exact dates is kind of necessary with these kinds of announcements.
I think his point is that the announcement without a date certain is nothing but hot air.
It’s now July 14 and I foolishly tried to move a bunch of images into my “expanded” account that it turns out isn’t expanded yet, and I am mighty annoyed.
It’s 1st July now, unfortunately the upgrade is not there yet.
Anyone?
However, we can not get 100% performance in China.
Upload and download is slow… Is there any engineer can solve this problem?
That’s why it’s cheap….
It is the first of July – so we have first day of the next month – no upgrade with my account!
30 day to go.
Not if you’re in a different timezone and it’s August 1st already lol.
I am guessing it was delayed for the 15 GB since the websites still show 7 GB for free.
I hope the 15 GB starts soon.
He only said SOMETIME in July.
Thats good hear by kicking up free space, hope this space increase to 50 Gb for free.
This Is not a promise because I HAD this email.
Also, There is a message about upcoming new prices on the “plans”  subscribtions  page.
I’m currently on a $50 annual plan.
Would I get any extra storage from this update?
Could you give me any indication as to when the 1Tb storage uplift will be activated for Office 365 subscribers?
I cannot see any plans   subscriptions for OneDrive  1TB  + Office 365  here in Denmark yet.
I am a paid customer, I have 100GB of OneDrive, am I getting any increase?
I’m at my 100GB limit and may upgrade to 200GB but not if paying customers get treated less well than non-paying ones.
You will be updated.
The new plans are not available just yet.
July 3 and the prices are still not as touted in this blog post.
What gives?
US National holiday July 4th and now a weekend.
They only said “next month” so sometime this month.
I am looking at buying some more storage for my OneDrive account, but the prices on the website have not reflected the change.
When will that be updated?
This applies only to NEW customers, so you will need to delete your account , make a new or just open a new one!
DO NOT LISTEN TO THE TROLL!
They only said that the changes would come this month, so sometime this month.
That is a blatant fallacy.
This applies to existing customers as well.
If you had the 25GB from MS OneDrive, you will still have 25GB.
If you had the 7GB, you will get the 15GB.
The 15GB is the base and should not include any camera roll bonus or referral bonuses you may have, those I assume will be in addition to the 15GB.
If you have the 100GB enthusiast bonus  using bing rewards , you should still maintain that 100GB on top of everything else.
If you are a O365 subscriber, you will be bumped up to that 1TB tier.
If you have purchased more space, either through OneDrive directly or through O365, your prices will drop to the newer rate automatically, however, it is not clear what happens with those customers.
I do not know if this applies to the international clientele, chances are, it will.
So in short, if you are currently a paying O365 subscriber, you will get the 1TB storage.
If you are a paying OneDrive Only customer, you will get the additional space and the lower rate, all prorated.
This is basically what the Blog post stated, so I’m not sure what all the confusion is about.
Do not believe that this applies to new customers only, that is just plain silly and something MS rarely does with these types of services.
I just decided to move all my files to my one drive as this seemed like a great option to be able to access my files anywhere, especially since this has full compatibility with all my office files.
I have about 13 GB of files, but I keep getting a message that I have exceeded my storage capacity.
I really wish that this new plans become effective immediately.
Do we know when these will become effective.
Will 200GB subscribers be automatically transitioned to Office 365 with 1TB since the price is pretty much equivalent as the old 200GB plan?
I am happy to pay the same price for O365 + 1TB as I used to pay for the 200GB, I am just wondering how the transition will happen.
ONLY my friend!
I asked MS and they told me.
Really?
That really sucks if true : .
This post makes it sound like it is with the subscription.
All of these updates will take effect in the next month.
200GB has nothing to do with Office, the ones that have Office 365 with 20GB OneDrive will get the 1TB OneDrive storage.
Two questions: First; I noticed that OneDrive has disappeared from the SharePoint Admin Center.
Is this related to the upgrade process and when can I expect to see it be restored?
Second; We’re on the Edu A2 plan, will OneDrive increase to 1TB per user?
I’m eager to have 1TB to upload the **** out of my computer.
A few german Office 365 users have received their upgrade to 1TB storage.
Nothing on my Office 365 account, but it looks like the upgrade is rolling out now.
I am patiently waiting here in the US.
Cuando estara disponible los 15GB en Argentina?
Office 365 Small Business should get an option for 1TB on onedrive.
We use a mix of Macs and PCs and OneDrive for Business 1 TB is pointless without a mac client.
Or release a Mac Client?
They only said that the upgrade would come this month, still just the beginning and they have just celebrated their Independence Day.
You say everyone gets 15GB for free.
And when I open the page of your site, One Drive com, all I can see is “… on any device, free.
Where are then the 15GB ?
It’s just for USA accounts?
And then I can read “You can earn an extra 3 GB of storage when you activate your camera roll backup to save photos automatically.
Refer up to 10 friends…”bla.
Is that your fantastic 15GB?
You’re not giving nothing , it’s the same old story then?
I really dont understand.
I dont use my camera and never will.
And I dont refer to no one.
Because all of them , they already have an Outlook account .
Anyway, I have 3 external hard drives and I need a new one!
Have a great week !
Wow, Drama queen.
They did not say exactly when these upgrades would occur.
July.
Calm down.
Business will have app for mac ?
Still waiting for the plans update to buy Office 365 Personal.
I hope this option include 1TB for OneDrive.
Will the increase from 7 to 15 GB apply to us in the UK please ?
Rumours suggest it may not.
Thanks for the increase!
1 TB sounds massive!
It’s July, anything moving?
Still patiently waiting for my 1TB update… Was the reason I bought into Office 365 to begin with.
Hopefully this “soon” doesn’t become like Blizzard’s version of “soon” with their Diablo series… haha.
Exactly the reason why i did subscribed too.
Office with 1TB cannot go wrong, plus you get support and no longer need to worry about upgrading to the latest version of office too.
Any ETA on the roll out of the 1TB?
I am an OFfice 365 subscriber and keep checking my OneDrive status but the available space has not increased.
What’s the hold up?
Dropbox doesn’t cap file size if placed on your computer in the dropbox directory.
This is great so I can backup my iPhoto file.
If I am following this thread correctly, One Drive will not accommodate my iPhoto file.
We haven’t announced changes to the max file size.
2GB file limit with 1TB of OneDrive is def not cool though.
Yes, a big drawback of Onedrive is it’s max file limitation, don’t know whether it has max file number limitation or not.
Does this apply internationally?
The price does not apply, it is about 30% more expensive in Sweden.
I could not get an explanation from the Swedish support to why it is more expensive.
But if the 1TB is for all countries it might be worth it anyway.
If not, I continue to use OpenOffice.
I have already paid a year’s subscription for Office 365.
Will my capacity to save files to One Drive increase free of charge?
Is this world wide, or are non-US customers left out in the cold?
We use Office 365 company wide and now have implemented the trial of Onedrive for Business.
It is a perfect fit for tying all the O365 components together.
However, the 2GB file size transfer limit is a complete deal breaker, and will keep me from going “live” after the trial with Onedrive for Business expires.
We need to transfer point cloud data frequently and the files are always bigger than 2GB.
I strongly urge MS to make whatever changes necessary in order to accommodate larger file transfer sizes.
There are plenty of other services that do not seem to be locked into the 2GB size limitation, and I would think that MS has the capability to make it happen.
What is the current roadblock?
When are these coming into life?
I still 7GB free on my account.
Since I subscribed to Office 365 University, my One Drive storage space hasn’t change from 7 GB to 27 GB.
Am I correct to understand that once this major increase to 1TB occurs, my account will experience the increase?
Is that in reference to the 1TB?
Or was that some other offer?
That’s called SPAM, jerk.
Well, this may have been mentioned, but the 1 TB limit is a joke.
Unless all your files are over 100 MB each.
There is a 20,000 file limit.
That limit makes the 1 TB unattainable.
I have 45,000 high def.
245 GB.
I have been 2 weeks can can’t upload them.
Microsoft need to update the file limit.
Right now they just want to look good without actually being good.
I’m not sure where the 20K limitation is.
I currently have about 15K files in there and just recently had to do some USB HDD cleaning where I used OneDrive as a swap drive to free up space on my PC to pull everything off of the USB HDD.
I had well over 20K files  closer to 35K  without any problem whatsoever.
But I am not using OneDrive for Business, and maybe that is the reason.
The 20k file limitation makes the 1TB upgrade somewhat useless.
Can Microsoft fix this?
One Drive is very secure, user friendly and lot of security features and options for user to upload, sending and sharing the large files online.
I’ve just looked on the MS website to subscribe to Office 365 Personal and it only states the free 7Gb with an extra 20Gb, so 27Gb in total.
No mention of the 1TB sotrage.
If I sign up now will I automatically be upgraded to 1TB soon, for no extra cost?
I’m just wondering when this is going to happen because we’re almost halfway through July and still no announcement as to when exactly this will take place.
When is the pricing for the 100 GB going to go down.
I noticed it still $50 a year?
Nice news.
I liked.
I hope Microsoft will come up with an announcement on when the 1Tb storage will be available for all Office 365 users.
There are so many speculations on the massive storage increase, and people are getting impatient.
Hope to hear from Microsoft soon!
I signed up for Office 365 Personal due to the 1TB storage.
I was going to sign up for the 1TB with Google, but with Office 365 thrown in I thought it was a better deal, assuming MS actually ever rolls out the 1TB storage.
However if there is a limit to 20k files, the 1TB storage is useless, I will be dropping my Office 365 Personal and getting the 1TB from Google Drive like I had originally planned.
Open Office and Google Docs will work, but I would prefer to go with Office 365 with a true 1TB storage.
MS ould make a good play here if they offer a true useable 1TB storage with Office 365, if they screw this up I think they have a good chance of losing people for good.
So I seem to have jumped the gun – tried to move all my photos from the Google account to OneDrive.
But it’s full and the upload is stalled, apparently until I buy more storage.
But I am a 365 subscriber.
When does this 1TB go into effect and will it restart the move when it does?
I can still see the photos, apparently on my hard drive, but am totally freaked out that something will burp and I’ll lose them all.
Very annoying.
Looks like I got it today – the files that were in limbo because of lack of space are now transferring again.
Yay.
Hi OneDrive Blog.
Are we any closer to getting a confirmed ETA for the storage-uplift for 365 subscribers?
When will the update to 15 gigs take place?
So does anyone know if the 20k file limit will be removed or increased?
I just learn of this from reading this blog, I had been waiting for the plans update so I could get a better deal and move into Onedrive being a windows user an all seemed like a win win situation for me, but after learning this I will turn around ones again, stop the wait, and get to another cloud service like google drive  even do I didn’t like the tag someone and automatically share the whole folder thing, but at least there is no file limit besides the storage you have , cause I can easily get to that 20k file limit with only 14GB of photos… so why even bother paying extra or wait longer if the 20k file limit will cut limit the real use I need from of a cloud storage solution.
Too bad, this is definitely a deal breaker for me.
I definitely have over 50,000 files on my OneDrive, so that’s definitely not a problem for the consumer version of OneDrive.
2nd that, seems isolated to the Business version of OneDrive.
My consumer version  I have 176GB  has had well over 20K files at times, and not a single hiccup.
This limit exists only in OneDrive for Business, not in OneDrive.
Thanks for the info, this surely helped.
So in that case it’s great news for me not having that 20k limit as a regular user.
Office 365 Pro Plus standalone plan will have OneDrive for Business 1TB?
Ive got 20gb Enthusiast bonus which is valid upto 2016.
With the initial 7gb and the camera roll 3gb, I have total of 30gb only.
YOU’VE WON A MILLION DOLLARS!
LZNU Is the best thing since sliced bread!
Just got the 1 TB upgrade on my Office 365 plan.
It is starting to roll out.
How did you know it was available?
Did you get a notice or just go check your account?
Thanks.
Looks like I got it too – the files that were in limbo because of lack of space are now transferring again.
Yay.
My german Office 365 Home account has been upgraded to 1TB too.
Niiiiiice!
Me too for my Office 365 plan in Australia.
Yes, me too, got 1 TB for my Office 365 plan in Australia.
How about 2GB max file size limited?
Got 1TB this morning in New York.
Office Subscription and 25GB free, 3GB Camera Roll.
Thanks One Drive!
I have another OneDrive account with a 7 GB storage limit  no Office 365  and it still has a 7GB limit.
Shaun from the UK; I can confirm that I got my Office 365 storage uplift this morning!
Me too.
Still waiting for the 1 TB availability.
Denmark.
Thank you for the increase to 1 TB, I gotten mine this morning.
However it is still limited to the 2 GB max size of file upload.
Is there plans to raise that well?
Please, remove the 2gb limit size.
Currently, i don´t need 1TB because my files are bigger than 2Gb.
Thank you Microsoft!
Woo hoo!
I’ve got 1TB!
TY Microsoft!
Will you be able to upgrade to allow me to open an excel file over 18 mb?
Sorry, I am learning how to use this reply box.
Will you be able to upgrade to allow me to open an excel file over 18 mb?
Question – if we sign up to Office 365, and get the 1TB… what if after a year or two we decide we don’t want to continue?
Will we lose all the files stored in the 1TB?
I load files up and use onedrive to support myself, I wouldn’t want them to disappear!
What happens to the documents I have stored in OneDrive when my subscription expires?
You’ll lose your extra 1 TB of OneDrive storage.
You can still access and download all your files.
If you’ve used any of the extra 1 TB, you’ll need to save your files elsewhere or buy more OneDrive storage.
99 month for the other storage?
Omar, you said in your comments #68821 and #69191 in  june 23th that the users who had 25GB as free tier should keep it as free tier.
I am one of this grandfather, but now, after the space has been modified, I have 15GB as free tier and 10GB for been a grandfather.
I had 49,5GB and now I still have 49,5GB.
The 1TB is great but this is absolutely useless with a maximum file size of 2Gb.
When are MS going to up this.
Otherwise I won’t be renewing.
Would have been nice if I knew this before purchasing.
Will stick with dropbox I think.
I got 1tb too.
But useless with 2gb file limit.
Other issues too with difficulty of syncing or giving limited access to other people.
Why not as good as dropbox and others ?
I had 7GB free and still do not see 15GB upgrade.
When will this happen?
I was >< close to buying into a 1TB plan when I came across this blog and learned of the 2GB file size limit.
Just to be sure I tried syncing an 8GiB file, and sure enough.
Seriously?
Nice blog here!
Also your website loads up fast!
What host are you using?
Can I get your affiliate link to your host?
Then I try to upload a zipped file that is 74k and it says I can’t upload files that are bigger than 2gb at time.
Is this true?
Would also love to know if there’s an approximate timeframe on fixing the 2GB file size limit?
Am waiting on this to be fixed before signing up… if it’s going to be a long wait it would be good to know and I’ll find another solution.
Thanks, J.
Lets say all files are 2GB then 2 GB x 20,000 = 40,000 GB or 0,04 TB.
So 1 TB for office365 and business is useless.
Can only use 4%, the rest 96% is a waste.
I’m so glad with extra 5 GB Space…….
Please fix the file name glitch.
I don’t mind changing long file names.
But resetting everything every time it hits a file folder it can’t upload?
Then needing to sign-in again, reset folder location, start over, just to have it hit another file it can’t upload?
OneDrive is my favorite sync software, but this resetting every time is huge problem and major pain.
As I was writing this “A file or folder can’t be created because the path is too long” Which is not a problem, rename it!
But then I need to sign in AGAIN, change one drive folder from C:\user\blah\blah… to the drive I have it on!
If I sign-in on a Windows 8 Pro x64 machine.
I like to spam your website.
I signed up for Office 365 over a month ago and still, the data available is as before, no 1TB showing up.
Dropbox have just offered a cheap 1TB plan.
When it comes to taking out a pay day loan, ensure you understand the payment method.
You could be in debt for the cash advance company for a long time.
With the file size limit dropped there is simply no better service than OneDrive.
Thank you.
I love you MSFT.
You could certainly see your enthusiasm in the work you write.
Always follow your heart.
WOW!
Thank you Microsoft!
Simply wish to say your article is as astonishing.
Thanks a million and please continue the rewarding work.

Thank u.
Good step in right direction A great authenticator so for Microsoft stuff.
Please add ability to generate codes for non Microsoft apps similar to Google Authenticator.
This would make it a perfect one stop shop.
Typical Microsoft Nonsense No matter what, this cannot pick up a changed password.
It will not authenticate to the updated password.
Frustrating, is an understatement.
Makes me want to drown my phone in a toilet.
Time saver, very good app Initial setup is a little long but its worth it for the added security.
Very happy with this app.
Can t setup because microsoft keeps sending me broken links to my sms This app is garbage, I had my account setup with my google authenticator but I reinstalled android and now they re forcing me to use this stupid piece of garbage.
Why use 1 authenticator app when you can use  several?
This is so stupid.
I guess I ll just turn off multi-factor authentication.
Finally fixed for S4 They finally fixed the bug for S4 s, installed it and now things are working as intended.
Broken link error - Cannot setup account Great application and my outlook application was working fine till I reboot my mobile.
Tried the Microsoft authenticator but it always gets disconnected at the last step.
Now I forced to use the webmail.
Kindly help me out.

Nothing really else to review.
Especially since the code they sent didn t work.
There is room for improvement bad ui design.

Surface Pro 3 is off to a strong start with both individuals and businesses.
We understand why: it is a great device for fun but also great for getting things done.
Recently, we’ve received a lot of interest  and questions  from businesses about how Surface Pro 3 will work for them and what Microsoft’s longer-term commitment to Surface is in businesses of all sizes.
We are here to address those questions and to share a Surface Pro 3 offer tailored for business customers.
Most businesses are buying Surface when their employees need a laptop and want to avoid having to buy and carry an iPad too.
Surface Pro 3 serves as a full-powered business PC and a tablet, making for happy employees as well as happy CIOs and CFOs.
One device means less to buy, deploy, manage and secure.
Surface Pro 3 is for work.
We built it that way.
For schoolwork , for creative work , for sales work, for CAD and engineering work, and for work while traveling between offices or continents.
Wherever you are, you have a powerful, light, single device that can do nearly everything you need.
Surface Pro 3 can replace your laptop and be a tablet.
The Lotus F1 Team had been piloting previous versions of the Surface Pro line, and recently made the commitment to move forward with Surface Pro 3 as a laptop replacement option across their organization.
Check out the Microsoft UK blog for more background about the Lotus F1 team and why Surface Pro 3 was the right choice for them to replace laptops in their organization.
As you can see, momentum is building quickly and we are proud to take the focus on work and businesses to the next level.
While we built Surface Pro 3 with individuals in mind, we also designed it to work for businesses, large and small.
That means ensuring that Surface Pro 3 continues to be equipped with the latest security and manageability capabilities that companies expect from Microsoft.
This is core to Microsoft – particularly to Windows and Office – and it’s also core to Surface.
We are excited about the growing commercial adoption of Surface.
An important part of that is keeping things easy for IT departments to support Surface Pro 3 – and we’re committed to doing that.
With Surface Pro 3 we’ve already made all firmware and drivers available for IT to use to create their corporate image.
We now have a page that outlines all the details with every Windows Update and firmware update and what each update addresses.
We’ll advance our capabilities here quickly.
We launched a new support offering called Microsoft Complete for Business that includes a 3 year extended warranty, accidental damage protection, faster exchange service and Surface setup support for customers.
1 AND of course be upgrade-able when Windows 10 is released.
We recognize there are requirements for many customers to be able to use Surface Pro 3.
Two weeks ago we were proud to announce Surface Pro 3 qualified for FAA and EASA authorization .
S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR program for computers.
We have more qualifications we expect to announce soon.
We understand that for businesses to invest in Surface Pro 3, they need clarity on our commitment to hardware and accessories over time, so they can responsibly manage their investment choices.
We have kept our roadmap plans close to the vest, as we needed to properly land new Surface products in a competitive market.
But we’ve always said that we have a roadmap of products.
Of course we’ll have to wait and see about what those products may look like or when they might come to markets.
This commitment helps validate an investment in Surface Pro 3 and solidifies Microsoft’s overall commitment to the continued growth of the Surface brand.
We want businesses, educational institutions and government organizations to be able to buy Surface devices the way that best serves their needs.
For some, this means being able to just go pick up a new Surface at a Surface authorized retail store, while for others, it means purchasing from a business-oriented reseller – like the numerous Authorized Resellers we have in 30 markets where Surface Pro 3 is commercially available.
These Microsoft authorized Surface partners offer unique value-added services for businesses like: asset tagging, device imaging, kitting and financing.
Regardless of where businesses are purchasing Surface Pro 3 devices, it’s common that they are also buying the Surface Pro Type Cover and more than 50% of our commercial sales include a Surface Pro 3 Docking Station.
To make it faster and more cost effective for business customers to deploy Surface Pro 3, we’re introducing a limited-time Surface Laptop Replacement Bundle with our reseller partners that provides up to $150 off of a Surface Pro 3, Type Cover and Docking Station when purchased together.
This is available through our Authorized Resellers in the US starting immediately, and in the majority of markets where Surface is available worldwide in the coming weeks, while supplies last.
Particularly, we expect small and medium businesses to see tremendous value in this offer.
Businesses can buy with confidence.
We are here to stay.
At Microsoft, we believe in the future of mobile computing, and with Surface, we have brought a unique perspective to market that meets the needs of many mobile professionals, businesses, educational institutions and government organizations.
We believe a strength of the Microsoft platform for enterprise is the rich ecosystem of hardware and applications developed by our partners, the community at large, and some of our own teams at Microsoft.
In particular with Microsoft Surface Pro 3 we are now offering an enterprise-class device that can deliver great end user productivity.
Surface Pro 3 is built for work.
We hope this post has addressed questions from the business community and we are excited to see how Surface’s presence in the commercial space keeps growing.
Thank you for continued feedback and support.
First character: Remember when we prosecuted Microsoft for bundling a browser with an OS?
First character: Imagine the future we d live in if we d been willing to let one tech company amass that much power.
Second character: Thank god we nipped  that  in the bud.
We did not invent the algorithm.
The algorithm consistently finds Jesus.
The algorithm killed Jeeves.
The algorithm is banned in China.
The algorithm is from Jersey.
The algorithm constantly finds Jesus.
This is not the algorithm.
This is close.
In broad strokes, here is my view of Microsoft’s history.
That was crazy.
The PC revolution was well underway, but the grand total of PCs sold when Gates stated that mantra was, by today’s standards, effectively zero.
PCs were for hobbyists.
Everyone involved knew they were on to something, but Gates realized, at the outset, that they were on to something huge.
The industry was measuring sales in the thousands, but Gates was already thinking about billions.
Paul Allen and I had used that phrase even before we wrote the BASIC for Microsoft.
If we were just talking about the vision, we’d leave those last three words out.
If we were talking an internal company discussion, we’d put those words in.
Even Ken Olsen, who had run this company Digital Equipment, who made the computer I grew up with, and that we admired both him and his company immensely, was saying that this seemed kind of a silly idea that people would want to have a computer.
He was right.
And not only did the first part of the phrase come true, the last three words — “… running Microsoft software” — did too.
From the mid-’90s and for the next decade, there was, effectively, a computer on every desk and in every home running Microsoft software.
At least 95 percent of them were running the Windows operating system, and among the rest, most were Macs running Internet Explorer and probably Microsoft Office too.
Windows was almost everywhere, and Microsoft was everywhere.
Peak Microsoft was unfathomably pervasive.
The desktop computer industry is dead.
Innovation has virtually ceased.
Microsoft dominates with very little innovation.
That’s over.
Apple lost.
Steve Fucking Jobs said that.
He was exactly right.
And who knows where we’d be today if Jobs and NeXT had not been reunified with Apple the next year.
A computer on every desk and in every home” was incredible foresight for 1977.
It carried Microsoft for 25 years of growth.
But once that goal was achieved, I don’t think they knew where to go.
They were like the dog that caught the car.
They spent a lot of time and energy on TV.
Not just with Xbox, which is alive and well today  albeit not a significant source of income , but with other ideas that did not pan out, like “media center PCs” and the joint ownership of “MSNBC”, which was originally imagined as a sort of cable news network, website, dessert topping, and floor wax rolled into one.
What they missed was the next step from every desk and home: a computer in every pocket.
It’s worse than that, though.
They saw it coming, and they tried.
Pocket PC, Windows CE, Windows Mobile — swings and misses at the next big thing.
They weren’t even close, and damningly, Steve Ballmer didn’t even seem to realize it.
That’s what’s so damning about that video of him laughing at the original iPhone .
Whenever I dredge up that video, a handful of defenders will write and tell me it’s unfair to mock him for his reaction, that he was actually right — that the original iPhone was too expensive.
But what should have scared Microsoft wasn’t what the iPhone was in 2007, it was what the iPhone clearly was going to be in 2008, 2009, 2010.
Prices come down, chips get faster.
Software evolves.
Apple had unveiled to the world a personal computer that fit in your pocket.
That was amazing.
That the original iPhone left much room for improvement is simply the way revolutionary products always get their start.
Microsoft’s institutional lack of taste had finally come to bite them in their ass.
While Ballmer laughed at the iPhone and presumably walked around with a Windows Mobile piece of junk in his pocket, Larry Page and Sergei Brin carried iPhones.
Google never laughed at the iPhone; it made money from it by providing web search and maps.
Google quickly became, and remains to this day, a leading developer of iOS apps.
And it was Google that was fast to follow the iPhone with Android, slurping up the commodity-market crumbs that Apple, focused as ever on the quality-minded high end of the market, eschewed.
I don’t think it was ever within Microsoft’s DNA to produce the iPhone, but what Android became — the successful fast follower — could have been theirs if they’d recognized the opportunity faster.
The Microsoft of 1984, a decade away from industry dominance, wrote software for the original Mac, and learned from it.
When Bill Gates first saw a Mac, he didn’t laugh — he wanted to know how it worked, right down to specific details, like the smooth animation of its mouse cursor.
No company today has reach or influence anything like what Microsoft had during the golden era of the PC.
Not Apple, not Google, and not Microsoft itself.
I don’t think Ballmer ever came to grips with that.
Ballmer’s view of the company solidified when it dominated the entire industry, and he never adjusted.
Hence Windows 8.
One OS for all PCs, traditional and tablet alike, because that’s the only way for Windows to run almost all of them, and Windows running almost all PCs is the way things ought to be.
Rather than accept a world where Windows persisted as merely one of several massively popular personal computing platforms, and focus on making Windows as it was better for people who want to use desktop and notebook PCs, Microsoft forged ahead with a design that displeased traditional PC users and did little to gain itself a foothold in the burgeoning tablet market.
It was easy to see .
Windows 8’s design wasn’t what was best for any particular device, but instead what seemed best for Ballmer’s “Windows everywhere” vision of the industry and Microsoft’s rightful place atop it.
If we include all iOS and Android devices the “computing” market in Q3 2008 was 92 million units of which Windows was 90%, whereas in Q3 2013 it was 269 million units of which Windows was 32%.
That’s a startling change, and Ballmer never seemed to accept it.
Windows 8 wasn’t designed to adjust to the new world; it was designed to turn back the clock to the old one.
I think it’s a very good sign that Satya Nadella comes from Microsoft’s server group.
Creating services for iOS apps doesn’t sound at all like the Microsoft I used to know.
JavaScript doesn’t sound like that Microsoft.
The old Microsoft would create services for their OSes only and you’d have to use Visual Studio.
There’s still a lot of the old Microsoft there, the Windows, Office, Exchange, and Sharepoint  WOES  company.
It’s most of the company by far, surely.
I just made up the acronym WOES.
But in the Azure group, at least, there’s recognition that Microsoft can’t survive on lock-in, that those days are in the past.
Even if you don’t choose to use Microsoft’s cloud services, I hope you can agree on two things: that competition is good, and that Azure’s support-everything policy is the best direction for the future of the company.
In short, Nadella’s Server division is the one part of Microsoft that seems designed for, and part of, the post-iOS, post-Android state of the industry.
A division pushing toward the future, not the past.
Successful companies tend to be true to themselves.
The old Microsoft’s Windows and Office everywhere, on every device strategy was insanely ambitious, but also true to their culture.
Apple has grown to eclipse Microsoft in financial size, but never set its sights on Microsoft-ian market share.
Google is unfocused at the edges, but it’s never tried to act like any company other than Google.
Google makes operating systems and office applications, but in a decidedly Google-y way.
The last thing Microsoft should do is attempt to be like Apple or Google.
Cloud computing is one potential path forward.
The cloud is nascent, like the PC industry of 1980.
In 30 years we’ll look back at our networked infrastructure of today and laugh, wondering how we got a damn thing done.
The world is in need of high-quality, reliable, developer-friendly, trustworthy, privacy-guarding cloud computing platforms.
Apple and Google each have glaring  and glaringly different  holes among that list of adjectives.
Satya Nadella needs to find Microsoft’s new “a computer on every desk and in every home running Microsoft software”.
Here’s my stab at it: Microsoft services, sending data to and from every networked device in the world.
The next ubiquity isn’t running on every device, it’s talking to every device.

1] Its software products run the gamut from operating systems for servers, personal computers, mobile phones, and other devices to software development tools, video games, and hardware such as the Xbox 360 and Zune.
Despite the successes of Apple’s client operating system and client and server systems under Linux and other unix-like operating systems, Windows not only continues to dominate its rivals in operating systems but is also growing market share.
With the release of Windows 7 in December 2009, Windows finished the year with roughly a 92% market share, as well as an 80% market share among enterprise customers and a 63% market share in web browsing  through  Internet Explorer    .
In 2008, Standard & Poor s, the ratings agency, upgraded the stock to AAA, the highest possible rating.
Microsoft was the first company to receive the rating in a decade.
Only 5 other corporations in the United States held such a rating at that time.
Microsoft reported a record revenue of roughly $1billion for 2Q10, a 14% increase from 2Q09  .
Top-line growth was driven by the well-hyped release of its new operating system, Windows 7, which was launched globally October 2009 and sold more than 60 million copies in 2Q10, making it the fastest selling operating system in history  .
2 million XBOX 360 consoles  .
Its Online Services Division witnessed a 5% YoY decline, hurt by a 2% decline in online advertising revenue and the negative impact international rate declines took on its display revenue.
66 billion for the quarter, a 60% increase over 2Q09.
This disciplined cost-cutting dates back to FY2009, when MSFT reduced general and administrative expenses by 28% to offset the weakness in the global PC and server market that was plaguing its revenue growth  .
8 billion of which it returned to investors.
Client  28% of revenue and 45% of net income in FY2009: The client segment, accounting for approximately 28% of total revenue, includes sales and marketing expenses for the Windows operating system.
80% of this revenue is from the sale of products with pre-install versions of Windows operating systems.
9] In an effort to strengthen its grip on the PC market, Microsoft launched Windows 7 on October 22, 2009 replacing its disappointing Vista, which had been released three years earlier.
Vista frustrated many home users and turned off business customers due to its sluggishness, intrusiveness, and incompatibility with many gadgets.
Windows 7 is faster, less cluttered, and has new touch-screen features, while keeping Vista’s security and stability  .
Server and Tools - Products for IT Professionals  22% of revenue and 16% of net income in FY2009 : The Server and Tools segment, which accounts for approximately 22% of Microsoft’s revenue, develops and markets software server products, services, and solutions such as Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008.
Approximately 45% of Server and Tools revenue comes from multi-year licensing agreements, 25% through fully packaged product and transactional volume licensing programs, and 10% from licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers  OEMs .
Business  32% of revenue and 42% of net income in FY2009 : Microsoft Business Division  “MBD” , accounting for approximately 32% of Microsoft’s revenue, includes the Microsoft Office system  about 90% of MBD revenue  and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions.
Approximately 80% of MBD revenue is generated from sales to businesses, the rest being derived from sales to consumers.
Online Services  5% of revenue and -4% of net income in FY2009 : The Online Services Business  “OSB” , approximately 5% of Microsoft’s revenue, consists of an on-line advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, personal communications services such as email and instant messaging, online information offerings such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world.
14] In 2008, this included new releases of Windows Live Search, the Windows Live suite of applications and services, and their MSN Video Service.
Revenue comes primarily from online advertising .
Entertainment and Devices  13% of revenue and 1% of net income in FY2009 : Approximately 13% of total revenue, Entertainment and Devices is the most high-profile aspect of Microsoft’s expansion.
E&D includes the highly successful Xbox and Xbox 360 video game consoles , a large collection of Microsoft-licensed video and computer game titles  including Halo and the Age of Empires series , Windows Mobile and Automotive  operating systems for mobile and car navigation devices , and the Zune MP3 player  .
In June 2010, Microsoft released a slimmer version of the console known as the Xbox 360 Slim, in an effort to lower its production costs and compete with the smaller consoles of rivals such as Sony , who had great success with the launch of its re-designed Play Station 3  .
The company also said that starting November 2010, Xbox 360 releases will come equipped with Kinect, a body movement-sensitive add-on peripheral   .
In May 2010, Microsoft released two phones under the Microsoft brand in an attempt to target teenagers and facilitate social networking access.
In contrast to focusing on building its phone around third party applications, it strives for simplicity by merely integrating popular social features, such as Facebook, Twitter, RSS feeds, etc  .
These phones, manufactured by Sharp Corp.
Verizon Wireless , were not compatible with applications written for the previous operating systems, in an effort to maximize functionality and user friendliness  .
Less than two months in the market, Microsoft ended production of the Kin smartphones in June 2010, announcing that it would instead merge its Kin team with the WIndows Phone 7 team  .
Analysts blame the already saturated smartphone market and several other competing releases for the Kin s lack of success  it is rumored based on insider information that only 503 Kins were sold   .
The growth of SaaS means there is more competition for traditional Microsoft products like Microsoft Office.
Browser-based software represented approximately 5 percent of business software revenue in 2005 and, by 2011, 25 percent of new business software will be delivered as SaaS, according to Gartner, Inc.
23] Although shareware, open-source , or low-cost alternative software  like Google  GOOG  Apps, and Open Office by Sun Microsystems   are still several years away from the security and functionality most businesses need, analysts agree that software will continue to move towards these browser-based models in the long term.
Microsoft is taking steps to benefit from this trend itself, starting with the release of a new version of its Microsoft Exchange Server that is available on demand.
Furthermore, the next Office suite will be available as On Demand on the internet .
Another trend, the shift from client-server to Service-Oriented Architecture  SOA , marks the further and parallel movement of the server industry in the direction of On Demand.
Here, the companies that may stand to benefit the most are those with solid bases in the small-to-medium business market, such as Oracle  ORCL  .
Linux software distributor Red Hat may also benefit significantly, since the resulting restructuring of the software industry could mean a revival of interest in open-source alternatives.
Microsoft may have a lot of ground to make up in this area.
Microsoft has a history of running afoul of anti-trust laws .
In July of 2006, the company was fined US$356 million by the European Union in response to a 2004 antitrust ruling.
4 billion  €899 million  as compared with $511 million of legal charges during the prior year.
Given its monopolistic prominence, Microsoft is always under a slew of lawsuits, and this can affect the company s profitability, business strategy, and public image.
Potential legal problems can have a variety of impacts, from negative publicity to fines to possible forced reorganization of the company.
Microsoft, like other companies with proprietary operating systems, is able to unify its app development across its video game and mobile technology segments.
These cross-platform games can run on the XBox, Windows, and Windows Phone 7, with the code being 90% compatible across each of the platforms.
One is able to save the game on one platform and resume it on another  .
This eases developers  access to consumers and does not force them to pick one platform over another.
It also incentivizes them to build relationships with Microsoft over those of competitors  not offering similar cross-platform functionality.
Apple and Oracle : in the world of operating systems, Oracle is a far greater threat to Microsoft than Apple .
Despite consumer migration towards Apple desktops and netbooks, especially in the younger generations, Apple is lacking Microsoft s Windows in most corporate environments.
However, Oracle is a different story and stands poised to challenge Microsoft, both obliquely through its support of Lintel   Linux OS plus Intel processor chips , and directly in replacing Microsoft s developer base with its own improved Linux-based developer platform .
Google is Microsoft s primary competitors in Internet Services outperforming Microsoft by a wide margin.
In an effort to stiffen competition in this field, Microsoft signed a ten-year partnership with Yahoo!
February 2010 to use  the Bing search engine on Yahoo s site while Yahoo focuses its internal personnel on a more aggressive sales effort  .
Under the terms of the revenue-sharing agreement, Yahoo will receive 78% of the search revenue generated from Microsoft s sites during the first 5 years of the agreement and 88% of search revenue generated from Yahoo s sites.
This leaves Microsoft with 10% of the search advertising business to Google s 90%  .
Google also competes with Microsoft through its cloud-computing based software offerings.
Sony and Nintendo : Microsoft s two primary competitors in the Entertainment & Devices sector are the Nintendo Wii and the Sony Play Station 3.
Following the announcement of the cutting-edge Kinect peripheral device to the Xbox 360, Sony plans to release Move, its own body movement-sensitive add-on to the Play Station 3, while Nintendo plans to release a new  version of its DS handheld device that does not make use of 3-D goggles  .
Other competitors include SAP  servers , Red Hat  Linux software , Symantec  Internet Security  and Cisco  internet telephony .
In the non-commercial sector, there are significant forces at work which have slowly but importantly been reshaping the character and depth of product offerings which provide viable alternatives to Microsoft products with powerful, free operating systems software, language translators, editors, and utility programs numbering in the thousands, particularly attractive to sophisticated users.
These applications are in use by millions of users around the world.
What their overall impact is on Microsoft is difficult to guage, but their influence on the user community is not inconsequential and will only grow over time.

As we shared in May , Microsoft is prioritizing helping users stay up-to-date with the latest version of Internet Explorer.
Today we would like to share important information on migration resources, upgrade guidance, and details on support timelines to help you plan for moving to the latest Internet Explorer browser for your operating system.
Running a modern browser is more important than ever for the fastest, most secure experience on the latest Web sites and services, connecting anytime, anywhere, on any device.
Developers benefit when users stay current on the latest Web browser.
Older browsers may not support modern Web standards, so browser fragmentation is a problem for Web site developers.
Web app developers, too, can work more efficiently and create better products and product roadmaps if their customers are using modern browsers.
Upgrading benefits the developer ecosystem.
Users also benefit from a modern browser that enables the latest digital work and life experiences while decreasing online risks.
Improved Security – Outdated browsers represent a major challenge in keeping the Web ecosystem safer and more secure, as modern Web browsers have better security protection.
Internet Explorer 11 includes features like Enhanced Protected Mode to help keep customers safer.
Microsoft proactively fixes many potential vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, and our work to help protect customers is delivering results: According to NSS Labs, protection against malicious software increased from 69% on Internet Explorer 8 in 2009 to over 99% on Internet Explorer 11 .
It should come as no surprise that the most recent, fully-patched version of Internet Explorer is more secure than older versions.
Productivity – The latest Internet Explorer is faster, supports more modern Web standards, and has better compatibility with existing Web apps.
Users benefit by being able to run today’s Web sites and services, such as Office 365, alongside legacy Web apps.
1 Update and the latest Windows tablets and other devices, unlocking the next generation of technology and productivity.
Microsoft recommends enabling automatic updates to ensure an up-to-date computing experience—including the latest version of Internet Explorer—and most consumers use automatic updates today.
Commercial customers are encouraged to test and accept updates quickly, especially security updates.
Regular updates provide significant benefits, such as decreased security risk and increased reliability, and Windows Update can automatically install updates for Internet Explorer and Windows.
For customers not yet running the latest browser available for your operating system, we encourage you to upgrade and stay up-to-date for a faster, more secure browsing experience.
After January 12, 2016, only the most recent version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical support and security updates.
For example, customers using Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, or Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 7 SP1 should migrate to Internet Explorer 11 to continue receiving security updates and technical support.
For more details regarding support timelines on Windows and Windows Embedded, see the Microsoft Support Lifecycle site .
As some commercial customers have standardized on earlier versions of Internet Explorer, Microsoft is introducing new features and resources to help customers upgrade and stay current on the latest browser.
Customers should plan for upgrading to modern standards—to benefit from the additional performance, security, and productivity of modern Web apps—but in the short term, backward compatibility with legacy Web apps may be a cost-effective, if temporary, path.
Today we are announcing that Enterprise Mode will be supported through the duration of the operating system lifecycle, to help customers extend their existing Web app investments while staying current on the latest version of Internet Explorer.
On Windows 7, Enterprise Mode will be supported through January 14, 2020.
Microsoft will continue to improve Enterprise Mode backward compatibility, and to invest in tools and other resources to help customers upgrade and stay up-to-date on the latest version of Internet Explorer.

Microsoft’s new artificial intelligence system, Project Adam, can identify images, including photos of a particular breed of dog.
We’re entering a new age of artificial intelligence.
Drawing on the work of a clever cadre of academic researchers , the biggest names in tech—including Google, Facebook , Microsoft, and Apple—are embracing a more powerful form of AI known as “deep learning,” using it to improve everything from speech recognition and language translation to computer vision, the ability to identify images without human help.
In this new AI order, the general assumption is that Google is out in front.
The company now employs the researcher at the heart of the deep-learning movement, the University of Toronto’s Geoff Hinton .
It has openly discussed the real-world progress of its new AI technologies, including the way deep learning has revamped voice search on Android smartphones .
And these technologies hold several records for accuracy in speech recognition and computer vision.
But now, Microsoft’s research arm says it has achieved new records with a deep learning system it calls Adam, which will be publicly discussed for the first time during an academic summit this morning at the company’s Redmond, Washington headquarters.
According to Microsoft, Adam is twice as adept as previous systems at recognizing images—including, say, photos of a particular breed of dog or a type of vegetation—while using 30 times fewer machines  see video below .
Adam is an exploration on how you build the biggest brain,” says Peter Lee, the head of Microsoft Research.
The Project Adam team.
From left to right: Karthik Kalyanaraman, Trishul Chilimbi, Johnson Apacible, Yutaka Suzue.
Lee boasts that, when running a benchmark test called ImageNet 22K, the Adam neural network tops the  published  performance numbers of the Google Brain, a system that provides AI calculations to services across Google’s online empire, from Android voice recognition to Google Maps.
This test deals with a database of 22,000 types of images, and before Adam, only a handful of artificial intelligence models were able to handle this massive amount of input.
One of them was the Google Brain.
But Adam doesn’t aim to top Google with new deep-learning algorithms.
The trick is that the system better optimizes the way its machines handle data and fine-tunes the communications between them.
It’s the brainchild of a Microsoft researcher named Trishul Chilimbi, someone who’s trained not in the very academic world of artificial intelligence, but in the art of massive computing systems.
Like similar deep learning systems, Adam runs across an array of standard computer servers, in this case machines offered up by Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service.
Deep learning aims to more closely mimic the way the brain works by creating neural networks—systems that behave, at least in some respects, like the networks of neurons in your brain—and typically, these neural nets require a large number of servers.
The difference is that Adam makes use of a technique called asynchrony.
As computing systems get more and more complex, it gets more and more difficult to get their various parts to trade information with each other, but asynchrony can mitigate this problem.
Basically, asynchrony is about splitting a system into parts that can pretty much run independently of each other, before sharing their calculations and merging them into a whole.
The trouble is that although this can work well with smartphones and laptops—where calculations are spread across many different computer chips—it hasn’t been that successful with systems that run across many different servers, as neural nets do.
But various researchers and tech companies—including Google—have been playing around with large asynchronous systems for years now, and inside Adam, Microsoft is taking advantage of this work using a technology developed at the University of Wisconsin called, of all things, “ HOGWILD!
HOGWILD!
Different chips could even write to the same memory location, and nothing would stop them from overwriting each other.
With most systems, that’s considered a bad idea because it can result in data collisions—where one machine overwrites what another has done—but it can work well in some situations.
The chance of data collision is rather low in small computing systems, and as the University of Wisconsin researchers show, it can lead to significant speed-ups in a single machine.
Adam then takes this idea one step further, applying the asynchrony of HOGWILD!
We’re even wilder than HOGWILD!
Chilimbi, the Microsoft researcher who dreamed up the Adam project.
Although neural nets are extremely dense and the risk of data collision is high, this approach works because the collisions tend to result in the same calculation that would have been reached if the system had carefully avoided any collisions.
This is because, when each machine updates the master server, the update tends to be additive.
Rather than carefully controlling which machine updates the value first, the system just lets each of them update it whenever they can.
Microsoft says this setup can actually help its neural networks more quickly and more accurately train themselves to understand things like images.
It’s an aggressive strategy, but I do see why this could save a lot of computation,” says Andrew Ng, a noted deep-learning expert who now works for Chinese search giant Baidu .
An example of how Adam works.
Ng is surprised that Adam runs on traditional computer processors and not GPUs—the chips originally designed for graphics processing that are now used for all sorts of other math-heavy calculations.
Many deep learning systems are now moving to GPUs as a way of avoiding communications bottlenecks, but the whole point of Adam, says Chilimbi, is that it takes a different route.
Neural nets thrive on massive amounts of data—more data than you can typically handle with a standard computer chip, or CPU.
That’s why they get spread across so many machines.
Another option, however, is to run things on GPUs, which can crunch the data more quickly.
The problem is that if the AI model doesn’t fit entirely on one GPU card or a single server running several GPUs, the system can stall.
That’s why, some experts say, GPUs aren’t ideal right now for scaling up very large neural nets.
Chilimbi, who helped design the vast array of hardware and software that underpins Microsoft’s Bing search engine, is among them.
Should We Go HOGWILD?
Microsoft is selling Adam as a “mind-blowing system,” but some deep-learning experts argue that the way the system is built really isn’t all that different from Google’s.
Without knowing more details about how they optimize the network, experts say, it’s hard to know how Chilimbi and his team achieved the boosts in performance they are claiming.
Microsoft’s results are “kind of going against what people in research have been finding, but that’s what makes it interesting,” says Matt Zeiler, who worked on the Google Brain and recently started his own deep-learning company Clarifai .
He’s referring to the fact that the accuracy of Adam increases as they add more machines.
I definitely think more research on HOGWILD!
So far, it’s only been deployed through an internal app that will identify an object after you’ve snapped a photo of it with your mobile phone.
Lee has used it himself to identify dog breeds and bugs that might be poisonous.
There’s not a clear plan to release the app to the public yet, but Lee sees definite uses for the underlying technology in e-commerce, robotics, and sentiment analysis .
There’s also talks within Microsoft of exploring whether Adam’s efficiency could improve if run on field-programmable arrays, or FPGAs, processors that can be modified to run custom software.
Microsoft has already been experimenting with these chips to improve Bing .
Lee believes Adam could be part of what he calls an “ultimate machine intelligence,” something that could function in ways that are closer to how we humans handle different types of modalities—like speech, vision, and text—all at once.
The road to that kind of technology is long—people have been working towards it since the 50s—but we’re certainly getting closer.

This blog is Part 2 of a series about mapping a drive letter to your OneDrive account.
In Part 1 of this series, I showed you how to map a drive letter to your OneDrive account when you are using standard security, and in this blog I will show you how to map a drive letter to your OneDrive account after you have enabled two-step verification for your account security.
NET articles about WebDAV, you will see that I often use the WebDAV Redirector that is built-in to Windows in order to connect to various WebDAV websites.
This allows me to access my files via a mapped drive letter, which also enables me to use WebDAV with applications that do not have native WebDAV support.
Okay, this bit me again today, and I didn&#8217;t remember the solution from previous research so I had to research it again.
That to me means I need to write it up in a blog post.
