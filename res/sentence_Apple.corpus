It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff  s  rainbow Apple , the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.
The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.
Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.
On August 27, 1999   the following year after the iMac G3 was introduced , Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising.

In 2010, Climate Counts , a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category  Striding .
This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a  stuck icon , adding that Apple at the time was  a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer .
Greenpeace has campaigned against Apple because of various environmental issues, including a global end-of-life take-back plan, non-recyclable hardware components and toxins within iPhone hardware.
Since 2003 Greenpeace has campaigned against Apple s use of particular chemicals in its products, more specifically, the inclusion of PVC and BFRs in their devices.
In the first edition of the Greenpeace  Green Electronics Guide , released in August 2006, Apple only scored 2.
The Environmental Protection Agency rates Apple highest amongst producers of notebooks, and fairly well compared to producers of desktop computers and LCD displays .
In June 2007, Apple upgraded the MacBook Pro , replacing cold cathode fluorescent lamp  CCFL  backlit LCD displays with mercury -free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic -free glass,  and has since done this for all notebooks.
In June 2009, Apple s iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, BFRs and had an efficient power adapter.
In October 2009, Apple upgraded the iMac and MacBook, replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp  CCFL  backlit LCD displays with mercury-free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass.

Get answers to frequently asked questions about two-step verification for Apple ID.
What is two-step verification for Apple ID?
Two-step verification is an additional security feature for your Apple ID that s designed to prevent anyone from accessing or using your account, even if they know your password.
Why should I use two-step verification with my Apple ID?
Your Apple ID is the key to many things you do with Apple.
Two-step verification is a feature you can use to keep your Apple ID and personal information as secure as possible.
Then, any time you sign in to manage your Apple ID at My Apple ID , sign in to iCloud, or make an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase from a new device, you ll need to verify your identity by entering both your password and a 4-digit verification code, as shown below.
What if I want to sign in to iCloud using an app that doesn’t support two-step verification for Apple ID?
Two-step verification simplifies and strengthens the security of your Apple ID.
What if I forget my Apple ID password?
If you no longer have access to one of your devices, go to My Apple ID as soon as possible to remove that device from your list of trusted devices.
As a basic security measure, Apple doesn t allow setup of two-step verification to proceed if significant changes were recently made to your Apple ID account information.
This waiting period helps Apple make sure that you are the only person accessing or modifying your account.
While you are in this waiting period, you can continue using your account as usual with all Apple services and stores.
Apple will send an email to all the addresses you have on file notifying you of the waiting period and encouraging you to contact Apple Support if you think that someone else has unauthorized access to your account.
You can set up two-step verification after the date listed on your Apple ID account page and in the email that you receive.
When additional countries are added, two-step verification automatically appears in the Password and Security section of your account when you sign in to My Apple ID .

Oct 2014: Tim Cook on smartwatches, how Apple Pay activated 1m cards in 72 hours, and why Apple killed the iPod Classic.
Founded in Cupertino, California in 1976 by Steve Jobs , Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple Inc.
Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.
We couldn t get the parts anymore, not anywhere on Earth,  Apple CEO Tim Cook said.
Cook called Apple Pay a tremendous success even in its first week, and revealed that there had been 1 million credit cards activated on the system in its first 72 hours.
There is little chance that the Apple will ever dethrone Samsung as the market leader in South Korea, but now that the iPhone is available in a larger size, it may be able to capture more users in a previously less enthusiastic market.
AT&T will lock the Apple SIM card in the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3, even though the card is intended to allow users to switch networks at will.
It s been quite the year of ups and downs for Apple: From the unveiling of the Apple Watch to the disastrous iOS 8.
But things seem to be going more smoothly for Apple this week, as the company stock hit an all-time high this week.
It s safe to say, though, through the peaks and valleys of 2014, it s been quite a year for Apple.
Someone dropped a lot of money on an Apple computer, and it has nothing to do with the fancy new 5K Retina iMac.
MasterCard has rolled out its first Apple Pay commercials using America s favorite pastime, baseball, to introduce the new technology.
Two days after reporting strong fiscal 2014 fourth-quarter earnings, Apple s stock price hit a new all-time high of $103.

Remember back in June when I said Apple hoped to schedule a special event in October to show off a new wearable device?
The new device will, predictably, make good use of Apple’s HealthKit health and fitness platform.
Sure would be nice to turn the lights on and off from my wrist, though — or navigate my Apple TV  caution: Total speculation .
With its best product pipeline in 25 years , Apple should have more than enough hardware to fill two events.
In 1981, Apple brought its first external hard drive to market, the ProFile .
Bloomberg, like the Wall Street Journal before it — and Korean news site ET News before them both — says Apple is planning to field a new iPad with a display that measures 12.
If Apple CEO Tim Cook can do 80 percent of his job on a 9.
No, Apple really needs to start setting aside the multi-millions of dollars that WILL be needed to settle myriad lawsuits over their crappy security   .
Maybe that Apple announcement for wearable accessories is what caused the huge spike in the stock today.
CVS follows Rite-Aid, shuts off Apple Pay Drug store giants may be joining with other major retailers in developing a competing mobile wallet.
RAD  reportedly stopped accepting payments made through the just launched Apple Pay system from Apple  AAPL  .
The issue appears to be a conflict between Apple Pay and a mobile payment system called CurrentC that is being developed by a retailer-owned mobile technology outfit called Merchant Customer Exchange   MCX  .
Unlike Apple Pay, CurrentC does not use an NFC chip, but instead generates a QR code that is displayed on the merchant s checkout terminal.
When Apple announced Apple Pay in early September, both Wal-Mart Stores  WMT   and Best Buy  BBY  said they had no plans to adopt the new system.
That kind of attitude ought to help drive adoption of Apple Pay as well, but retailers have an investment in CurrentC and the system has begun real-world testing and is scheduled to go live early next year.
The advantage of CurrentC is that it works with existing checkout terminals, while Apple Pay requires that most retailers purchase new equipment to communicate with the NFC chip in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
Among the retailers that do not need to buy new terminals are Best Buy, Rite Aid, and CVS, so their reason for shutting down access to Apple Pay is very likely contractual or an act of solidarity with their fellow CurrentC backers.
If, as most observers expect, customer demand for NFC-based systems like Apple Pay grows rapidly, these retailers are not going to adopt a  my way or the highway  attitude with their customers.
And one other thing retailers have — or should have learned — is not to underestimate the power of Apple in the consumer world.

The move, announced with the publication of a new privacy policy tied to the release of Apple’s latest mobile operating system, iOS 8, amounts to an engineering solution to a legal quandary: Rather than comply with binding court orders, Apple has reworked its latest encryption in a way that prevents the company — or anyone but the device’s owner — from gaining access to the vast troves of user data typically stored on smartphones or tablet computers.
The key is the encryption that Apple mobile devices automatically put in place when a user selects a passcode, making it difficult for anyone who lacks that passcode to access the information within, including photos, e-mails and recordings.
Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data,” Apple said on its Web site.
As the new operating system becomes widely deployed over the next several weeks, the number of iPhones and iPads that Apple is capable of breaking into for police will steadily dwindle to the point where only devices several years old — and incapable of running iOS 8 — can be unlocked by Apple.
The move is the latest in a series in which Apple has sought to distinguish itself from competitors through more rigorous security, especially in the aftermath of revelations about government spying made by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden last year.
Although the company’s security took a publicity hit with the leak of intimate photos of celebrities from their Apple accounts in recent weeks, the move to block police access to the latest iPhones and iPads will thrill privacy activists and frustrate law enforcement officials, who have come to rely on the extensive evidence often found on personal electronic devices.
Particularly after the Snowden disclosures, Apple seems to understand that consumers want companies to put their privacy first.
Hosko, the former head of the FBI’s criminal investigative division, called the move by Apple “problematic,” saying it will contribute to the steady decrease of law enforcement’s ability to collect key evidence — to solve crimes and prevent them.
Security experts generally consider Apple’s devices to be better protected against such attacks than some rivals’, although people with short passcodes — of four digits, for example — are in greater danger of what are called “brute force attacks” that relentlessly try all possible combinations.
People who forget their passcodes with iOS 8 will not be able to recover them by contacting Apple.

After his death in 2011, Tim Cook, his friend and successor as Apple   AAPL   chief executive officer, decided to leave the sparsely decorated room on the fourth floor of 1 Infinite Loop untouched.
Almost everything else on Apple’s campus in Cupertino, Calif.
The executive wing once radiated nervous energy, with handlers scurrying to anticipate the whims of Apple’s temperamental co-founder.
Then Tim Cook took the stage at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts and laid out much of what Apple has been working on over the past three years.
The immediate aftermath is that Apple is swamped by a record number of preorders for the new iPhone 6 and supersize 6 Plus .
Bank of America   BAC  , Capital One   COF  , JPMorgan Chase   JPM  , and Wells Fargo   WFC  , among other banks, plus the major credit card companies and a number of nationwide retailers, have embraced the new mobile payment system, Apple Pay.
Even the Apple Watch, the company’s first attempt at launching an entirely new product category in the Cook era, has garnered an encouraging early response, though it will face the only test that matters when it hits stores sometime in 2015.
Anybody coming out of there yesterday knows that innovation is alive and well in Cupertino,” he says, rocking back and forth in a conference-room chair next to his office, an Apple Watch on his wrist.
When Cook took over from Jobs three years ago, the chances he could continue Apple’s epic run appeared slim.
The iPhone accounted for more than half of Apple’s revenue and the bulk of its gross profit.
At the same time the rise of phones made by Samsung Electronics   005930:KS   and other companies that ran Google’s   GOOG   free Android operating system had left Apple with a shrinking stake of the smartphone market.
A huge part of Apple’s business hinged on what seemed like a doomed strategy, evoking its defeat to Microsoft   MSFT   Windows in the PC battle of the 1980s and ’90s.
Cook didn’t take control of Apple under anything like ideal circumstances.
Even though Tim accepted the responsibility of being CEO with all the enthusiasm you’d expect,” says Robert Iger, Walt Disney’s   DIS   CEO and a member of Apple’s board, “it was dampened by a very deep sense of mourning.
Forstall had led software development for the iPad and iPhone; he was also divisive and responsible for the poorly received Apple Maps and Siri voice recognition service.
There was an audible gasp in Apple’s offices when the dismissal was announced, say people who were there.
Jonathan Ive, Apple’s head of design, was given control over the look and feel of iOS while development of the mobile operating system was consolidated with Mac software under Craig Federighi, the senior vice president for software engineering.
He bounds toward Apple employees, posing for on-campus selfies and answering every question regardless of the holes it eats into his schedule.
It’s easy to project this unfailing politeness onto Apple and deduce that the CEO’s demeanor has trickled down to the corporate ethos.
The result is only now becoming apparent with services that work across different Apple devices.
Embedded in the iPhone 6 and the new iOS 8 and Mac OS X Yosemite operating system is a feature called Continuity, which lets users start an e-mail or some other task on their Mac, pick it up on their iPhone, and then move it to their iPad or even the Apple Watch.
The things we should be doing at Apple are things that others can’t.
With the Apple Pay service, users will be able to touch their finger to the Touch ID finger scanner on their iPhone, tap their handset against a credit card terminal, and make a payment without having to turn on their phone or open an app.
Products such as iCloud, iTunes, and Siri lack the intuitive polish of Apple’s devices, and customers aren’t likely to be as forgiving when the stakes are raised from organizing photos to ensuring the security of their financial transactions.
Led by Jennifer Bailey, a vice president who had overseen Apple’s online store, the company started pitching this system early last year to banks, credit card companies, and retailers as more secure, more intuitive, and, unlike previous mobile payment systems, more likely to actually be used by tens of millions of iPhone owners.
As a result, Apple signed up the largest banks, credit card companies, and national chains such as McDonald’s   MCD   and Walgreen   WAG  .
He says he left because Apple grew too large and that products once created in small groups are now done in sprawling teams.
Excuse my September allergies,” says Jony Ive, rubbing his nose as he settles into a black leather seat in Apple’s executive offices.
With an Apple Watch wrapped around his hand brass-knuckle style, Ive reveals that the project was conceived in his lab three years ago, shortly after Jobs’s death and before “wearables” became a buzzword in Silicon Valley.
There are numerous reasons for this—the complexity of the engineering, the need for new physical interactions between the watch and the human body—but the one most pertinent to Ive is that the Apple Watch is the first Apple product that looks more like the past than the future.
Fléchon says only that the “discussion included the philosophy of instruments for measuring time” and notes that the Apple Watch may not be as timeless as some classic Swiss watches: “The evolution of the technologies will render very quickly the Apple Watch obsolete,” he says.
A year into the project, the group started toying with what became the Apple Watch’s defining physical feature: “the digital crown,” a variation on the knob that’s used to wind and set the time on a traditional wristwatch.
By pressing or rotating the crown, Apple Watch users can return to the home screen, zoom in or out, and scroll through apps.
By last summer, with Apple’s stock down by as much as 40 percent from a record high because of concerns about the lack of new products, Cook was ready to accelerate the project.
In the new Apple, he’s Tim Cook’s Tim Cook.
Metallurgists responsible for the casing for Macs and iPhones devised a stronger gold alloy for the premium model of the watch, and Apple’s algorithm scientists studied how to improve the accuracy of the watch’s heart rate sensor.
Williams is unapologetic about the Apple Watch missing the 2014 holiday season.
Critics of Apple—they do exist—say the watch’s user interface is confusing and that it’s not entirely clear whether there’s a “killer app” or what, if anything, the watch does better than a smartphone.
Photograph by Geordie Wood for Bloomberg BusinessweekCook says he wishes he could make the device more affordable, particularly since the company boasts of its potential to help customers manage their health and wellness  “that’s the humanitarian coming out” , but he won’t compromise Apple’s large profit margins to make it happen.
At Apple’s March shareholder meeting, a representative from the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research questioned Cook on Apple’s commitment to making its factories carbon neutral and removing harmful chemicals from its products.
Last year Cook hired Lisa Jackson, the former director of the Environmental Protection Agency, to lead Apple’s environmental initiatives.
Jobs sometimes gestured toward caring about stuff like Apple’s climate impact, too—when he wasn’t dismissing it as “bulls-‍-‍-,” as he did in 2005 in response to criticism that the company didn’t do enough to limit the chemicals in its products or make them more recyclable.
One of Cook’s mantras is that Apple should “default to open” on issues of corporate responsibility and engage on causes that are important to customers.
In the old Apple, “it was the ‘just be quiet, just say nothing, only talk about things that are completed,’” Cook says.
Alas, that transparency stops at Apple’s product plans.
In August, Apple released its internal diversity report.
There’s another kind of openness at Apple as well.
The deal was an acknowledgment that Apple needs to find new ways to sell its devices, particularly the iPad, which accounted for 20 percent of its sales last year and has hit a surprising slump in recent quarters.
Cook had decided that Apple needed more corporate customers but didn’t want to add the requisite army of buttoned-up salespeople.
The carriers say Apple under Cook can still be imposing and secretive, though now there’s more of a personal touch.
Over the last few months, the company’s gone on a hiring spree, vacuuming up accomplished tastemakers such as Patrick Pruniaux, the chief salesman at watchmaker Tag Heuer; Paul Deneve, the former CEO of couture house Yves Saint Laurent; and Angela Ahrendts, Burberry’s   BRBY:LN   former chief executive, who joined Apple to run its stores.
Cook “is very focused on finding a very wide range of people,” says Susan Wagner, founding partner and director of asset-management firm BlackRock   BLK  , Apple’s largest shareholder, who joined the company’s board earlier this summer.
Dre, the hip-hop impresario, when Apple acquired their company, Beats Electronics, in May for $3 billion, the biggest acquisition in the company’s history.
In Beats, Apple got a business in fashionable  some might say overpriced  headphones and wireless speakers that brought in more than a billion dollars in revenue last year.
Yet Cook says he bought the company for another reason—to enlist its brokers of cool to help Apple reestablish its core franchise in digital music amid the decline of single track downloads on iTunes and the rise of streaming music services such as Pandora   P  .
The recording industry desperately needs a delivery system that is as compelling as the music,” says Iovine, nestled among celebrities and journalists after Apple’s product introduction in the blindingly white demo hall that the company constructed next to the Flint Center.
Cook concedes that consumers will issue the ultimate verdict on the Apple Watch, his biggest bet so far as chief executive.
If consumers are befuddled or ambivalent, the questions about his product chops, and Apple’s ability to innovate, will return with a new ferocity.
He’s also likely to face challenges retaining Apple’s top talent.
Some former Apple executives think Ive could be inching toward the door and interpret the recent hiring of celebrity designer Marc Newson , Ive’s friend, as evidence he may be staying put for now.
An Apple spokeswoman declines to comment on Ive’s plans, and Schiller says the team is staying together.
A lot of us at Apple are here because we love the products,” he says.
CNBC s Josh Lipton talks to Apple CEO Tim Cook about his company s new partnership with IBM, which will make busniess apps exclusively for iPads and iPhones.
Tech behemoths Apple and IBM announced a partnership Tuesday that could make Apple—traditionally a consumer brand—a major player in the business market.
IBM said it would create a class of more than 100 business applications exclusively for iPhones and iPads to run on Apple s iOS platform.
In return, IBM will sell Apple s products with 100 industry-specific apps to its clients worldwide.
In return, Apple s vaunted AppleCare service would provide support for these applications.
The partnership is about  transforming enterprise,  Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC in an exclusive interview.
The company also launched a version of its office software for Apple s iPad earlier in the year.

Before customers get their first chance to see or touch a new Apple product, the company has carefully orchestrated almost every one of its public appearances: controlled leaks and advance briefings for favored writers, an invite-only media debut, and a special early review process for a group of pre-screened, known-positive writers.
Nothing is left to chance, and in the rare case where Apple doesn’t control the initial message, it remedies that by using proxies to deliver carefully crafted, off-the-record responses.
Except for a few big exceptions, such as the memorably off-pitch quotes above, Apple’s “tell them what to believe” PR strategy has worked incredibly well for years.
But it has also created tensions between the company and the people who cover it, as well as within Apple itself.
The company’s long-time head of PR, Katie Cotton, left the company earlier this year as CEO Tim Cook openly sought to make a major change in the way Apple interacted with the press and its customers.
As the hunt for Cotton’s replacement is still in progress, and the depth of Apple’s commitment to change remains unclear, we look today at the techniques Apple has used to quietly manipulate its coverage over the years.
I am fine with Apple being opinionated.
For example, people complained mightily about Apple maps, but no one seemed to admit that Google maps had its share of errors.
There was no analysis in the press, just cherry-picked examples to highlight that some Apple maps were imperfect while ignoring the limitations of its competitors.
So was Apple right to say that it was an overblown issue?
I’d have to say yes, Apple was right, given the realities in the field.
No company in the world gets shit on by the press more than Apple.
Completely broken, but as always, Google gets a pass while Apple gets pooped on for the anything and everything.
Perhaps it’s because people demand Apple to create perfect experiences while knowing everyone else always comes short, and not demanding that of them.
Let’s hope more friendly PR now from Apple.
And after reading this full article, one question comes in mind is that Is this article written by 9to5mac or Apple PR team to leak upcoming changes in Apple PR team?
The anti-plastic snobbery isn’t really coming from Apple.
I’ve often suspected the company had Apple – controlled bloggers.
What Apple does is, unfortunately, not unique.
This was actually a good piece, if you can ignore the not so subtle anti-Apple vitriol.
I’m not surprised that Apple has a sophisticated PR team that helps get their message out, What company their size doesn’t?
If anything, it sounds like the writer is chronically butt hurt that he’s not in Apple’s “inside circle” – a notion that is evident in virtually every Apple-related tweet.
I think in the end, Steve Jobs–while he was a master salesman and in many ways a visionary–started to hurt Apple because his arrogant attitude on product design turned off a lot of people.
Today, it appears that Apple has finally begun to shed the PR problems that Jobs caused.
Note that Apple has really dialed down its legal cases against Android  with the exception of Samsung–but then, Samsung’s early touchscreen phones built between 2008 and 2010 as a response to the iPhone blatantly copied the iPhone in too many ways , and I really do believe that there may be an “behind the scenes” attempt by Apple and Google to settle the dispute once and for all–with an resolution coming in  my guess  early 2015.
My favorite anti-Apple rant was the MacBook Pro heat sink compound fiasco.
Seriously, interesting article-the part I will recall is simply: Apple is currently refreshing its PR department.
But I feel that the big picture of why Apple is so successful with PR is missing in your article: you name all the elements but don’t mention why it all works together, or what makes it different from the competition.
I feel frustrated reading your article because many things described look like any other company’s PR department, but you present it in a way that suggests that there’s something extraordinary just because it’s Apple.
While she might very well be a tyrant, her job is not to be nice, but to make people talk about Apple, and she managed in such a way that even writing an article about Apple’s own PR can create buzz!

Nothing is left to chance, and in the rare case where Apple doesn’t control the initial message, it remedies that by using proxies to deliver carefully crafted, off-the-record responses.
Except for a few big exceptions, such as the memorably off-pitch quotes above, Apple’s “tell them what to believe” PR strategy has worked incredibly well for years.
But it has also created tensions between the company and the people who cover it, as well as within Apple itself.
The company’s long-time head of PR, Katie Cotton, left the company earlier this year as CEO Tim Cook openly sought to make a major change in the way Apple interacted with the press and its customers.
As the hunt for Cotton’s replacement is still in progress, and the depth of Apple’s commitment to change remains unclear, we look today at the techniques Apple has used to quietly manipulate its coverage over the years.
I am fine with Apple being opinionated.
For example, people complained mightily about Apple maps, but no one seemed to admit that Google maps had its share of errors.
There was no analysis in the press, just cherry-picked examples to highlight that some Apple maps were imperfect while ignoring the limitations of its competitors.
So was Apple right to say that it was an overblown issue?
I’d have to say yes, Apple was right, given the realities in the field.
No company in the world gets shit on by the press more than Apple.
Completely broken, but as always, Google gets a pass while Apple gets pooped on for the anything and everything.
Perhaps it’s because people demand Apple to create perfect experiences while knowing everyone else always comes short, and not demanding that of them.
Let’s hope more friendly PR now from Apple.
And after reading this full article, one question comes in mind is that Is this article written by 9to5mac or Apple PR team to leak upcoming changes in Apple PR team?
The anti-plastic snobbery isn’t really coming from Apple.
I’ve often suspected the company had Apple – controlled bloggers.
What Apple does is, unfortunately, not unique.
This was actually a good piece, if you can ignore the not so subtle anti-Apple vitriol.
I’m not surprised that Apple has a sophisticated PR team that helps get their message out, What company their size doesn’t?
If anything, it sounds like the writer is chronically butt hurt that he’s not in Apple’s “inside circle” – a notion that is evident in virtually every Apple-related tweet.
I think in the end, Steve Jobs–while he was a master salesman and in many ways a visionary–started to hurt Apple because his arrogant attitude on product design turned off a lot of people.
Today, it appears that Apple has finally begun to shed the PR problems that Jobs caused.
Note that Apple has really dialed down its legal cases against Android  with the exception of Samsung–but then, Samsung’s early touchscreen phones built between 2008 and 2010 as a response to the iPhone blatantly copied the iPhone in too many ways , and I really do believe that there may be an “behind the scenes” attempt by Apple and Google to settle the dispute once and for all–with an resolution coming in  my guess  early 2015.
My favorite anti-Apple rant was the MacBook Pro heat sink compound fiasco.
Seriously, interesting article-the part I will recall is simply: Apple is currently refreshing its PR department.
But I feel that the big picture of why Apple is so successful with PR is missing in your article: you name all the elements but don’t mention why it all works together, or what makes it different from the competition.
I feel frustrated reading your article because many things described look like any other company’s PR department, but you present it in a way that suggests that there’s something extraordinary just because it’s Apple.
While she might very well be a tyrant, her job is not to be nice, but to make people talk about Apple, and she managed in such a way that even writing an article about Apple’s own PR can create buzz!





In one of the clearest signs that Apple is — and has been — working on a smartwatch device, the Cupertino company was on Tuesday granted a patent for a wrist-worn wearable with augmented strap capabilities, support for arm and wrist gestures, advanced proximity-sensing circuitry and much more.
Patent and Trademark Office, Apple s U.
What comes later in the patent, however, potentially reveals Apple s smartwatch aspirations.
The idea harkens back to the days of Apple s sixth-generation iPod nano, which spawned a cottage industry for ad-hoc solutions that turned the media player into a wristwatch-style device.
In fact, Apple s patent background alludes to the iPod nano by name.
Things start to get interesting when Apple describes what it calls a  personal wireless environment.
The remainder of Apple s patent looks at physical embodiments of the invention, many of which deal with connecting and securing a portable media player like the aforementioned iPod nano.
According to the most recent speculation, Apple s first foray into the wearables game may sport a   slightly curved   2.

Getting into Amazon let my hackers get into my Apple ID account, which helped them get into Gmail, which gave them access to Twitter.
But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Apple’s and Amazon’s.
Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information — a partial credit card number — that Apple used to release information.
In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification.
The very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the Web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification.
But the Apple rep didn’t bother to tell me about the first call concerning my account, despite the 90 minutes I spent on the phone with tech support.
Nor would Apple tech support ever tell me about the first call voluntarily — it only shared this information after I asked about it.
In response, Apple issued a temporary password.
One of the reasons it took me so long to get anything resolved with Apple during my initial phone call was because I couldn’t answer the security questions it had on file for me.
Perhaps an hour or so into the call, the Apple representative on the line said “Mr.
Once supplied, Apple will issue a temporary password, and that password grants access to iCloud.
We talked to Apple directly about its security policy, and company spokesperson Natalie Kerris told Wired, “Apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password.
By exploiting the customer service procedures employed by Apple and Amazon, hackers were able to get into iCloud and take over all of Mat Honan’s digital devices — and data.
My Google account was nuked, my Twitter account was suspended, my phone was in a useless state of restore, and  for obvious reasons  I was highly paranoid about using my Apple email account for communication.
If I had some other account aside from an Apple e-mail address, or had used two-factor authentication for Gmail, everything would have stopped here.
But using that Apple-run me.
You honestly can get into any email associated with apple,” Phobia claimed in an e-mail.
Since he already had the e-mail, all he needed was my billing address and the last four digits of my credit card number to have Apple’s tech support issue him the keys to my account.
But, as we know, Apple only needs those last four digits.
Find My iPhone has been a brilliant Apple service.
And so, when Apple introduced Find My Mac in the update to its Lion operating system last year, I added that to my iCloud options too.
And Apple would not comment as to whether stronger authentification is being considered.
If that is, in fact, the case — that I was the victim of Apple not following its own internal processes — then the problem is widespread.
And then there’s Apple.
I bought into the Apple account system originally to buy songs at 99 cents a pop, and over the years that same ID has evolved into a single point of entry that controls my phones, tablets, computers and data-driven life.
What s life really like designing for Apple?
Most of Apple s own employees aren t allowed inside Apple s fabled design studios.
So we re left piecing together interviews , or outright speculating about how Apple does it and what it s really like to be a designer at the company.
Before founding Storehouse , Kawano was a senior designer at Apple for seven years, where he worked on Aperture and iPhoto.
Later, Kawano became Apple s User Experience Evangelist, guiding third-party app iOS developers to create software that felt right on Apple s platforms.
Kawano was with the company during a critical moment, as Apple released the iPhone and created the wide world of apps.
Design, Kawano spoke frankly about his time at Apple--and especially wanted to address all the myths the industry has about the company and about its people.
I think the biggest misconception is this belief that the reason Apple products turn out to be designed better, and have a better user experience, or are sexier, or whatever .
People often observe that Steve Jobs brought this structure to Apple.
At Apple, it s kind of expected that experience is really important.
Kawano underscores that everyone at Apple--from the engineers to the marketers--is, to some extent, thinking like a designer.
Much like Google hires employees that think like Googlers, Apple hires employees that truly take design into consideration in all of their decisions.
You see companies that have poached Apple designers, and they come up with sexy interfaces or something interesting, but it doesn t necessarily move the needle for their business or their product.
But when Kawano was at Apple, its core software products were designed by a relatively small group of roughly 100 people.
For the most part, Apple didn t employ specialist designers.
And thanks to the fact that Apple hires design-centric engineers, the relatively skeleton design team could rely on engineers to begin the build process on a new app interface, rather than having to initiate their own mock-up first.
For Apple, having a small, really focused organization made a lot of sense when Steve was there, because so many ideas came from Steve.
As Apple shifted to much more of a company where there s multiple people at the top, I think it makes sense that they re growing the design team in interesting ways.
Kawano told us that Apple designers  and engineers!
But if you re imagining some giant vault of animation ideas hiding inside Apple and waiting to be discovered, you d be wrong.
There was a commonly shared piece of advice inside Apple--maybe you ve heard it before--that a designer should always take the stairs, because if you met Steve Jobs in the elevator, he d ask what you were up to.
People who thrived at Apple welcomed that passion from working with Steve.
The reality is, the people who thrived at Apple were the people who welcomed that desire and passion to learn from working with Steve, and just really were dedicated to the customer and the product.
I always find somewhat warm and relieved, when on Apple  Give thanks to everyone and their families  upon new product launch.
I don t know if or do Apple have the best design, I believe they took a very different approach from any other design marketing company, and their products stood out.
IMHO, they launched too many products and canabalized on their novelty factor, in which Apple gains huge points.
Recent research has shown that apple polyphenols can help prevent spikes in blood sugar through a variety of mechanisms.
In addition, the polyphenols in apple have been shown to lessen absorption of glucose from the digestive tract; to stimulate the beta cells of the pancreas to secrete insulin; and to increase uptake of glucose from the blood via stimulation of insulin receptors.
All of these mechanisms triggered by apple polyphenols can make it easier for you to regulate your blood sugar.
Even though apple is not an excellent source of dietary fiber  it ranks as a  good  source in our WHFoods Rating System , the fiber found in apple may combine with other apple nutrients to provide you with the kind of health benefits you would ordinarily only associate with much higher amounts of dietary fiber.
The fat-lowering effects of apple have traditionally been associated with its soluble fiber content, and in particular, with the soluble fiber portion of its polysaccharide component known as pectins.
Nevertheless, this relatively modest amount of pectins found in whole apples has now been shown to interact with other apple phytonutrients to give us the kind of blood fat lowering effects that would typically be associated with much higher amounts of soluble fiber intake.
In recent comparisons with laboratory animals, the blood fat lowering effects of whole apple were shown to be greatly reduced when whole apples were eliminated from the diet and replaced by pectins alone.
In summary, it s not fiber alone that explains the cardiovascular benefits of apple, but the interaction of fiber with other phytonutrients in this wonderful fruit.
Researchers have recently compared intake of whole apples to intake of applesauce and apple juice, only to discover that people report less hunger  and better satiety, or food satisfaction  after eating whole apples than after eating applesauce or drinking apple juice.
But especially interesting was an additional finding about calorie intake following apple consumption.
When healthy adults consumed one medium-sized apple approximately 15 minutes before a meal, their caloric intake at that meal decreased by an average of 15%.
Since meals in this study averaged 1,240 calories, a reduction of 15% meant a reduction of 186 calories, or about 60 more calories than contained in a medium apple.
For these researchers,  getting ahead  in calories with a net reduction of 60 calories was a welcomed outcome of the study, and an extra benefit to their study s primary conclusion—the importance of whole apples  versus other more processed apple forms  in helping us manage our hunger and feeling more satisfied with our food.
For example, due to bacterial changes in the large intestine, there appears to be more fuel available to the large intestine cells  in the form of butyric acid  after apple is consumed.
We expect to see future studies confirming these results in humans, and we are excited to think about potential health benefits of apple that will be related to its impact on bacterial balance in our digestive tract.
So there may be some truth to that old phrase,  An apple a day keeps the doctor away!
Still, we don t recommend that everyone eat one apple on a daily basis, given the wide variety of available fruits and the nutritional uniqueness of each type.
In the past five years, no area of apple research has been more dynamic than the area of apple polyphenols.
Kaempferol and myricetin are also important apple flavonols.
Chlorogenic acid is apple s primary phenolic acid, and it s found throughout the pulp and also in the skin.
When an apple is more uniformly red in color, or when its red color is deeper in hue, it s because there are more anthocyanins.
The flavonoid phloridzin accounts for 98% of the flavonoids found in the apple seeds.
The total polyphenol contents of apples range from about 1-7 grams kilogram of fresh pulp, but this ratio gets much higher in the skin, underscoring the special value of apple skins for deriving optimal polyphenol benefits from this fruit.
In fact, in animal studies, there is a very commonly used standardized apple extract called standardized apple peel polyphenol extract, or APPE.
Cells in the skin of apple that conduct photosynthesis are especially sensitive to UV-B light from the sun.
Many of the polyphenols in the skin of apples can actually absorb UV-B light, and thereby prevent UV-B from damaging the photosynthetic cells in the apple skin.
Polyphenols, then, are like the apple s natural sunscreen.
Inside the cells of apple skin and pulp are enzymes called polyphenol oxidases, or PPOs.
When the cells of the apple are sliced through or physically damaged when an apple is dropped, the PPOs start oxidizing the polyphenols in apples, and the result you see is a browning of the damaged apple portion.
This phenomenon is why people say that  one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch.
Once again, the problem of ethylene gas from apple bruising or other damage underscores the importance of handling this amazing fruit with tender loving care and removing any damaged apples from groups of apples stored in bulk.
Since most of the polyphenols in apples function as antioxidants, it s not surprising to see so many health benefit studies focusing on the antioxidant benefits from apple.
The cardiovascular benefits of apples are well-documented in research studies, and they are closely associated with two aspects of apple nutrients: their water-soluble fiber  pectin  content, and their unusual mix of polyphenols.
In some studies,  regular intake  has meant apple intake very close to the level of one whole fresh apple per day.
This area of research on apple benefits is relatively new, but it s already awakening the interest of an increasing number of food scientists.
By telling the beta cells of our pancreas to produce more insulin, the polyphenols found in apple can help us clear more sugar from our blood and keep our blood sugar level in better balance.
Although some preliminary results show apple benefits for several different cancer types  especially colon cancer and breast cancer , it s the area of lung cancer benefits that stand out in the apple research.
Multiple studies have shown apple intake to be associated with decreased risk of asthma.
The apple is actually a member of the Rose family, which may seem strange until we remember that roses make rose hips, which are fruits similar to the apple.
Tart apples, which best retain their texture during cooking, are often preferred for cooked desserts like apple pie, while Delicious apples and other sweeter varieties like Braeburn and Fuji apples are usually eaten raw.
The apple tree, which originally came from Eastern Europe and southwestern Asia, has spread to most temperate regions of the world.
Apples have long been associated with the biblical story of Adam and Eve, although there is actually no mention that, in fact, the fruit in question was actually an apple.
In Norse mythology, apples were given a more positive persona: a magic apple was said to keep people young forever.
Johnny Appleseed—a real person named John Chapman—walked barefoot across an area of 100,000 square miles, planting apple trees that provided food and a livelihood for generations of settlers.
In the northern hemisphere, apple season begins at the end of summer and lasts until early winter.
Whole apples are a much better nutritional choice than apple juice.
You ve no doubt heard the saying,  one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch.
An apple that has been bruised from being dropped  or that has been damaged in some other way  will start to release unusual amounts of ethylene gas.
The skin of the apple is unusually rich in nutrients, and even if the recipe you ve chosen requires peeled apples, consider leaving the skins on to receive the unique benefits found in the skins.
If you cannot obtain organic apples, and you are willing to accept some level of risk related to consumption of residues on the apple skins, we believe that it can still be a good trade-off between nutrients and contaminants if you leave the skin of the apple intact and eat the apple unpeeled.
Just be sure to thoroughly rinse the entire apple under a stream of pure water while gently scrubbing the skin with a natural bristle brush for 10-15 seconds.
Some types of processing are easier on nutrients than others, but in general, apple sauces require boiling of apples and apple juices require some extraction of pulp.
In all cases, the more apple that can be retained, the better the resulting nourishment.
We ve seen recent studies where only 10% of the flavonols and 3% of the catechins from the original apples remained present in the processed apple juice, Even chlorogenic acid  one of the more stable polyphenols in apples  tends to be decreased by at least 50% during the processing of whole apples into juice.
However, this type of blending is not used in the commercial production of apple juice.
Commercial apple juices are typically either  clear  or  cloudy.
Clear apple juices have the vast majority of the apple pomace  pulpy apple solids  removed.
Cloudy apple juices typically retain some of these pulpy solids because even though the pulpy solids have been removed from the juice through pressing and filtering, they are added back in at some designated level.
When purchasing apple juice, always choose cloudy juices if possible.
Braise a chopped apple with red cabbage.
If you do purchase non-organic apples, you may want to ask your grocer about the kind of wax used to protect the apple s surface during storage or shipping.

TBWA Media Arts Lab was presenting fresh work to its signature client when the Apple executive across the table stopped the proceedings and handed over another idea, saying simply,  We like this better.
The favored ad was created by a rival agency: Apple s in-house shop.
Recounted by a creative who has worked on the brand recently, it s a scene that would have been unfathomable before the death of Apple s creative heart and soul, Steve Jobs, roughly two-and-a-half years ago.
But today Apple is thinking differently about its approach to advertising and marketing.
Amid criticisms that it has failed to innovate, Apple is increasingly taking marketing into its own hands.
And, in what once would have been seen as a sacrilegious breach of the Apple-MAL bond, it s been inviting some of the ad industry s top shops to pitch on major projects.
But interviews with at least two dozen current and former employees of Apple, TBWA MAL, ad-industry professionals approached by the company and those who have worked with Apple reveal a powerful brand searching to regain its creative edge.
Meanwhile, other tech marketers have eclipsed Apple with their creativity and cojones, a fact not lost on the Cupertino company.
An email to TBWA MAL President James Vincent from Apple Senior-VP Global Marketing Phil Schiller uncovered during the much-publicized patent lawsuit between the tech giant and rival Samsung said:  I watched the Samsung pre-Super Bowl ad that launched today.
In May, Google kicked Apple out of the top spot in BrandZ s annual ranking of Most Valuable Global brands, a position Apple held for three consecutive years.
In April, a Wall Street Journal article during the patent dispute between Apple and Samsung brought to light an early 2013 email from Mr.
Ad Age learned that since at least the beginning of 2013, Apple has been calling adland s hottest shops to work on various projects.
According to Co-Founder Chief Creative Officer PJ Pereira, Apple reached out to his agency over the past year for two projects, at least one of which would have been long-term.
People close to the situation say that Apple continues to call other top creative agencies in on projects.
Last fall, Ad Age reported that Apple was looking to build out its in-house team to 600 people from 300.
Today, according to a high-level agency exec recently approached, Apple has upped that number to a massive 1,000.
To staff its internal agency, Apple is casting its net wide.
One senior agency exec noted that within the same six-month period of being contacted by Apple, a number of other senior creative execs at both this person s agency and other shops had gotten calls.
Another upper-level agency exec was unclear as to how many posts Apple has been trying to fill, but said,  All I know is all my talented friends have been approached.
In addition to Apple s flagging creative reputation, another recruiting hurdle for the company is its cost-prohibitive location.
Just run property values, and even on an Apple salary, it would be tough.
To be sure, Apple still has plenty of appeal.
There are probably only a handful of places that have that level of expectation of quality and can afford to pay people to do work to make it successful,  said another exec contacted by Apple recruitment.
Executives close to the business said Apple has been beefing up production beyond Mr.
In April, branding agency Wolff Olins   Global CEO Karl Heiselman told Ad Age he would be joining Apple in a marketing-communications role.
Heiselman had been a design contractor at Apple in the 1990s before Mr.
Meanwhile, Apple has poached a number of former MAL staffers, including Creative Directors Hector Muelas and Ricardo Viramontes, and Creative Director Larry Corwin, who previously held creative director positions at Google, BBH , BBDO and Goodby Silverstein & Partners .
While hiring efforts are in full force, Apple has changed its approach to getting creative work as it continues to increase its ad spending.
Much of the purview over Apple advertising lies with Hiroki Asai, who came up at the company through package design -- and is said by one creative to be  the creative director of all things internal  who has  really evolved into this very powerful person  at Apple.
People familiar with the situation say it s under him that Apple has introduced -- or at least intensified -- a competitive dynamic between its in-house team and TBWA MAL through creative shootouts.
One creative who worked for Apple said the shootouts began last summer when the company was prepping to launch the iPhone 5C.
For instance, Apple s holiday ad, featuring a loner teen who seems to pull away from his family s holiday festivities but ultimately turned out to be creating a surprising gift, was assigned to Media Arts Lab.
TBWA MAL s work won, earning a lot of attention in the design and fanboy community for reclaiming Apple s authoritative voice.
One insider said  jump balls  have always been part of Apple s approach, but the process has become more apparent over the past year or so because, more often than not,  the internal teams have won.
For whatever reason, MAL is seen as part of the old way of doing things,  said a creative who has worked on Apple marketing.
They had Wednesday reviews, they d fly up to Apple and show work, and there was a process with Jobs.
Execs approached by Apple for internal jobs were told that TBWA MAL would continue to be part of the picture -- but in what capacity remains unclear.
Some say it will need to fill the service-side duties Apple can t handle internally.
Others paint a bleaker picture of the shop s future with Apple.
For now, however, it seems it will remain a creative player for Apple, but as part of a growing, more competitive and more comprehensive marketing mix.
One person close to the matter said Apple s in-house marketing leads have permission from Messrs.
Every Apple contractor, including TBWA MAL, is  max busy.
The broader creative picture shows that Apple is lining up as much talent -- on all fronts -- to inject innovation back into its game.
Outside of marketing and communication, in October of last year, Apple generated buzz when to revitalize retail it hired Angela Ahrendts, the Burberry CEO known for bringing the once-stodgy brand into the modern age with groundbreaking digital initiatives.
Big moves, all proving Apple s determination to up its game.
To borrow a phrase from Apple s  Intention  film,  there are 1,000 nos for every yes.
Anand Lal Shimpi, the editor and publisher of the well-regarded AnandTech site, is going to work at Apple.
An Apple rep confirmed that the company was hiring Shimpi, but wouldn’t provide any other details.

Apple   AAPL   on Tuesday introduced two new iPhones, its long-awaited Apple Watch and a mobile payment system as part of a marketing blitz aimed at drumming up consumer excitement.
Speaking from the Flint Performing Arts Center in Apple s hometown of Cupertino, Calif.
See CNET for complete coverage of Apple s product launch .
But Apple s new  offerings may be even more important, as the company seeks to  entice customers with an expanded lineup of products and services designed to keep them within its technological ecosystem.
To that end, Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the company s new mobile payments tool, called Apple Pay , which aims to let users make purchases from their iPhone or Apple Watch.
With Apple Pay, consumers can pay for goods without sharing credit card, address and other personal information with a merchant, Cook said.
Apple has teamed with financial industry heavyweights including American Express   AXP  , Mastercard   MA   and Visa   V   and says Apple Pay will work at more than 220,000 retailers nationwide.
Then, finally putting an end to months of rumors and speculation, Cook presented Apple s new wearable device, the Apple Watch , describing it as the  next chapter  in the company s history and a  breakthrough.
Apple CEO Tim Cook announces the Apple Watch during an Apple special event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts on Sept.
Ian Fogg, senior director for research firm IHS, said Apple wants to validate wearable gadgets in the same way the iPhone in 2007 established a mass market for smartphones.
This Apple Watch is a first-generation device, and whether it is  successful or not Apple will aim to iterate and make it a must-have  companion for every iPhone owner.
Although Apple has posted solid financial results this year, investors and even some of the company s famously rabid fans have seemed underwhelmed by recent product launches.
The last iPhones and iPads, while commercially successful, have been deemed only incremental advances -- pleasing refinements that remain well short of the big leaps forward Apple has made in the course of growing into the most valuable company in the world.
For Cook, the Apple Watch could prove either a canny move into a lucrative new product segment, or a dead end.
The gadget -- which fans referred to as the Apple iWatch as rumors intensified in recent months that a device was imminent --  is the first developed entirely under Cook s leadership since he succeeded Jobs as CEO in 2011.
For both Apple and other companies making smartwatches, it also represents a key test of consumer interest in a technology that to date has failed to dazzle customers.
A critical challenge for Apple, experts say: Building a device that -- like the iPod, iPhone and iPad before it -- compellingly fills a need users may not know they have.
No surprise, then, that Cook touted HealthKit, a software development tool that integrates health and fitness apps through the Apple Watch while giving consumers control over what health data they choose to share.
Indeed, until today Apple hadn t released a brand new product since launching the iPad four year ago.
In the interim, Apple s competitors have stormed into a range of areas ripe for innovation, with Google working to develop driverless cars and Facebook   FB   pushing the envelope on virtual reality.
That has raised concerns that, without Jobs, Apple risks losing the vision that powered its rise.
Perhaps more than any tech provider, Apple is under the gun to innovate.
Along with expanding into the wearable computing segment, Apple is developing Internet-enabled tools people can use to control lights, thermostats and other parts of their home .
For enterprises, meanwhile, the company wants to let employers harness the power of  Big Data  from their Apple devices.
A lot of other companies don t need to be as bold on a frequent basis as  Apple,  Soumen Ganguly, a director at consulting firm Altman  Vilandrie & Co.
CNET ahead of Apple s latest commercial launch.
But people have come to expect it from Apple.
A sense that Apple may be losing its bite hasn t kept investors from bidding up its shares, it s worth noting -- the company s stock has risen nearly 26 percent this year.
If there are questions about Apple s creative mojo, it is clear from Tuesday s event that its marketing instincts remain intact.
Sources at Apple have confirmed to Cult of Mac that the NFC chip on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will only be used for Apple Pay when it launches this week.
Like Touch ID on the iPhone 5s, Apple is keeping NFC closed off from developers at launch.
The company declined to comment on future plans for the NFC chip, but unlike Touch ID on the iPhone 5s, you won’t find any Apple marketing materials promoting the addition of NFC as a major iPhone 6 feature, as it’s touted as just a component of Apple Pay.
Bluetooth LE has been Apple’s go-to communication protocol for iBeacons and other location services, but opening the NFC chip up to developers could quickly expand the iPhone’s capabilities in the future.
All is not lost for developers hoping to see NFC API’s in the future, as the NXP-manufactured NFC chip Apple is using in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus appears to be capable of providing open access to the NFC controller, according to experts PC Advisor spoke with at RapidNFC.
Apple has already showed that its NFC chip has extended capabilities beyond Apple Pay.
For example, the Apple Watch was demoed unlocking a hotel room with NFC at last week’s Apple event.
Considering that its touch-less payments system is brand spanking new, it’s not surprising Apple wants to keep access tight while testing the NFC waters.

Would Apple ever agree to support it, or should Google target Windows Phone instead?

Yesterday, Apple pushed a rather spooky security update for iOS that suggested that something was horribly wrong with SSL TLS in iOS but gave no details.
I ve no idea what the code review culture is like at Apple but I strongly believe that my colleagues, Wan-Teh or Ryan Sleevi, would have caught it had I slipped up like this.

China Mobile is experiencing tremendous 4G wireless customer growth which is good for Apple.
A few weeks ago, Fitbit publicly admitted that it had no plans to follow the growing crowd of fitness trackers and apps that are rushing to integrate with Apple’s HealthKit and Health app.
In response, it seems, Apple has pulled Fitbit devices.

Business Wire] - Bank of America today began offering its customers and merchants access to Apple Pay, a new mobile payments service that provides an easy and secure way to pay.
Legendary hedge fund manager Carl Icahn thinks Apple stock should be trading at $203 per share based on his earnings expectations for next year.
Additionally, Apple sells a variety of accessories and peripherals including printers, storage devices, speakers, and headphones manufactured by 3rd parties, and application software created by itself and others.
Under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple s co-founder who returned to head the company in 1996, Apple has demonstrated considerable acumen in implementing high-technology in product design and marketing, generating sustained enthusiasm and substantial growth as it continues to redefine and re-invent whole new markets.
Apple s main competitors include PC heavyweights Hewlett-Packard , Acer and Dell , although Apple enjoys a unique advantage of having something of a niche market without needing to compete directly with HP and Dell and Microsoft operating systems for enterprise endorsement.
Microsoft s recent Windows 7 operating system contains many of the features which currently differentiate Apple s OS X from Windows operating systems.
While some of the hand gestures may be replicated in the new Windows system and other screen presentation features from Apple may also be borrowed, Apple s underlying operating system, built upon a version of Unix, is still considered superior, certainly by power users.
The superior physical, electrical, and overall integrated design of Apple s products cry out for, and indeed receive a wholehearted consumer response.
Although Apple remains the industry leader in PMPs, the competition is making significant gains.
The popularity of flash-based PMPs is problematic for Apple, which has much stronger market presence in hard-drive based  HDD  players.
To combat this, Apple may release a new flash-based line of players, in addition to a souped-up and rehauled version of HDD iPods.
All three of these distribution channels offer significantly higher image quality than much of what is available on Apple TV.
Apple s iPhone must compete with established mobile phone and PDA companies, including the likes of ]  , Motorola , Nokia , and Sony , many of which have significantly larger R&D budgets than Apple.
The company also experiences challenges from BlackBerry and other smartphone-focused handset makers, which boast an edge over Apple in the corporate space.
Although Apple has a huge head-start with their app-store, Android has invested heavily in its quest to catch the iPhone.
Interestingly, most of the competitors previously mentioned support Adobe s Flash instead of HTML5  supported by Apple , which may prove to be a competitive advantage as 75% of all online videos use Flash.
Although Apple does not support Flash in its webpages, but allows mobile app developers to code using Flash  .

As part of the transition, Apple told me today that they will no longer be developing its professional photography application, Aperture.
With the introduction of the new Photos app and iCloud Photo Library, enabling you to safely store all of your photos in iCloud and access them from anywhere, there will be no new development of Aperture,” said Apple in a statement provided to The Loop.
The new Photos app will also replace iPhoto, giving users a more seamless experience on Apple devices.
The app will allow you to edit and search your entire photos library in the cloud on any of your Apple devices.
It’s far too early to simply assume “it’s just a reworked iPhoto”, based on one phrase in a statement not even directly published by Apple.
Given the sensitive nature of this announcement, would you agree Apple could have done a better job communicating it?
It makes sense to combine the 2 apps into one app and respond in a consumer or pro way to whatever camera is being used, and to have only one kind of cloud library for Apple to manage on the back end.
The other alternative would be Apple abandoning the pro photography market to Adobe, which would put Apple in the same situation that they were in during the 1990′s when they had to go begging at Adobe for them to port Premiere to Mac OS X, which is what resulted in the creation of Final Cut Pro and the purchase of Logic.
The vast majority of Apple users want a simple solution to sync, store, and organize shots taken chiefly with their iDevice; the 95% solution.
And as an aside, FCP was bought from Macromedia, not developed internally at Apple.
Aperture is the #4 top grossing app over in the Apple App Store.
Since iOS 7 was released, I’ve become convinced that Apple had to move in this direction.
The vast majority of photos created in the Apple ecosystem are never edited, and aren’t as extensively curated by the photographer as was the case even 5 years ago.
If Apple were to cater solely to what “the vast majority” of their users did on their computers, do you really think they could sell a lot of $2000-3000 computers in an age where a $600 PC can accomplish the same tasks?
Which suggests either 1  they think OSX and OSX-only apps, and Apple’s design features and quality provide them lots of value or 2  somehow Apple and only Apple can convince huge numbers of people to spend three time as much money as needed on a computer?
Is this some weird Apple mind control?
I said they were capable of doing what “the vast majority” of Apple customers probably use their computers for  email, web browsing, light office work, light photo management, music video consumption.
I believe it is an influential minority of Apple customers that make better use of their computers’ potential and these people evangelize the brand and help inspire others to buy Apple products.
The question is why develop two separate applications when Apple’s new mantra is to give the stuff away?
It will be a truly odd move though if Apple can combine the consumer and professional apps into a single program.
Can Apple build organizational tools that will satisfy everyone?
The interesting thing, I think, is that Apple communicated this at all.
The smart money is on Apple working on Photos for a year  probably more, maybe much more  already.
What if I don’t want to pay Apple to store my photos?
Will Apple own or assume rights to my photos  as many cloud licenses decree ?
What are the cloud licensing complications of Apple storing photos that I don’t own  such as those borrowed from the web or licensed from stock images houses ?
Will Apple own or assume rights to my photos  as many cloud licenses decree ?
Certainly didn’t intent to sound hysterical or panicked — just asking a set of questions based on what I had read: “The big change with Photos compared to Apple’s own iPhoto app image-storing app is that the former relies on iCloud for storage.
I can’t find it anywhere on Apple’s website.
The Loop would post anything other than what was provided by Apple.
Stupid Apple.
Why Apple?
If Apple is giving up on the Pro Community, why should a Company like Adobe not give up on the Mac?
I decided to go with Aperture as I’m a 30 year loyal Apple user and put my money on them improving Aperture and, in the meantime, I had my own workflow that got me around any Aperture limitations — slow processing of larger RAW files being one.
When it comes to program software, Apple seems to start something and then move away and there is always a wait for an replacement and your never sure what it is going to until it is released.
According to TechCrunch, Apple will continue to provide compatibility updates to allow Aperture to run on OS X Yosemite, but development will stop.
The cold hard reality is that Apple is a consumer products company now – has been since the iPod took off.

I am a die hard Apple fan, but this blow hurts.
Or you can use GrannyPhoto TM  by Apple  TM  that may or may not be offered next year, and whose details will only be announced to you when the execs at Apple finally decide on which designer jeans look the most “organic” and “tech-chill” for their speech at the keynote.
Or you can use GrannyPhoto TM  by Apple  TM  that may or may not be offered next year, and whose details will only be announced to you when the execs at Apple finally decide on which designer jeans look the most “organic” and “tech-chill” for their speech at the keynote.
Adobe is much better in this arena, and I am just embarrassed to say I put faith in Apple when buying APERTURE in January.
Perhaps Apple will continue to release Digital Camera Raw updates to OS X  which is how iPhoto and Aperture get support for new cameras .
And perhaps Apple will support a graceful migration of Aperture and iPhoto libraries to the new Photos application.
We’ve seen lots of speculation, but given that we do NOT know what the Photos application will offer, it’s simple FUD to say Apple’s photo ecosystem is extinct.
That screenshot is very interesting, as it implies a lot more control possible with Apple’s new Photo’s app than was demoed at WWDC.
And I can’t find it anywhere on Apple’s site or PR material.
Will Apple provide at no cost increased iCloud storage capacity to cope with what will inevitably be large datasets ?
Where did you hear that Apple is working with Adobe on a Lightroom upgrade path?
On the other hand, Adobe seems almost certain to do such a thing, and doesn’t actually need Apple to actively help, does it?
I haven’t seen any quote from Apple indicating they were working with Adobe on anything.
I ran all Apple Pro apps for years  Logic, Aperture, Final Cut  and I’m sorry but this is real blow.
I’m not happy with Adobe’s scheme but since it doesn’t cost much more to use the whole master suite this transition may end my decade long relationship with Apple pro apps.
This is not like when Apple updated Final Cut.
It wasn’t so in the beginning  I used Aperture for a while, it was the best in the beginning  but then Apple basically stopped developing it, where as Adobe moved right along.
The conversion from Aperture to Lightroom is a pain in the ass though, but I can’t blame Apple for killing an app they obviously don’t care about anyway.
I’m no adobe champion, I just found Aperture to be terrible in many ways, and it was clear that Apple had no interest in developing it any further.
If that were the case, why wouldn’t Apple just say so and spare themselves the negative backlash?
And the verbiage in Apple’s statement does not suggest they have any intention of including pro-level functionality in the new Photos app.
This will make a lot of otherwise loyal Apple customers think twice about embracing their technologies in the future.
I hope Adobe feels free to make Lightroom’s interface more usable by borrowing some of Apple’s great ideas.
I hope Adobe feels free to make Lightroom’s interface more usable by borrowing some of Apple’s great ideas.
And all that stuff Apple told us about new APIs to allow plugins to operate DIRECTLY on RAW data, so the adjustments are EDITABLE?
It magically syncs to the Apple Photos Match service.
But, just like iTunes Match, Apple notices it already has a similar photo of the Grand Canyon in the cloud, so no need to actually upload yours!
Where, exactly, is Apple QUOTED as saying they will offer a Lightroom upgrade path?
You’re right … I had read another article that talked about Apple helping with a migration path to Lightroom, but when I looked for it, it seems that the statement has since been retracted.
I’m hoping that Apple plans to make the new Photos app closer to Aperture’s capabilities than to iPhoto’s.
I purchased Aperture in order to have full control over the production of printed Apple photo books  as opposed to having to deal with pre-formatted styles in iPhoto .
FWIW, the TechCrunch article about this announcement also says that Apple will work with Adobe to help transition users to Lightroom.
The problem with this statement is Apple has made this or a similar announcement with the termination of other pro apps.
Professionals make software decisions largely based on future support – and Apple, time and time again, is proving they cannot be relied on for professional level software.
If it’s W8-level ugly I’ll buy a used iMac, but Apple will not be getting another cent from me.
My humble opinion is that Apple will allow developers to add features to the Photos app through the new Extensions API.
I was surprised Apple mentioned Photos in the WWDC Keynote given its 6-9 months away at best.
Long wait time for an Apple product.
Will Apple continue to provide and update the RAW formats for non-Apple cameras?
Is Apple NUTS?
Sit tight and lets see what the Photos app is all about or if Apple has another game plan up its sleeve for pro photos.
I wonder if Apple even realizes they punched us in the guts with this news.
Even if Photos or whatever Apple’s next product is does everything that Aperture does today  which I seriously doubt given what was stated by Apple today and their other migrations such as iMovie and Final Cut  I will have to relearn everything I do.
This is a decision influenced by Apple’s increased popularity amongst general consumers.
In the past, even if nothing else were going well, Apple could count on creative pros like graphic artists and filmmakers, and they could count on Apple.
I was puzzled as Aperture began to atrophy from lack of attention from Apple, now I’m a little perturbed.
As much as I hate to say it, this appears to be one of those never-would-have-happened-on-Jobs’-watch decisions – abondoning Apple’s photographers to Adobe.
It will be hard to trust Apple with the remaining Pro Apps  FCP X and Logic X .
Tell to Apple, please, that here in Italy  Europe , with the slowest Internet connection in the Western world, it is absolutely useless to have photos in the cloud.
With his true connections at Apple, one wonders why the rumormongers out there don’t check with him first before spreading unreliable news.
This is pretty much the end of the line of me and Apple.
As a 30 year user, a person who convinced his school board to put in Apple labs instead of PC labs, who has sold millions of dollars of Apple equipment over the years, it’s time to say goodbye.
I know Apple will say, I had lot’s of warning and it was my fault.
Well Apple that might be true.
With the loss of Aperture, Apple product is a hindrance to my work flow, not a help.
It’s hard to bleive that charging me $200 a year, Apple couldn’t make money doing what photobucket and godadday charge me less than $100 a year for.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t Apple  in their last year’s conference  use Apperture as one of the great examples of how the new Mac Pro can be used by professionals?
I’m slowly but steadily losing confidence in the Apple we all love.
OK, Macs are still quality HW, but HW alone will not sell and we all know it and Apple should know that too.
Very disappointed to see Apple kill off yet another great tool  Aperture  I depend on.
If this matters to you, let Apple know.
I’ll hope for the best, that Apple will have Aperture-level tools built into optional settings in Photos, or will offer an Aperture Plug-in or Extension, even at an additional cost… But.
While I understand the technology and cost issues  some of which is Apple’s fault for neglect ; my major issue is the cowardly way this was announced.
This doesn’t seem very Apple to just go and announce the end of development of Aperture to ONE news outlet.
The introduction of the Mac Pro pretty much proves that Apple isn’t giving up on their pro market.
Is true that in Windows we will find better ones, but of course much more expensive, and this is one indication that demonstrates that Apple cares and wants to mantain the profesional target.
I hope that Photos will improve in all Aperture and mantain the professional status that Apple wants.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t Apple  in their last year’s conference  use Apperture as one of the great examples of how the new Mac Pro can be used by professionals?

Okay, it goes on the wrist, and it happens to tell the time, but that s about where the similarities between Apple s just announced watch and the hand-assembled, often painstakingly finished mechanical watches we write about, and obsess over, end.
I was lucky enough to be invited to Cupertino to witness the announcement of the Apple Watch firsthand, and though I do not believe it poses any threat to haute horology manufactures, I do think the Apple Watch will be a big problem for low-priced quartz watches, and even some entry-level mechanical watches.
Read on to hear my thoughts on the Apple Watch, from the perspective of a watch guy.
I won t get into the raw functionality of the Apple Watch – for that, refer to my colleague Kelly Jasper s introductory article here .
Instead, I ve chosen to focus on the many things I believe Apple got right and those I believe they got wrong, all the while viewing this piece of wearable technology not as a digital peripheral, but as an actual watch.
Essentially, what our friends in Switzerland can learn from Apple, and what Apple can learn from the Swiss.
The overall level of design in the Apple Watch simply blows away anything – digital or analog – in the watch space at $350.
There is nothing that comes close to the fluidity, attention to detail, or simple build quality found on the Apple Watch in this price bracket.
Then, for closer to the price of the Apple Watch, you could own this , which is, well, downright horrific in just about every conceivable metric.
The Apple Watch feels like a lot of thought went into it, and no doubt it did.
The rounded edges are very Apple, even very Marc Newson, who, based on absolutely nothing but a gut feeling, I m sure had something to do with the design of the Apple Watch.
Not dissimilar to the way the screen of the Apple Watch wraps into the body.
And the strap found on the Apple Watch Sport ?
Jony Ive s friendship with Newson is well documented and it s possible they simply shared ideas over drinks, or maybe Newson was entrenched in the project, imparting all he learned at Ikepod with his friends at Apple prior to the announcement he d join their ranks.
The Apple Watch is available in both 38 mm and 42 mm.
This may not seem like much, but remember this is Apple s first watch, and it would be a very easy mistake to make it too big or too small.
The Apple Watch, in its own way, really pays great homage to traditional watchmaking and the environment in which horology was developed.
The fact that Apple chose to develop two faces dedicated to the cosmos shows they are, at the very least, aware of the origins and importance of the earliest timekeeping machines, and the governing body of all time and space – the universe.
I expect that we will see many developments on the face front when the Apple Watch hits stores.
Okay, so it s a  digital crown  on the Apple Watch, but for a company founded by a man known for his distaste of buttons and switches, the fact that they kept the original horological control center says something.
Sure, it is critical to the UI of the Apple Watch, but I was surprised to see that they hadn t attempted a device that is completely void of physical controls.
There are so many different variations on the Apple Watch it s hard to keep it all straight.
There is the normal Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport, and the Apple Watch Edition.
Does that mean there is an Apple Watch for everyone?
No, it doesn t, but it reinforces Cook s message that this is Apple s most personal device, offering a range of options that can fit someone s varying lifestyle.
I guarantee that there are a very high number of people out there who just adore the standard Apple Watch, and hate the Apple Watch Sport.
Similarly for the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition, because though it received over 2,000 likes on Instagram , many of the comments were quite negative.
In addition to offering a bevy of options from leather to fluoroelastomer to link bracelets to Milanese, it is here that you really see how much attention Apple was paying to the way people wear watches, and the how bad existing options were.
The Apple Watch can take an integrated strap or bracelet, or one with wire lugs.
The fact that Apple even knows what this is is remarkable.
The 42 mm Apple Watch on this bracelet was the one I was determined to try on first, and here it is on my wrist.
Again, Apple has paid excruciating attention to detail in the design and wearability of the Apple Watch.
What surprised me the most about the introduction of a large ish  device, complete with a screen and not simply a wearable, is that it shows Apple is comfortable not having its object worn by a significant percentage of early adopters who normally flock to their launches.
They tend to want things that are beautifully made with great purpose – in a nutshell, Apple products.
But what makes the millions of us who would never trade a Rolex in for an Apple is the emotion brought about by our watches – the fact that they are so timeless, so lasting, so personal.
My watches will last for generations; this Apple Watch will last for five years, if we re lucky.
On an emotional level, you can t compare them, and that is why I don t believe many serious watch lovers  who, again, would normally be racing to spend their cash on an Apple release  will go for this.
It s directly competing for the same real estate, whereas if we had seen a bracelet of some kind announced yesterday, those early adapters, myself included, would be begging Apple to take their pre-pre-pre-order  truth be told, I ll obviously be buying one, but you know what I m saying .
If I had to criticize the actual form of the Apple Watch, it would be a complaint you ve heard from me before   most recently with the Habring2 in our latest Three on Three  ; the Apple Watch doesn t fit under my shirt cuff without serious effort, if at all.
Apple is amazing at building thin, elegant machines, and I was surprised by how bulky this is, especially when the 45 minutes prior to the introduction of the Apple Watch were spent discussing how svelte the new iPhone 6 is.
I understand the physical limitations and the required dock on the rear of the watch, but the Apple Watch is bulkier than I would ve liked.
Could I have likely figured out a better solution for all that went into the Apple Watch to make it thinner?
The Apple Watch is an incredible piece of engineering, no doubt.
Do you see him wearing the Apple Watch?
I do see him buying the Apple Watch, but it will need to go further than that.
I m not sure the same can be said about the Apple Watch because things like my Patek Philippe 3940G exist, and they always will.
The biggest concern those in the mainstream press have with the actual functionality of the Apple Watch is that it must be tethered to an iPhone.
During yesterday s hands-on session we asked that directly to Apple PR, and they didn t have an answer at that moment.
The Apple Watch is absolutely the best smartwatch on the planet.
If anyone can make it happen, it s Apple.
Will anyone be trading in their Lange Double-Split for an Apple Watch?
But, will the average Lange owner buy an Apple Watch, wear it on the weekends, and then, after a great workout with it, decide to leave it on next for a vacation to the beach, and then maybe on casual Friday to the office?
So while certainly not direct competition for haute horology watchmaking right now, the Apple Watch is absolutely competition for the real estate of the wrist, and years down the road, it could spell trouble for traditional watches even at a high level.
At the lower end, I believe the Apple Watch is a serious threat to those less faithful lovers of analog watches.
There is a certain percentage of the population that simply doesn t care if they re wearing a watch of any great manufacturing process and the Apple Watch will appeal to them, if it works as advertised.
The other thing that could spell trouble even for the Swiss is Apple s cool factor with the young.
At 16, will someone want a Swatch or an Apple watch?
At 20, will they want a Hamilton or the Apple Watch 3?
At 25 will they want an Omega or an Apple Watch Plus?
That should be a very real concern for the Swiss – appealing to a younger generation of buyers who live and breathe Apple.
Again, Apple paid great attention to detail with this new wrist-bound peripheral, and it shows the Swiss that it is possible to have great design at low costs.
That is the most exciting thing about the Apple Watch for me – it will push the Swiss to take the sub-$1,000 mechanical watch category more seriously.
The Apple Watch is slated to ship in early 2015, and you can be sure we ll put its through its paces once available.

A screenshot from Apple s announcement of Apple Pay.
Alongside the iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch this afternoon, Apple Apple also unveiled the Apple Pay, the company’s attempt to do what Google Google could not and replace your wallet with your phone.
Though many predicted the announcement of an Apple mobile payment platform, the Apple Pay arrives with a little less buzz than the iPhone 6 and certainly less glamour than the Apple Watch, and perhaps for good reason: its debut comes as conversations over digital security have reached a fevered pitch after  yet another retailer confirmed a data breach  and two weeks after an iCloud hack that exposed nude images of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton .
And, not to mention, it arrives in the wake of eBay’s “One Touch PayPal” and Venmo Touch, which some analysts think can withstand the threat from Apple.
The service will work with the three major payment networks — American Express, MasterCard and Visa — and Apple said that there are 220,000 merchant locations that accept these contactless payments.
But for all the glitz and glamour around Apple’s iPhone 6 and Apple Pay, Citi’s Mark May projects that eBay and PayPal will be able to stand its ground and gain a not-insignificant share of that $58 billion in mobile proximity payments.
Not all of Apple’s consumer-facing mobile apps have succeeded  e.
What’s more, May calculated that based on factors like the iOS market share and PayPal’s average take rate, less than one half of one percent of PayPal’s revenue is at risk from Apple Pay.
Meanwhile, if Apple Pay encourages consumer migration to mobile payments in general, and not just Apple, May says that PayPal could record nearly $15 billion in NFC-based payment volume by 2017.
As FORBES’ Brian Solomon reported , shares of Apple immediately spiked 4.
Cook’s Apple Pay announcement while eBay sank 2%; shares of Apple are currently up 1.
Note: You will be asked to sign in with your Apple ID in the next step.

If Apple Pay is the future, the future won t be here any time soon.
On Monday, Apple turned the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus into a virtual wallet with an update to iOS.
With Apple Pay, you snap a photo of your credit card and your iPhone stores it virtually on a special chip inside.
But the problem with Apple Pay isn t the mechanics and ease of use, it s that you likely won t have much of an opportunity to try it at first.
Over the last several days, only a few stores I visited in San Francisco had the special NFC payment pads necessary to accept Apple Pay.
Yes, major stores like Whole Foods, Walgreens, and Panera Bread all accept Apple Pay, but the vast majority of retailers do not.
Apple says there are over 200,000 Apple Pay-ready retail locations, but that s just a sliver of the retailers in the US.
Since Apple Pay launched, I ve eaten in restaurants, bought groceries, gone out to bars, added money to my BART ticket, and just generally engaged in everyday commerce.
I think I was only able to use Apple Pay three times.
And one of those times was when I purposefully went to Walgreens so I could test Apple Pay on launch day.
From the beginning, Apple Pay was marketed as a way to replace your wallet.
Meanwhile, there s some evidence that retailers are blocking Apple Pay payments, even though they have the pads designed to accept it.
On Saturday, we learned that Rite Aid and CVS seemed to be blocking Apple Pay .
The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that Best Buy doesn t plan to accept Apple Pay for a similar reason.
I m also not convinced Apple Pay is easier than swiping a credit card.
During the iPhone 6 launch event in September, Apple showed a video where a woman had to fumble around with her credit card before she could swipe it.
APThe Apple Pay demo made using a credit card seem difficult.
In fact, depending on the type of terminal, the transaction might not be as seamless as Apple showed in its demo.
It ll get better, and I m not ready to call Apple Pay a dud this early.
And while Apple Pay works with most major credit cards, there are still a lot from smaller banks that don t work yet that have to get on board.
I bet the allure of being tied to a brand like Apple will entice a lot more retailers and banks who want to appear on the cutting edge to join.
Plus, Apple Pay has the potential to be a lot more secure than normal credit cards.
But for now, Apple Pay is just a minor convenience, a geeky-cool way to buy stuff until it and other payment systems are as widely accepted as regular old credit cards.
Previously, as we reported in May 2014 , if law enforcement came to Apple with a seized device and a valid warrant, it was able to access a substantial portion of the data already on an iPad or iPhone.
Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data.
In an open letter also published Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook took a direct swipe at Google, its primary mobile competitor.
Previously, Apple only mentioned one specific company-made app—Mail—that was protected using this system, while noting that  third-party apps installed on iOS 7 or later receive this protection automatically.
Now, however, that section of the September 2014 document specifically refers to Messages, Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and Photos, which suggests that Apple has significantly expanded what data on the phone is encrypted.
Finally, Apple also highlighted a new secure addition in Mail.
Mail leverages certificates for authenticated and encrypted Mail by supporting S MIME, which, as of iOS 8, permits per-message S MIME, so S MIME users can choose to always sign and encrypt by default, or selectively control how individual messages are protected,  Apple wrote.
Our lives are on our smartphones, and Apple is right to realize that users do not want to pay twice for products—with their money and with their privacy.

Alibaba chairman Jack Ma and Apple CEO Tim Cook are a pair of business titans with one-syllable names heading up two of the most powerful companies in the world.
Around 50 of nation s largest retailers, including CVS and Rite Aid as well as big-box giants such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are banding together to roll out their own mobile-payment software independent of Apple.

Apple finally made its big entry into the wearable technology market on Tuesday, unveiling the Apple Watch, its long-anticipated smartwatch.
It’s the next chapter in Apple’s story,” declared Apple CEO Tim Cook during a packed event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino, California.
Despite plenty of pre-event chatter that the device would be available in time for the holiday season, the Apple Watch will not be out until early next year, priced from $349.
As expected, Apple also unveiled new additions to its iPhone family at the event, with Cook launching the 4.
The phones also mark the debut of Apple Pay, a contactless mobile payment technology.
Companies working with Apple on Apple Pay include Mastercard, Visa and American Express and retailers such as Target and Whole Foods.
Tech analysts had hoped that Apple would launch the watch in time for the lucrative holiday season, particularly at a time when rival Samsung is ramping up its efforts in the smartwatch space.
Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the new Apple Watch in Cupertino, Calif.
Consumers, however, should not see the Apple Watch as a replacement for their existing devices.
During his speech, Cook made it clear that the Apple Watch is not a standalone device, explaining that the watch is designed to work with the iPhone.
Three versions of the watch were launched at the event – Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, a high-end version of the technology built using 18-karat rose or yellow gold.
Smartwatch technologies have hardly set the world alight, so consumers were keen to see how Apple plans to set itself apart from rivals.
The Apple Watch certainly boasts some interesting features, such as its ‘Digital Crown’ – a small dial on the side of the device that is used to navigate through the watch’s screens.
During his speech, Cook explained that the device’s small screen made it impractical to transfer the iPhone interface to Apple Watch.
Other features of Apple Watch include a “taptic engine,” which subtly vibrates to let users know when they have received a message or a notification from a source such as Facebook.
Apple has also built sensors into the back of the Apple Watch to monitor vital signs such as heart rate and support the company’s drive into health and fitness technology.
Pund-IT, said he was surprised that Apple will not launch its smartwatch until 2015.
King also noted that some Apple users may face a costly upgrade if they want to use the Apple Watch.
The device only works with iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, 6 or 6 Plus running iOS8, the latest version of Apple s operating system.
I am sure that there are plenty of Apple fans who will pay that, but I have trouble seeing it as widely adopted as the iPhone.
Nerval s Lobster writes Everybody knows that Apple runs a tight ship when it comes to approving iOS apps for its App Store, rejecting software because it features porn, allows gambling, installs types of executable code, etc.
But Apple also denies apps for some pretty esoteric reasons, many of which are only just coming to light .
Sorry, that s not allowed, presumably because Apple doesn t want iOS to serve as a drone controller.
Also, apps that report your location to emergency services are forbidden, as well as any that misspell Apple product names   iTunz  will never make it through, no matter how much you beg .
Even if Apple s not sharing the exact reason why it just rejected your app from its store  what the heck does  Not enough lasting value  mean?
The move will make it impossible to pay for products using Apple Pay or Google Wallet .
Rite Aid posted at their stores:  Please note that we do not accept Apple Pay at this time.
MojoKid writes When Apple debuted its A8 SoC, it proved to be a modest tweak of the original A7.
Despite packing double the transistors and an improved GPU, the heart of the A8 SoC is the same dual-core Apple  Cyclone  processor tweaked to run at higher clock speeds and with stronger total GPU performance.
Given this, many expected that the Apple A8X would be cut from similar cloth — a higher clock speed, perhaps, and a larger GPU, but not much more than that.
The Apple A8X chip is a triple-core variant of the A8, with a higher clock speed  1.
It also uses an internal metal heatspreader, which the Apple A8 eschews.
Though the card comes from Apple with the ability to support  and be switched among with software, if a change is necessary  all major carriers,  AT&T is not supporting this interchangeability and is locking the SIM included with cellular models of the iPad Air 2 and Retina iPad mini 3 after it is used with an AT&T plan.
AT&T appears to be the only participating carrier that is locking the Apple SIM to its network.
T-Mobile s John Legere has indicated that T-Mobile s process does not lock a customer in to T-Mobile, which appears to be confirmed by Apple s support document, and Sprint s process also seems to leave the Apple SIM unlocked and able to be used with other carrier plans.
Verizon, the fourth major carrier in the United States, did not opt to allow the Apple SIM to work with its network.
By turning itself into a premium PC company with a proprietary OS , Apple has taken the best of PC ecosystem, but avoided taking on the disadvantages.
Dave Knott writes One of the few remaining examples of Apple Inc s first pre-assembled computer, the Apple 1, sold for $905,000 at an auction in New York on Wednesday.
Only 63 surviving authentic Apple 1 s were listed in an Apple 1 Registry as of January out of the 200 that were built.
The auctioned computer is thought to be one of the first batch of 50 Apple-1 machines assembled by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in Steve Job s family garage in Los Altos, California in the summer of 1976.

It would seem that no matter how you configure Yosemite, Apple is listening.
But Apple doesn t share this focus on interoperability or legacy.
Apple has long sold Bose headphones and speakers in its retail stores, including in the time since it acquired Bose-competitor Beats Audio , and despite the lawsuit filed by Bose against Apple alleging patent violations on the part of Beats.
That s come to an end this week, though: Apple s dropped Bose merchandise both in its retail locations and online, despite recent news that the two companies have settled the patent suit .
Having launched a perfectly-timed attack against Samsung and phablets with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Leonid Bershidsky suggests that the next big thing from Apple will be a tablet-laptop a la Microsoft s Surface Pro 3 .
Before yesterday s Apple  event,  writes Bershidsky,  rumors were strong of an upcoming giant iPad, to be called iPad Pro or iPad Plus.
I ve been expecting a touch-screen Apple laptop for a few years now, and keep being wrong.
John Siracusa writes that Yosemite is particularly notable because it s the biggest step yet in Apple s efforts to bring OS X and iOS together — new technologies are now being added to Apple s two operating systems simultaneously.
Siracusa also takes a look a Swift , Apple s new programming language:  Swift is an attempt to create a low-level language with high-level syntax and semantics.
But Apple no longer views the Mac in isolation, and neither should you.

Now Apple is looking to revolutionize computing with the iPad.
Now that Apple has officially swallowed Beats, Ian Rogers, the head of Beats’ subscription-music service, will also oversee the iPhone-maker’s iTunes Radio efforts, according to people familiar with the matter.
Dre, have joined Apple.
On its website, Apple posted a short message welcoming the Beats team.
Music has always held a special place in our hearts, and we’re thrilled to join forces with a group of people who love it as much as we do,” Apple wrote .
By acquiring Beats Music, a $10-a-month streaming service, Apple puts another music option alongside iTunes Radio, a free ad-supported offering.
Rogers, a former Yahoo executive, will run both teams to create cohesion in Apple’s streaming-music options, according to the people familiar with the matter.
As part of the acquisition, Apple is cutting 200 of the more than 700 jobs at Beats Electronics, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The person said the affected positions will come from areas such as human resources, finance and support services, where there will be considerable overlap after Beats is part of Apple.
